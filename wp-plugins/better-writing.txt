You can select from one of 5 different readability scoring methods including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flesch reading ease formula<\/li>\n<li>Coleman Liau index<\/li>\n<li>Gunning fog index<\/li>\n<li>SMOG Index<\/li>\n<li>Automated readability index<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You are able to see at a glance if your content is on target with the readability meta box on the WordPress edit screen. You can also set a custom target score and sort posts and pages by readability.<\/p>\n<p>All features can be turned on or off for posts, pages or even custom post types.<\/p>\n<p>Use details of your readability score elsewhere within WordPress by using shortcodes.<br \/>\n*   [readability-score]<br \/>\n*   [readability-method]<br \/>\n*   [readability-flesch]<br \/>\n*   [readability-coleman]<br \/>\n*   [readability-gunning]<br \/>\n*   [readability-smog]<br \/>\n*   [readability-ari]<\/p>\n<p><strong>Preferred terms<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Consistent use of language is important and is something that can easily suffer, especially where multiple writers are involved. Better Writing allows you to maintain a list of your preferred terms and non preferred terms. It will prompt writers and editors with spell-check style suggestions in the content editor. It will check as you type and allows for multiple terms and multiple suggestions.<\/p>\n<p>All features are designed to be non-intrusive and let you get on with your work, whilst giving you the tools you need to help you write better without distraction.<\/p>\n<h3>Credits<\/h3>\n<p>Credit to Dave Child for use of https:\/\/github.com\/DaveChild\/Text-Statistics.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Extract the zip file and place the contents in the wp-content\/plugins\/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<ul>\n<li>Version 1.4 &#8211; Fixed a minor, bug. <\/li>\n<li>Version 1.3 &#8211; Added shortcodes. <\/li>\n<li>Version 1.2 &#8211; Readability algorithm improved for pages with more complex html.
