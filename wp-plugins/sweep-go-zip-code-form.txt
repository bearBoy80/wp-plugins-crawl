The plugin can be used by business owners or their website designer to embed the service area checker within their WordPress website.<\/p>\n<p>Business owners use the zip code checker to qualify their website visitors based on location and redirect to their client onboarding form. If a multi-location business, a prospect will be redirected to a location associated with the zip code entered.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses must already be registered and have an active account with Sweep&amp;Go Pooper Scooper App in order to use the service area checker.<br \/>\nAfter a WordPress website visitor enters a zip code to request a free quote, the plugin relies on the 3rd party service also owned by the plugin developer.<\/p>\n<p>More specifically the plugin talks with sweepandgo.com API and sends the zip code, organization unique identifier (several if multi-location business) based on plugin settings and receives a link to the client onboarding form.<\/p>\n<p>The Sweep&amp;Go created and operates by the following terms of use (https:\/\/www.sweepandgo.com\/terms-of-use\/)  and privacy policy (https:\/\/www.sweepandgo.com\/privacy-policy\/)<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload and unzip <code>sweepandgo-zip-code-form.zip<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the \\&#8217;Plugins\\&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release of Sweep&amp;Go Service Area Checker.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug for form styling after initial setup<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin tested on WordPress 6.0 and updated description<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed PHP 8+ bug<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sweep-go-zip-code-form\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2501596\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sweep-go-zip-code-form\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2501596\" alt=\"Organization Onboarding Settings\"><\/a><p>Organization Onboarding Settings<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sweep-go-zip-code-form\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2501596\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sweep-go-zip-code-form\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2501596\" alt=\"Zip code form comment styling\"><\/a><p>Zip code form comment styling<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sweep-go-zip-code-form.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sweep-go-zip-code-form\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2501596","caption":"Organization Onboarding Settings"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sweep-go-zip-code-form\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2501596","caption":"Zip code form comment styling"}},"tags":{"poopscoop":"poopscoop","sweepandgo":"sweepandgo"},"versions":{"1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sweep-go-zip-code-form.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sweep-go-zip-code-form.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sweep-go-zip-code-form.1.0.3.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sweep-go-zip-code-form.1.0.4.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
