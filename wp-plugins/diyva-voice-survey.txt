It can be used for gathering customer satisfaction, product reviews, and questionnaires on any topic. Voice provides a frictionless and easy interface for customers to quickly provide their opinions about your service.<\/p>\n<p>Use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.diyva.org\/welcome\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">DIYVA Application<\/a> to easily create and customize voice-based customer surveys and dialogs. Then link to your survey or dialog from the DIYVA plugin.  Customer responses are recorded and accessible to you from the DIYVA application. Individual responses can be viewed, and an analytical dashboard that provides a summary of all responses. Dialogs can be updated at any time. Conditional flow dialogs can be defined where the answers to one question can determine the responses and the next questions to ask. FAQ-based voice dialogs are also supported where customers can ask questions using their voice, and the best matching answer is provided as a voice response.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about creating DIYVA voice-based surveys, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/diyva.life\/wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">how-to guide<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Shortcodes<\/h3>\n<p>[diyva_voice_dialog]<\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>From Dashboard ( WordPress admin )<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>plugins -&gt; Add New<\/li>\n<li>search for &#8216;diyva voice survey&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>click on Install Now and then Active.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>using FTP or similar<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Unzip &#8220;diyva-voice-survey&#8221; file and <\/li>\n<li>Upload &#8220;diyva-voice-survey&#8221; folder to the &#8220;\/wp-content\/plugins\/&#8221; directory.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20started%3F'>\nHow do I get started?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https:\/\/diyva.life\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our website<\/a> to create an account and the questions you want to ask your users.
