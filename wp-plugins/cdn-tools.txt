You can sideload data to a commercial CDN or just load your larger JS libraries (prototype, jquery) for <strong>free<\/strong> from Google&#8217;s servers.  CDN Tools has been designed to be as easy to use as possible, so give it a shot!  Your blog&#8217;s readers will thank you.  At this time the only commercial CDN supported is Cloud Files.  Check out the plugin homepage to view a screencast.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1.0 requires you to reload your files! Do not upgrade until you&#8217;re ready to reload.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Catch new releases and other information about my plugins by following <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/reaperhulk\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@reaperhulk<\/a> on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/langui.sh\/cdn-tools\/\" title=\"CDN Tools Home\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">View complete changelog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>CDN Loader Dev FAQ<\/h3>\n<h4>How do I create a new CDN class?<\/h4>\n<p>Create a directory in cdn_classes named whatever the shortname will be.  Then create a file named loader.php inside with the same basic structure as the cloudfiles loader and do everything right. Then edit the cdn-tools.php file to add your item.  Easy as pie (if your pie is made of complexity).  I promise I&#8217;ll write some better instructions so third parties can contribute CDN plugins at some point.  Currently CDN Tools probably makes some assumptions that are Cloud Files specific.<\/p>\n<h3>License<\/h3>\n<pre><code>Copyright 2010 Paul Kehrer\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If you write a plugin, please let me know so I can merge it into the main distribution.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I found a bug. What do I do?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contact me!  This is a complex plugin and the only way I can ensure it&#8217;s robust is to get bug reports and fix the problems that crop up.  Please include as much information as you can when reporting (PHP version, your blog&#8217;s site, the error you saw and how you got to the page that caused it, et cetera).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WP 3.0 compatibility<\/li>\n<li>Changed method of storing info about sideloaded files to be far more robust.<\/li>\n<li>Use directory structure on Cloud Files (uses just one container now)<\/li>\n<li>Now CDNifies post thumbnails as well (WP 2.9+ feature)<\/li>\n<li>Fix for blogs using SSL<\/li>\n<li>Caches credentials for more rapid initial loads\/multiple media attach uploads.<\/li>\n<li>You can now define constants in wp-config for plugin configuration. This allows to configure settings that will be active on all end-user sites without allowing them to see\/edit the config. If you define constants the CDN Tools admin page will not register a configuration page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.99<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Log retention support (in advanced options)<\/li>\n<li>Servicenet flag (in advanced options)<\/li>\n<li>Both these features were added courtesy of John Dickinson<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.98<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 2.9 support.  CDN Tools can now handle the image edit system introduced in WP 2.9.<\/li>\n<li>Better error handling for a few scenarios.<\/li>\n<li>As of this release WP 2.7 is no longer supported.  It might work, but future releases will almost certainly break it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.97 &#8211; 12\/9\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial sideload AJAX used an absolute path with the siteurl.  This should have been a relative path or the adminurl to accommodate situations where FORCE_SSL_ADMIN is defined.  Thanks to John for identifying the bug.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.96 &#8211; 12\/4\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgraded and (temporarily) forked CloudFiles API to fix bugs related to safe_mode and content type detection.  This means you shouldn&#8217;t see badcontenttype exceptions or &#8220;stuck at 0%&#8221; errors any more!<\/li>\n<li>Improved error reporting for AJAX uploads (including timeout errors, which are now set at 90 seconds)<\/li>\n<li>Removed loading.gif in favor of WP native spinner<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.95 &#8211; 10\/25\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgraded to CF API 1.5.1. For users within the Rackspace network who have $_ENV[&#8216;RACKSPACE_SERVICENET&#8217;] defined, CDN Tools will now use the servicenet instead of the public network.  This should speed sideloading of large files as well as not consuming your bandwidth.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.94 &#8211; 10\/19\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgraded to CF API 1.4.  This should resolve some cURL issues users have experienced and removes the dependence on a png hack for RHEL4 users.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed major issue with Google AJAX CDN.  Previously users were unable to switch between visual and HTML mode on the edit post page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.93 &#8211; 10\/8\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A partial fix for issues with customers who have full file paths stored in their postmeta table.  This is not a complete fix, but should help some (most?) users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.92 \u2013 10\/5\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Major upgrade to support WP 2.8. If you are a previous user of CDN Tools you MUST unload files and then load them again. Please let me know if you have issues because several major changes were made.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.81 \u2013 5\/17\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Major upgrade to the initial load for attachments. Now done via AJAX with percentage progress.<\/li>\n<li>Additional exception handling (this is still incomplete)<\/li>\n<li>Upgrade to CF API 1.3.0.<\/li>\n<li>WordPress MU compatible (credit John Keyes)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.72 \u2013 2\/25\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First public release, no changes from previous.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.72 \u2013 2\/22\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Small bugfixes<\/li>\n<li>WP Super Cache compatibility.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.71 \u2013 2\/22\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Workaround for a MIME\/PHP bug on RHEL4.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.7 \u2013 2\/17\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nearing completion of initial feature set.<\/li>\n<li>UI rework (again)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.6 \u2013 2\/15\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Huge improvements on all fronts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.4 \u2013 2\/8\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial sideload support.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.2 \u2013 2\/7\/2009<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First release outside of my own work (seeded to Major Hayden).<\/li>\n<li>GoogleAJAX for Prototype, jQuery, Dojo, and mootools (free for anyone to use)<\/li>\n<li>Uploading JS to CloudFiles (only supported CDN presently)<\/li>\n<li>Supports opting
