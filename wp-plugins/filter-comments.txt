Negative comments on your blog posts has been a nightware for every blogger, but now you can easily remove bad words from your post comments.<\/p>\n<p>Filter Comments perform following functions:<br \/>\n* Specify words that needs to be replaced\/removed<br \/>\n* Specify a replacer e.g. replace &#8220;ugly&#8221; to &#8220;nice&#8221;<br \/>\n* View actual comment from the dashboard<br \/>\n* Add as many words as you like<\/p>\n<p>If you want to remove the word altogether, you can just leave the &#8220;Replace with&#8221; field and that work will no longer appear in your post comments.<\/p>\n<h3>Credits<\/h3>\n<p>The idea for Filter Comments came from a desire that you do not have to review each and every comment before approve.
