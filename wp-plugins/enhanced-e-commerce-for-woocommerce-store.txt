The goal is to make it easy for users to research purchases, find information about different products, their features and prices, and then connect with sellers to make their purchase. Google Shopping enables users to view product information from the sellers that is updated on a regular basis by sellers. Online retailers submit feeds containing product information to Google Shopping. Since this product information comes directly from the seller, this means we\u2019re able to show the current prices, latest offers and current product availability. Hence, Google Shopping helps ecommerce businesses find more customers to their websites.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20sellers%20enroll%20for%20google%20shopping%3F'>\nHow do sellers enroll for Google Shopping?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Create Merchant Center Account: Once you have an account open, verify important details like your business and contact information.<br \/>\nUpload your products: Prepare your product info to submit through a feed, or automatically sync your product data from e-commerce shop<br \/>\nShow your products across Google: Opt your product data into programmes, like surfaces across Google, Shopping ads, local inventory ads and Shopping Actions, to highlight your products to shoppers across Google.<br \/>\nOur plugin helps WooCommerce shop owners in automating everything that is required to get eligible for Google Shopping.

He uninstalled this plugin and added 6 others to my site without even asking me. Fortunately I had a full backup and was able to remove all the garbage he added and go back to Conversios. Then I contacted their amazing support. They took over and in under an hour, we were up and running with this plugin. Great support, great communication and awesome plugin. Why overload your site with multiple plugins when this one does everything you need for tracking!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Can&#039;t recommend the plugin!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/sebastianfuglsang\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6b8d59505e207cd8f51cc8576bc4d175?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6b8d59505e207cd8f51cc8576bc4d175?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/sebastianfuglsang\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">sebastianfuglsang<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 6, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Can't recommend the plugin!<br \/>They're refusing to refund me for the recurring subscription even though I contacted them well before the recurring period and told them that I would like to cancel my subscription since I wasn't using the plugin anymore.<br \/><br \/>Smells like scam to me.<br \/><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great support and updates<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mellaker\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7fd312b329696070d033043e0a96845c?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7fd312b329696070d033043e0a96845c?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mellaker\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">mellaker<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 30, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">As Google added the possibility fort weight shipping I reached out to the support and they added that in their plugin.
