This will prioritize loading other resources first to increase page loading speed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>JS Optimization<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Move all JS to footer ==&gt; Page Speed measurement tools will usually recommend that you remove render-blocking JavaScript and CSS out of the  tag. This will prioritize loading other resources first to increase page loading speed.<\/li>\n<li>Inline all JS ==&gt; Inline JS will reduce the number of requests to the server, and Inline JS will avoid blocking the initial page load to help the website be more appreciated.<\/li>\n<li>Minify all JS ==&gt; Minify JS will eliminate unnecessary characters, making it less expensive to load the page<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Html Optimizations<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minify HTML<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Minification refers to the process of removing unnecessary or redundant data without affecting how the resource is processed by the browser &#8211; e.g. code comments and formatting, removing unused code, using shorter variable and function names, and so on.<\/p>\n<h4>Add Expires headers<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Set expires header CSS<\/li>\n<li>Set expires header JS<\/li>\n<li>Set expires header Media<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expires headers tell the browser whether they should request a specific file from the server or whether they should grab it from the browser&#8217;s cache.<\/p>\n<p>The whole idea behind Expires Headers is not only to reduce the load of downloads from the server (constantly downloading the same file when it&#8217;s unmodified is wasting precious load time) but rather to reduce the number of HTTP requests for the server.<\/p>\n<p>When you visit a website your browser is responsible for communicating with the web server to download all the required files.
