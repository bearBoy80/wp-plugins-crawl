Simply create folders and subfolders, and then drag and drop items directly within the media library. When you are ready to use attachments in your content, find them easily by selecting their folder. No more sifting through thousands of items to find the right one!<\/p>\n<h3>Features<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Hierarchical File System<\/strong><br \/>\nCreate folders and subfolders, just like in a real file system.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Virtual File System<\/strong><br \/>\nAcclectic Media Organizer creates a virtual file system, so all links to your media files will remain the same and continue to work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Direct Upload to Folder<\/strong><br \/>\nUpload new items directly to a folder simply by selecting the folder when you add them to the media library.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Detailed upload status tracker<\/strong><br \/>\nA detailed upload status tracker keeps you up-to-date when uploading many files to a folder.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rearrange Folders<\/strong><br \/>\nRearrange your folder tree by simply dragging and dropping folders directly within the folder tree.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Drag &amp; Drop Items<\/strong><br \/>\nAssign attachments and media items to a folder by simply dragging and dropping them onto the folder in the folder tree.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Edit Folders Via Context Menu<\/strong><br \/>\nCreate subfolders, rename, or delete a folder by a convenient context menu directly in the folder tree.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Resizable Control Panel<\/strong><br \/>\nThe control panel is designed to be comprehensive but unobtrusive, and it is easily resizable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Filter Items When Attaching<\/strong><br \/>\nSee only the items you want when adding attachments to posts and pages by clicking on the appropriate folder in the media browser dialog.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Multi-Mode Support<\/strong><br \/>\nAcclectic Media Organizer works in both List and Grid modes in the Media Library.

All of your existing files will be kept in their existing physical folders, and any links pointing to them will continue to work without change.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%27ve%20used%20other%20file%20organization%20plugins%20in%20the%20past%3F'>\nWhat if I&#8217;ve used other file organization plugins in the past?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since Acclectic Media Organizer creates a separate virtual file system, any organization you make will not be affected by any similar plugins you&#8217;ve used in the past or may use in the future.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20export%20my%20media%20folders%20to%20another%20server%20or%20computer%3F'>\nCan I export my media folders to another server or computer?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin does not support doing so directly within the plugin, but it is a feature we plan to include in the future. However, it is possible to do so by exporting and importing the database tables that host the virtual file system. Please contact support if you&#8217;d like help on this.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='if%20i%20rearrange%20or%20delete%20folders%2C%20will%20i%20lose%20my%20files%3F'>\nIf I rearrange or delete folders, will I lose my files?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. When you move or rearrange folders, the files will keep their assigned folders. When you delete a folder, items in the folder will simply become unassigned, but will never be deleted from the file system.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20move%20multiple%20files%20at%20a%20time%3F'>\nCan I move multiple files at a time?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!

In the list view, select multiple items with check-boxes, and then drag them to the destination folder.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.4 &#8211; September 14, 2022<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed
