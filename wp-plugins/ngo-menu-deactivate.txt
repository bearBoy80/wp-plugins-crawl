Most settings are based on user permissions, so for super-admin, it does not change much, but for site-admin it cleans up the backoffice a great deal. It also adds a bit of extra security by redirecting users not permitted to edit a post directly to frontoffice, and disables the admin bar for them.<\/p>\n<p>See documentation on <a href=\"https:\/\/ngo-portal.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/ngo-portal.org<\/a> for more information about NGO-portal and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/joje47\/NGO-portal\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub<\/a> for the code and documentation about this plugin.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/plugin-name<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>This plugin has no settings, but by commenting out changes you don&#8217;t need you can adapt it for your needs.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>None as of now<\/h4>\n<p><\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Latest stable release<br \/>\nInitial release to the WordPress repositorium<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ngo-menu-deactivate\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1555456\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ngo-menu-deactivate\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1555456\" alt=\"\"><\/a><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ngo-menu-deactivate.1.1.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ngo-menu-deactivate\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1555456","caption":""}},"tags":{"branding":"branding","multisite":"multisite","network-sites":"network sites","portal":"portal","site":"Site"},"versions":{"1.1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ngo-menu-deactivate.1.1.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ngo-menu-deactivate.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/ngo-portal.org\/donera\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ngo-menu-deactivate\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1555456","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ngo-menu-deactivate\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1555456"}}
