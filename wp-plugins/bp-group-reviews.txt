Error received:<\/p>\n<p>Warning: Missing argument 2 for wpdb::prepare(), called in \/public_html\/wp-content\/plugins\/bp-group-reviews\/bp-group-reviews.php on line 147 and defined in \/public_html\/wp-includes\/wp-db.php on line 990<\/p>\n<p>Decided to hold off on reviewing it (don't like to pass reviews out that easy) to do some research and couldn't find another plugin that offered this functionality or solutions to fix it without having to hire someone with more knowledge than myself. Bummer I thought. <\/p>\n<p>So I want to give my groups meetup.com-like functionality which includes reviews for meetups so I was going to do what it takes to get reviews functionality integrated into my Buddypress groups even if it meant hiring a developer. <\/p>\n<p>Long story short, I decided to again install the plugin just now to see if I could possibly fix it and it literally installed without any hitches. It is working great and I know have the Buddypress group reviews functionality I want! <\/p>\n<p>The only thing I can think of is that maybe the latest WordPress update (literally released a few days ago) has fixed something that was breaking the plugin prior.<\/p>\n<p>So I was considering giving this plugin 1 star when I initially installed it because it was broken, and now I was considering giving it 4 stars (now that it is working!) because it doesn't appear to be updated regularly anymore, however, because it is literally the only plugin I could find that offers this feature (and it is working now!) I am going to give it 5 stars. Honestly, it also works great (now!), and looks great on my site. NOTE: Depending on your theme, css will likely need to be tweaked to get it just right. <\/p>\n<p>Anyways, go ahead and give the plugin a try. If it gives you the weird error, disable plugin, remove it, and then re-install it and see what happens. Maybe that fixed my issue, though I'm more inclined to believe the latest WordPress update was what fixed it. <\/p>\n<p>@boone Boone Gorges, @apeatling Andy Peatling, if you guys read this review by some chance, can you update this plugin\/check to see if everything is good (no security holes, full compliance with new wordpress\/buddypress, etc). I think review functionality is crucial to extend Buddypress groups and I would love to see more downloads and 5 star reviews of your plugin. Thanks!!!\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.3.2.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"buddypress":"buddypress","group":"group","groups":"groups","rating":"rating","review":"review"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.0.3.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.1.zip","1.1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.2.zip","1.2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.2.1.zip","1.2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.2.2.zip","1.2.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.2.3.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.3.zip","1.3.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.3.1.zip","1.3.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.1.3.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bp-group-reviews.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/teleogistic.net\/donate","banners":[]}
