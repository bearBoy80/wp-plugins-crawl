If you don&#8217;t know what the webhook URL should be you can check the admin page for this plugin on your wordpress instance to see the default address. The secret can be anything you want (as long as you remember it), but you must make sure the following events are ticked:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>payment.authorized<\/li>\n<li>payment.captured<\/li>\n<li>payment.expired<\/li>\n<li>payment.cancelled<\/li>\n<li>payment.refunded<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ensure that the &#8220;Active&#8221; checkbox is also ticked and then click &#8220;Create Webhook&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Go back to your WordPress instance and set the &#8220;Webhook Secret Token&#8221; value on the Komoju Woocommerce plugin to be the same as the secret set for the webhook.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='what%20versions%20of%20woocommerce%20is%20this%20compatible%20with%3F'>\nWhat versions of WooCommerce is this compatible with?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>At the moment, this plugin has been tested and is known to work up to version<br \/>\n6.3.1.
