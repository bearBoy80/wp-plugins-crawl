Because WordPress has to work everywere, it uses the portable version of phpass,<br \/>\nwhich uses MD5 to hash passwords. MD5 is not a very good hashing algorithm for passwords, because it&#8217;s relatively fast.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin switches over to bcrypt, which is the algorithm recommended by phpass, and is a much better option for password<br \/>\nstorage because it is much slower to produce. This makes it much harder for an attacker who&#8217;s managed to access your hashed<br \/>\npasswords to obtain plain text passwords by brute-forcing, or by trying passwords from a dictionary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note: this plugin requires PHP 5.3.0 or newer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Be aware that if you use this plugin and then move to a host that does not support bcrypt, you will need to reset any user<br \/>\naccount that you want to log in with.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>wp-bcrypt<\/code> directory to the <code>wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>How do you change the hashes?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Users&#8217; hashes are changed to bcrypt when they first login in after the plugin is activated. All of WordPress&#8217;s built-in functions<br \/>\nwill use bcrypt too, when intially creating an account, changing your password, or adding a password to a post.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What happens if I deactivate the plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>As long as you have bcrypt support (PHP 5.3.0 or newer) WordPress will happily continue checking passwords that are hashed using<br \/>\nbcrypt. Everything should work fine. But any new passwords you hash (for a new account, or changing an existing account) will be<br \/>\nmade using MD5.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Readme improvements<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Is it work with wordpress 4.9?<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/momosampaii\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/95ded9189bf10557405b817eebed6ae1?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/95ded9189bf10557405b817eebed6ae1?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/momosampaii\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">momosampaii<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 2, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Is it work with wordpress 4.9?\n\nThanks<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-bcrypt.1.0.1.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"passwords":"passwords","security":"security"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-bcrypt.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-bcrypt.1.0.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-bcrypt.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
