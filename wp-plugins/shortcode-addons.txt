For example, more than 50% of users of <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong> believe that they could use the page builder much better if they had coding knowledge. Shortcode Addons will make those users satisfied; as their shortcomings due to not having coding knowledge will be mitigated to a massive extent with the help of our shortcodes.<\/p>\n<p>Every single element they would ever want to use is available and fully compatible with all page builders, even <strong>Divi<\/strong>, <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and <strong>Elementor<\/strong>. Shortcode Addons- with <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, <strong>Divi<\/strong>, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and Elementor Extension is built-in Major Page Builders Including <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, <strong>Divi<\/strong>, <strong>Elementor<\/strong> and <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong> Extension. No other similar plugin will give you this many options. Already the addon count is 108, and we are working relentlessly to increase the number even more. We are hoping to make the plugin more compatible with even the newest of page builders as well.<\/p>\n<p>Page Builder in WordPress is a very down to earth feature that gives maximum flexibility to develop a website. You can build your own website without knowing any complex coding or anything backend development. But, no matter how good these page builders are, still it is not possible to find everything on the same plate. It is a bit too much to ask from any page builder or theme to be as perfect as your imagination. For example, you might want a specific type of price table that would be convenient for your e-commerce store. You can\u2019t blame the page builders or themes if they don\u2019t have something according to your unique needs. This is where Shortcode Addons enters. That single plugin will be the game changer in your next website project. With more than 120+ widget options, this is everything you would ever need!<\/p>\n<p>Unleashing the full power and potential of page builders is no longer for experts only.

But it doesn\u2019t end here. You will also get the possible support from the brilliant development team that has worked relentlessly to make the plugin at the users\u2019 convenience. You will receive equal treatment regardless of the skill level you have on WordPress. For learners or experts, support will always find a way to help.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of Using Shortcode Addons in Page Builders<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We believe that WordPress is for everyone, and a plugin description should explain everything in detail. That\u2019s why we are going to explain what the role of shortcodes in WP page builders actually is here. If you are an experienced WordPress user and already know what shortcodes are, then you can skip this part and continue reading below. But if you are a beginner, then we would highly recommend you to understand the mechanism of shortcodes within page builder before you start working with the Shortcode Addons plugin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Countless Options<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WordPress users always look for more flexibility. On top of that, WordPress is quite famous for providing users with that as well. The way WordPress has achieved that is by having wonderful plugins. And now this has gotten even better with the page builders. For instance, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong> will help you to get complete control of your website, even though you are working with WordPress. It was thought that WordPress users will always have to settle for limited fixed options, and they will never have full freedom while developing with WordPress. But <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong> has proven that completely wrong.<\/p>\n<p>With such flexibility, it might get a bit overwhelming at times. In many cases, it is seen that users are installing too many plugins to develop one single website. This is quite inconvenient. This happens because different plugins take care of separate small parts of web development through WordPress. It might get really tough for the users to keep track of it. When too many plugins are installed, it is also possible that the website speed will receive a downturn. Even a page builder like <strong>Elementor<\/strong> suffers from the same problem when it is used alongside so many plugins.<\/p>\n<p>So, wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if all the major builders including <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, <strong>Divi<\/strong> or Elementor could be handled and used without having to use so many other plugins? Shortcode Addons- with <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, <strong>Divi<\/strong>, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and Elementor Extension will enable you to do exactly that. As it has so many shortcode elements built in it, you will hardly need any other plugin to make sure that your page builder gives you the ultimate web development experience.<\/p>\n<p>As you can have different styles and colors for each element you find in our plugin, it will be much more convenient for you to give your website a unique look without having to spend too much time in developing the website\u2019s backend.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fully Responsive<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The design and the functions of your website will not matter if the visitors can\u2019t visit from different devices and get a good experience. Sites that are not responsive don\u2019t look good on devices with smaller screens like phones and tablets. As a result, phone and tablet users stop visiting that particular site. However, it is important to make sure that everyone gets to receive all the features and functionalities of your website regardless of the device they are using. Otherwise, you are going to end up losing potential traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Traditional page builders try their best to make sure that their built-in themes and page elements are as responsive as possible. <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong> and <strong>Divi<\/strong> claim that their site elements and themes are totally responsive. But that can\u2019t happen every single time as your unique necessities might hamper the responsive characteristics of the site in the first place. Or, you might not be able to afford the premium versions of <strong>Divi<\/strong>, <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong> or <strong>Elementor<\/strong>, that provide one of the most useful responsive page building elements out there. If you are using less known page builders, then responsiveness might become a big issue.<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, for keeping the brilliant designs done with amazing page builders, Shortcode Addons- with <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, <strong>Divi<\/strong>, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and <strong>Elementor<\/strong> Extension will be a great addition and complementary tool. While choosing the widgets or elements from this plugin, there is no need to worry about the responsiveness of the site. No matter which style and color you have chosen for widgets like countdowns, events or accordions, every single time you will receive maximum responsiveness which will keep the site\u2019s user experience more or less the same in all devices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Very User-Friendly Plugin<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Do you know why the number of people who work with brilliant software programs is way too low? The answer is very simple. It is because those programs are quite tough to handle. At times, working with page builders might seem quite complex as well. Beginners find it really difficult to create a good website using <strong>Elementor<\/strong>. Though <strong>Elementor<\/strong> has a very easy to use UI, people get overwhelmed with all those functions and features at one place.<\/p>\n<p>But that would not be the case if you are using our latest Shortcode Addons- with <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, <strong>Divi<\/strong>, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and <strong>Elementor<\/strong> Extension. Our awesome plugin will not only help you build sites easily, but also will enable you to use seemingly complex page builders like <strong>Elementor<\/strong> and <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong> effortlessly. The mechanism behind applying the widgets or elements using Shortcode Addons is so simple that people who don\u2019t have any kind of coding experience at all are able to take full advantage and improve their site-building skills overnight.<\/p>\n<p>Shortcode Addons- with <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, <strong>Divi<\/strong>, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and <strong>Elementor<\/strong> Extension also packed with loads of pre-designs, templates and section blocks so that you don\u2019t need to worry about creating anything at all. We have everything in our box for you, you just need to open it!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ergonomic User Interface<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Shortcode Addons- with <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, <strong>Divi<\/strong>, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and <strong>Elementor<\/strong> Extension has every single element a webpage might need, and all of those elements are designed beautifully. You can change the designs according to your choice by changing colors, sizes and so many more. And guess, every single combination looks great. I don\u2019t think <strong>Divi<\/strong> users will still complain anymore if they get their hands on the awesome design tool like Shortcode Addons. People having minimum design knowledge often create websites that are so charming to the audience. And guess what? They can do such wonderful work because people like us made plugins like Shortcode Addons for them!<\/p>\n<p>The other reason why people don\u2019t want to use complex software and programs is they don\u2019t find the programs comfortable to handle. It happens due to a UI full of too many tools. And guess what, most of the tools displayed on the UI are never used. Shortcode Addons- with <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, <strong>Divi<\/strong>, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and <strong>Elementor<\/strong> Extension is totally free from that. The UI is designed in such a way that you will only see what you need in the UI and you can use those necessary options straight forward. Such UIs are quite rare these days because very often developers go for more options at the cost of compromising with user experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SEO Friendly Algorithms<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Shortcode Addons- with <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, <strong>Divi<\/strong>, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and <strong>Elementor<\/strong> Extension is kind of a plugin which has an SEO friendly algorithm in its framework. The developer team behind this awesome plugin understands the importance of SEO very well. After all, we have to make our own website visible in the search engine as well, if we want to stay in the business for long enough. That\u2019s why Shortcode Addons is created in such a way that it doesn\u2019t hamper your site\u2019s SEO ranking, rather boosts it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong> users at times suffer substantial downfalls in the search engine. No, we are not saying that it is solely <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>\u2019s fault, but the way the site has been built. The page builders like <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong> or <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong> will not tell you what to do for ensuring the best SEO practices for your site. It is quite understandable as well. The page builders expect you to have some minimum SEO knowledge if you are thinking of ranking the site well. Users, who lack that, might suffer in terms of ranks.<\/p>\n<p>So, simply use Shortcode Addons with <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, <strong>Elementor<\/strong> or Divi for creating the killer SEO combination. With our fully customized, flexible addons, you will be able to put your targeted keywords at any place on your webpage, so that Google\u2019s robot\u2019s don\u2019t ignore you when they are visiting your site.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode Addons Maintains Site\u2019s Speed<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Shortcode Addons- with <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, Divi, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and <strong>Elementor<\/strong> Extension is well aware of site speed as well. Because for the SEO ranks, another very important factor is obviously the site speed. At times, heavy design and plugins can reduce the site speed as the page becomes way too heavy. The mighty Shortcode Addons- with <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, Divi, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and <strong>Elementor<\/strong> Extension has taken care of that as well. The size of your web pages will be kept at a minimum level. Nothing is ever compromised in Shortcode Addons.<\/p>\n<p>Though the designs might look really huge and complex, you will not have to worry about a significant reduction in site speed as those designs are optimized in a way that your site speed will never be compromised. So, when Google\u2019s algorithms will see that your site is loading in no time, your site\u2019s rank will skyrocket in no time. In addition, the UI of your site will be better too because the site visitors will also get relieved when they will see such a huge site being loaded in fractions of seconds. Now, how cool is that!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode Addons is Great for Business<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Shortcode Addons- with <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, Divi, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and <strong>Elementor<\/strong> Extension is a great tool for boosting your business. Who doesn\u2019t want to make money? Our Shortcode Addons can help you to make money in multiple ways. If you are already earning money online, then your earning might get a massive boost if you implement Shortcode Addons. If you are not earning online yet, but have plans to do so, then that will be helped as well. Here below, some of the money-making activities which can get Shortcode Addons advantages enormously are explained briefly:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Earn Money By Affiliate Marketing<\/strong> Affiliate marketing is a great classic way of earning money online. There are so many cases of earning millions of money through affiliate marketing. For affiliate marketing, the driving force is website traffic. No, Shortcode Addons- with <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, Divi, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and <strong>Elementor<\/strong> Extension will not say every internet user in the world to come and visit your website. No plugin can do that. But what our plugin will do is, it will help you create such a website which will attract users.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Users are attracted by site designs and loading time, along with the content the site has. If your site has good content, then compliment that to the highest extent with our wonderfully designed elements and widgets. You\u2019ll see the result in no time.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sell Websites<\/strong> The other way to earn is to build and sell websites. In this era of digital marketing, every single business requires a website. Not just big corporations, but also small startups that are opened very recently need their own websites as well. The online population is increasing day by day. This large amount of traffic is a massive hunting ground for digital marketers. That\u2019s why no business is willing to fall behind in terms of covering the online market. However, that\u2019s why the need for website building services is at the top of its peak. With page builders and Shortcode Addons, you can create such websites that will sell for big money.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Let me tell you a secret. If you are only using a page builder, let\u2019s say Divi, your chances of selling the site for a massive sum once it\u2019s built is not that big. Do you know why? Because a page builder like Divi is already quite famous. The number of developers who use this wonderful tool is quite big. That\u2019s why you won\u2019t be able to provide your customers or client with a unique experience and service. The same is true for the other famous options as well. <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong> is already overused, you can tell that the site is built by <strong>Elementor<\/strong> when you see it and <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong> has become clich\u00e9 as well.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>So, what is the solution to this? Is the solution going for newer page builder options that nobody has ever heard of? Of course not! There are lots of risks associated with it. If you choose lesser-known options, then they might not be good enough at the end of the costing you even more. But you have to win the competition after all, right? The secret is, use these overused page builders, but in a new way. Shortcode Addons is that new way.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Using Shortcode Addons along with page builders will make your site really unique. The massive range of designs will never give it away that you have even used a page builder to build your site. If your customer understands that you have used a page builder, they would like to pay you less. Because they will know that you haven\u2019t spent hours after hours writing complex codes for the site, rather you have built the site with little to no labor. If you purchase the premium version of the plugin, you might have to pay a lump sum of money, but the amount of profit it will bring you is quite attractive.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>We Provide Best Help and Support<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Last but not the least, whenever you are looking forward to implementing a plugin like Shortcode Addons- with <strong>Visual Composer<\/strong>, Divi, <strong>Beaver Builder<\/strong>, and <strong>Elementor<\/strong> Extension, you need to consider the help and support you will receive from the developer team.
