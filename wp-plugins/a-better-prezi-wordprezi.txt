It even supports different delays for each slide!<\/p>\n<p>The only bump that incredibly better prezi player solution encounters is it relies on the standalone player which was designed to &#8220;look&#8221; for the required files in the SAME directory as the page it&#8217;s on, searching for those files in EVERY directory you are at only.<br \/>\nYou&#8217;ll notice that once your prezi looks pretty as you created it, it fails because of missing files if embedded in several pages (like in WordPress header) and uploading those files (around 20MB) to every directory your pages are in is not an option.<br \/>\nJust install this plugin and all your prezi presentation will run smoothly no matter how many pages you embedded it in, by using advanced apache redirection rules in your server.<\/p>\n<p>(Only compatible with Linux hostings, for now. You&#8217;ll know if your WordPress is running on Linux if your articles urls look like name-of-article, rather than index.php?p=308)<\/p>\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrates Slidedynamic&#8217;s prezi player, the only prezi player that kicks your embedded presentation out of the &#8220;waiting for click&#8221; ugly state, pre-loads it, gets rid of low-res preview and GIANT presentation name blocking your presentation, and allows per-slide delays).<\/li>\n<li>Registers your prezi application player in your server to be found anywhere,<\/li>\n<li>No need to edit apache files<\/li>\n<li>No FTP access needed<\/li>\n<li>Many auto-features coming!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Future features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>One-click Slidedynamic player install and uploading<\/li>\n<li>Support for Windows servers<\/li>\n<li>Shortcode and functions to place a presentation effortless<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to rate it and tell it works! &rang;&rang;&rang;&rang;&rang;&rang;&rang;&rang;&rang;&rang;&rang;&rang;<\/p>\n<h3>Instructions<\/h3>\n<p>Install and activate.<\/p>\n<p>If you ever edited your .htaccess file, make sure your manually created rules are <code>outside<\/code> the #Wordpress markers, or they will be deleted.
