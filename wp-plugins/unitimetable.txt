It includes teachers, classrooms, subjects (modules) and student groups, which are all combined to define lectures. The lectures can be scheduled at some time point during a semester. Out of schedule events and holidays are also supported.<br \/>\nAfter providing the plugin with data, shortcodes provided generate beautiful calendars with all or selected part of the entered data.<\/p>\n<p>UniTimetable was designed by <strong>Fotis Kokkoras<\/strong> and <strong>Antonis Roussos<\/strong> and implemented by Antonis Roussos for the fulfillment of his BSc Thesis in the <strong>Department of Computer Science and Engineering<\/strong>, at <strong>TEI of Thessaly<\/strong>, Greece.<\/p>\n<h3>Translations<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>English &#8211; default, always included<\/li>\n<li>Greek &#8211; default, always included<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Note:<\/em> Translations refer to the user interface (admin panel and calendar). All the content will be always displayed in the language inserted. You can not translate a timetable. If desired so, the only way is to build a new calendar in another language.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire UniTimetable folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the <code>Plugins<\/code> menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Find <code>UniTimeTable<\/code> menu in your WordPress admin panel and use the forms provided for data entry.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>How to use the Shortcodes:<\/p>\n<p>The general purpose shortcode is <code>[utt_calendar]<\/code> and should be better placed in a page (or post) with substantial width (the calendar is responsive though and fits everywhere). The resulting calendar includes two filter drop-down lists for the end-user to select individual calendars for any of the semester, classroom, or teacher.<br \/>\nIn case that a fixed calendar is required (without drop down filters), parameters can be added to precisely define the content to be displayed. Three parameters are supported: classroom, teacher and semester. Here are some examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[utt_calendar classroom=1]<\/code> will display the schedule of classroom with ID=1.<\/li>\n<li><code>[utt_calendar classroom=1,2,3]<\/code> will display the schedule of classrooms with IDs 1, 2 and 3.<\/li>\n<li><code>[utt_calendar teacher = 12]<\/code> will display the lecturing program of teacher with ID 12.<\/li>\n<li><code>[utt_calendar semester = 2]<\/code> will display the lecturing program of the semester with ID 2.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> <em>You can locate the IDs required in the corresponding forms in the UnitimeTable admin page. Comma separated IDs are supported in all cases.<\/em><\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<p><em>Release Date &#8211; 26 October 2015<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow commas on Holiday Name, in case of two simultaneous Holidays.<\/li>\n<li>Spelling mistakes were corrected.<\/li>\n<li>Corrected Practise Exercises which were shown like Laboratories.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed problem with Lectures deletion and edit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<p><em>Release Date &#8211; 21 August 2015<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Initial Release.<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unitimetable\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1232624\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unitimetable\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1232624\" alt=\"Resulting timetable with filtering drop-down lists (the example data are in Greek).\"><\/a><p>Resulting timetable with filtering drop-down lists (the example data are in Greek).<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unitimetable\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1232624\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unitimetable\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1232624\" alt=\"The main admin page of the plugin.\"><\/a><p>The main admin page of the plugin.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unitimetable\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1232624\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unitimetable\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1232624\" alt=\"Form for managing subjects (the example data are in Greek).\"><\/a><p>Form for managing subjects (the example data are in Greek).<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unitimetable\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1232624\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unitimetable\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1232624\" alt=\"Lecture management form.
