This means that you can now, for club runs only, offer your open packs to be edited. We call it&#8230; the Allocator method!<\/li>\n<li>Note: You are unable to offer open packs as an item on your storefront. Doing so is not supported.<\/li>\n<li>Our admin UI was a little confusing, so we asked our new guy to take care of it. He added new tabs and made our log files look much nicer. Seriously, we don&#8217;t know how the new guy did it, but those logs look amazing!<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve tidied up the image code that caused some images to quietly disappeared. After speaking with the images, they agreed to make an appearance once more.<\/li>\n<li>Some hosts don&#8217;t allow us to use getallheaders(), so we&#8217;ve added a quick pinch of salt to remedy that. Errors relating to this should no longer appear.<\/li>\n<li>A closed pack sometimes led to a &#8220;minimum quantity error&#8221; message being shown on checkout. After looking into this, we&#8217;ve determined that counting carts is best left to the professionals (us).<\/li>\n<li>A club run may have let through orders with less than minimum quantities allowed. Reviewing all pieces led us to a missing piece, which peacefully lead to better compliance by all carts involved.<\/li>\n<li>For those special DBAs out there, we&#8217;ve fixed an issue, after updating, that caused us not to respect your database prefix.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, when talking to Troly, WordPress may have sent products across when it shouldn&#8217;t have. WordPress and Troly now agree that sending unwanted products isn&#8217;t cool and it won&#8217;t happen again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Version 2.8.7<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed submitting Product rating to Troly<\/li>\n<li>Fixed when editing content (Posts\/Pages) that breaks the admin UI page when Troly shortcode is present in content<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Version 2.8.6<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New Troly logo<\/li>\n<li>Add Troly credit to Footer (Divi and X themes only)<\/li>\n<li>Fixed on blank page when creating\/edit Post\/Pages content<\/li>\n<li>Fixed on Billing Mobile number not sync to Troly upon creating new User<\/li>\n<li>Fixed issue in Date of Birth<\/li>\n<li>Fixed issue in image handling so that woocommerce settings can apply<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Version 2.8.5<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue with plugin loading<\/li>\n<li><strong>Important:<\/strong> this will be the last update to support PHP 5.6.
