The widget, which was created by the team of developers at the request of the public, has to do with the fact that the owner of a WordPress site can play the live stream of our radio station, to the users who visit his site. In order for such a playback process to take place, the widget that has been constructed must constantly dial and receive the audio part from our radio station. This can only be done by calling an external &#8220;.mp3&#8221; file. In this case, the links with which the live stream of our radio station can be played are 2 in number, one link for the high quality, and another link for the low quality (depending on the choice of the administrator WordPress website):<br \/>\n&#8216;https:\/\/icecast.europeanschoolradio.eu\/live\/esradio.mp3&#8217; (For high quality), or<br \/>\n&#8216;https:\/\/icecast.europeanschoolradio.eu\/live\/esradio56.mp3&#8217; (For low quality)<\/p>\n<p>European School Radio is an internet radio, which has a live 24 hour music stream, there is a automation with which users can see which music track our internet radio is playing at the moment, as well as see which radio show or music track will be playing right after. For this reason, we wanted to integrate this feature into the Widget. But in order for this to happen, and for users to be able to watch what music played on our internet radio, an &#8220;iframe&#8221; must be built into the Widget to load a page from our site containing this information. More specifically, the link we upload to the &#8220;iframe&#8221; is the following:<br \/>\n&#8216;https:\/\/icecast.europeanschoolradio.eu\/song<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the European School Radio&#8217;s widget, you do NOT have to have an account to any service.<\/p>\n<p>Also, here you can find the terms of use of our web platform.
