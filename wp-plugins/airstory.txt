And the &#8220;locking&#8221; functions in WordPress make collaboration nearly impossible: no commenting, no co-editing.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why pro bloggers and content teams write in Airstory first then export each post to WordPress in a click, using this plugin.<\/p>\n<h3>Airstory + WordPress = Great Posts<\/h3>\n<p>Airstory is challenging the status quo for writing software &#8211; and we\u2019re starting with cutting your blog-writing time in half. Use all of Airstory&#8217;s time-saving features to draft your post. Then send it to your WordPress blog.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Imports text and images from your Airstory project<\/li>\n<li>Keeps header tags, bolding, lists and other formatting<\/li>\n<li>Uses your site&#8217;s CSS for styling<\/li>\n<li>Imports as a draft<\/li>\n<li>Lets you import draft after draft to one unpublished URL<\/li>\n<li>Supports multi-site if you have more than one WordPress blog<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Airstory is a paid solution, which includes support and integrations, like this plugin.<\/p>\n<h3>How It Works<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Install and activate the plugin<\/li>\n<li>Inside Airstory, open a project<\/li>\n<li>Choose the tab you\u2019d like to send to WordPress as a post<\/li>\n<li>Under Actions, select the blog to export to<\/li>\n<li>In the browser tab that opens, you\u2019ll see your draft in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Requirements<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin requires an active <a href=\"http:\/\/www.airstory.co\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Airstory<\/a> subscription.\n<ul>\n<li>Not already an Airstory user? <a href=\"http:\/\/www.airstory.co\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Sign up for a free trial!<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>PHP version 5.3 or higher, with the DOM and OpenSSL extensions active. Additionally, the Mcrypt PHP extension is required for PHP versions below 7.0.<\/li>\n<li>The WordPress site must have a valid SSL certificate in order for Airstory to publish content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Usage<\/h3>\n<p>Once Airstory is connected with WordPress, your site name will appear as an export destination within Airstory.<\/p>\n<p>Exporting to WordPress will create a new <em>draft<\/em> post, enabling you to set post thumbnails, publish dates, categories, and anything else your post might need before publishing.<\/p>\n<h3>Actions and filters<\/h3>\n<p>For developers, the Airstory WordPress plugin contains a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Plugin_API\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">actions and filters that can be used to modify its default behavior<\/a>.
