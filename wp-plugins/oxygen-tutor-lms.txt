It adds all the functionalities needed to create a complete WordPress LMS website using Oxygen Builder.<\/p>\n<p>To use this plugin, you must first have all the plugins installed and activated. The required plugins are:<br \/>\n *<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/tutor\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Tutor LMS (Free\/Pro)<\/a><br \/>\n *Integration Plugin<br \/>\n *<a href=\"https:\/\/oxygenbuilder.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Oxygen Builder<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>What Oxygen Builder Brings to Tutor LMS<\/h4>\n<p>Oxygen builder is a very unique and robust page builder, and you can practically create your custom made theme for an LMS platform. Thus you don&#8217;t have to rely on other third-party themes and make your website from the ground up exactly the way you want it.<\/p>\n<p>Oxygen Builder provides a plethora of features like the header builder, huge design library, and full responsiveness controls. Moreover, it also comes with a library of pre-made design sets that can be imported directly to create rich webpages. We believe with this integration activated, you can create an amazing platform for your instructors and students alike.<\/p>\n<h4>Oxygen Visual Editor<\/h4>\n<p>Like all other Oxygen enabled sites, installing Oxygen will strip out all the visuals of your old site. The visuals will now be controlled by Oxygen&#8217;s templates. Therefore, your theme will basically be useless. You will have to create Oxygen templates to properly show your content in a usable layout.<\/p>\n<p>With this integration plugin enabled, you will see a brand new tab in the editor. This tab labeled &#8220;Tutor LMS&#8221; contains all the necessary elements needed to build a perfect LMS website. Whether you&#8217;re a designer or a WordPress developer, it will suit all your needs.<br \/>\nThere are two ways of creating a course page, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a single course template<\/li>\n<li>Build your custom design using single course elements<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you add the single course template, you&#8217;ll be able to edit each of the elements. But you won&#8217;t be able to change the layout of the course page itself. To do so, you&#8217;ll need to create a custom course layout with all the necessary elements.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with the Oxygen Builder plugin, creating a new custom layout with custom headers and footers should be a breeze. We&#8217;ve added all the necessary elements needed to create a full Tutor LMS website. We\u2019ve broken down all of Tutor LMS into small elements that you can now use to create a customizable layout for all Tutor LMS pages like course page, quiz page, archive page, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>To read about every aspect of this plugin, please refer to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.themeum.com\/docs\/oxygen-builder-introduction\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation on the Oxygen Builder<\/a> integration plugin. You will find all the information on this plugin in our documentation website.<\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>Minimum Requirements<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP version 5.6.0 or greater (PHP 7.1 or greater is recommended)<\/li>\n<li>MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Automatic installation<\/h4>\n<p>The automatic installation is the easiest way to install any plugin in WordPress.

Thank goodness Oxygen lets you put in custom code and CSS or it would be unusable.\n\nThere are all sorts of aspects that are not available in the editor. You can't change the color of borders in the Dashboard or the lessons, you can't change the color of the registration button, you can't change the background color of the lesson sidebar, etc. etc. I have a giant CSS file that I've had to use just to make it work. Plus there are a bunch of things missing, like random titles that you can't change (like in the Assignments, you can change all except the \"Attachments\" title???)\n\nAnother very strange decision is that they have different templates for Lessons, Quizzes, and Assignments, but they all include the Course lesson sidebar. There's no way to edit it globally, so you have to re-do all of your styles in all of them and manually copy over all your style settings in order to get the sidebar to look the same for all of the Lessons, Quizzes, etc.\n\nIt works well but they really need to add a lot more settings. And on a minor note, there are things misspelled everywhere.\n\nStill, I'm very happy that I can use Tutor LMS with Oxygen, so I'm happy that I purchased the Pro version.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Yes!

Lo and behold, it's literally the only builder under \"integrations\" in the Tutor LMS documentation. Everything works the way it says it does. I was able to use the sidebar under \"Add Filter on Course Archive\" in Developer documentation and customize it further to work exactly how I'd like it and then insert that in Oxygen as well. Using \"pre_get_posts,\" you can filter the repeater element as you see fit.\n\nThere are a couple of issues such as the Author and Ratings elements not working in the repeater after the first query result but you can just use Code Blocks with PHP from the \"Add Filter on Course Archive\" sidebar in documentation to add these elements. It would be nice if there could be a fix for this in a future version.\n\nBut even with the quirks, I'm just so happy that you guys are supporting Oxygen like this! Thank you, thank you, thank you Tutor LMS team!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oxygen-tutor-lms.2.0.3.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"course":"course","elearning":"elearning","learning-management-system":"learning management system","lms":"lms","oxygen-builder":"oxygen builder"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oxygen-tutor-lms.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oxygen-tutor-lms.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oxygen-tutor-lms.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oxygen-tutor-lms.1.0.3.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oxygen-tutor-lms.1.0.4.zip","2.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oxygen-tutor-lms.2.0.0.zip","2.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oxygen-tutor-lms.2.0.1.zip","2.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oxygen-tutor-lms.2.0.2.zip","2.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oxygen-tutor-lms.2.0.3.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oxygen-tutor-lms.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.themeum.com","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oxygen-tutor-lms\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2241609","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oxygen-tutor-lms\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=2241609"}}
