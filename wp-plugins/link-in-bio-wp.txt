I'd rather not have to edit my CSS for one directory when I can just create a page and have the plugin point to the page styling. I haven't hacked around with the CSS to much, but thought I'd toss out that suggestion.\n\nOverall, it's a quick and easy plugin and though it says it wasn't tested with my version (5.6) or wordpress, it worked great and installed no problem. Highly recommend this over trying to use the link in bio or link tree services. If you have your own website, why wouldn't you use your own branding and URL to drive traffic to your own site? It's a no brainer, and this wordpress plugin just makes it that much easier.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Good Layout, Simple to Use, Minor Bug<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/urbancaveman\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3d66d3100a103d5dc491fda94a7cfeb9?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3d66d3100a103d5dc491fda94a7cfeb9?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/urbancaveman\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">urbancaveman<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 23, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Seem like a good little plugin. I like the layout, and it's simple to use. There's a minor bug where the option to change the url from \/links to \/something-else doesn't seem to work. I've changed it to \/instagram, but it's still going to \/links, with a 404 error at \/instagram.\n\nA nice feature go have down the road would be the ability to populate itself from the user's instagram account, then automatically create clickable links from the url in the caption, but it doesn't seem that any plugin or service has that ability. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/link-in-bio-wp.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/link-in-bio-wp\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2273519","caption":"Customizer settings."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/link-in-bio-wp\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2273519","caption":"Full width landing page."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/link-in-bio-wp\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2273519","caption":"WordPress admin archive page."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/link-in-bio-wp\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2273519","caption":"Add New Link page."}},"tags":{"instagram":"Instagram","social-links":"social links","social-media":"social media","social-profile":"social profile","social-share":"social share"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/link-in-bio-wp\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2272390","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/link-in-bio-wp\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2272390"}}
