The amount of time and effort put into this plugin is impressive. I would like to see an update to how the slide shows look - or it just maybe that I haven't found the right features yet to make changes. - there are seriously A LOT of settings. This makes this plug-in really responsive and easy to work with your theme. The developer took a lot of time to layout a well organized way to search the documentation and has even listed plugins that may cause issues. Take the time to read his Do's and Don'ts and other documentation. I hope that the developer continues to update this plugin!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Very good photo gallery plugin<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/elikeone\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/51dd5b68261e46d673d3699729d91ec2?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/51dd5b68261e46d673d3699729d91ec2?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/elikeone\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">elikeone<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">June 10, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Photo gallery with a lot of features and great support!
