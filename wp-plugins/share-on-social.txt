Now Events are triggered when a user invokes the action rather than after the action is completed. Because of the change, Twitter generates the event as soon as user clicks tweeter button which open the locker without waiting for the tweet action by the user. In other words, it is not possible to use twitter with locker anymore. So, by default, Twitter is disabled in Basic Locker.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20twitter%20button%20is%20smaller%20than%20facebook%20icon'>\nWhy twitter button is smaller than Facebook icon\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unlike Facebook, Twitter share API doesn&#8217;t allow us to change the icon.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.2 &#8211; 20 Mar 2021<\/h4>\n<p>Google Plus share feature is removed.<\/p>\n<h4>1.0.1 &#8211; 01 Apr 2017<\/h4>\n<p>Twitter button disabled for Basic locker and other minor updates<\/p>\n<h4>1.0.0 &#8211; 12 Dec 2014<\/h4>\n<p>Initial version.<\/p>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">I love this social locker-Thanks.
