This plugin allows the user to define a list of extensions they wish to allow.  Administrators can choose to allow only Administrators or all Media Uploaders to be able to add the defined types to the library.<\/p>\n<p>Note: This plugin does not permit the user to change the maximum upload size, which may be needed for large multimedia files.<\/p>\n<h3>Translation<\/h3>\n<p>Currently, the interface offers English and Spanish versions.
