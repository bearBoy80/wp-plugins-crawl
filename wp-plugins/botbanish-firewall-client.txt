BotBanish will also make a backup with the date appended to it in the root on each install.<br \/>\nIf you get a 500 Series Error on installation, it may be because of the complexity of your .htaccess file. No worries, we will help you get it right. It is most likely one line is out of place.<br \/>\nCheck our support site for more helpful information.<\/p>\n<p>The one who monitors BotBanish for WordPress should have a good understanding of PHP, SFTP and some .htaccess commands.<\/p>\n<p>What is BotBanishClient:<\/p>\n<pre><code>BotBanishClient is an application that will track and find out the BOT\/Users that are possibly attempting to do harm to your system by\nperforming brute force attacks in an attempt to create accounts on the system or probing to find vulerabilities on your site.\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>How It Works:<\/p>\n<pre><code>BotBanishClient will check each user for certain URL phrases that used to find a way to thwart the system in order to create an account\nso that they or it can SPAM the system. If BotBanishClient detects that a \"user\" is guilty of searching for vulnerabilities,\nBotBanishClient will modify the .htaccess file with a \"deny from\" entry so that the \"user\" cannot attack the system from that IP Address again.\nBecause some IP Addresses are dynamic; this dynamic approach which can lead to legitimate users being blocked from the system,\nso it is wise to make known a way of contacting your administrator to unblock an IP Address if a bad BOT\/USER changes their IP address\nand a legitimate users gets the blocked IP Address. In this case the administrator of the hosted site will need to remove the IP address\nfrom the .htaccess file and it should also be deleted from the BotBanishClient database table (BotBanishClient_ip). To keep an IP Address\nfrom being blocked in the future the IP should be added to the BotBanishClient_ip_dnb table.\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Uses:<\/p>\n<pre><code>BotBanishClient will automatically log and terminate BOTs that are determined fake users.\nBotBanishClient will monitor them until BotBanishClient determines that they should not have access to your system.\nThe termination process makes it easier for WordPress; so that WordPress will not have to use up resources to defend against frequent BOT attacks.\n\nPlease remove this line if found in your .htaccess file. It will interfere with user agent processing:\n\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^(.+)$\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Analytics:<\/p>\n<pre><code>BotBanish collects information about which pages guests visit and which files get downloaded from your site.\nYou can see these analytics in the BotBanish Firewall Settings Section of WordPress.\nBest analytic results when used with SEO URLs.\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Limitations:<\/p>\n<pre><code>Designed for use on PHP, mySQL &amp; Apache ONLY.\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Languages:<\/p>\n<pre><code>BotBanish currently supports the following languages:\n\nEnglish\nFrench\nGerman\nItalian\nPortuguese\nSpanish\nSwedish\n<\/code><\/pre>\n","installation":"<p>Installation Instructions:<\/p>\n<pre><code>Upload the BotBanish.zip file to the WordPress Plugins folder was installed or use the WordPress \"Add Plugin\" menu selection to upload the Botbanish.zip file.\nSettings can be changed on the BotBanish Firewall Client Settings Page\n\nBotBanish Website: https:\/\/botbanish.com\nBotBanish Support: https:\/\/randemsystems.com\/support\/index.php#c18\nRelease History: https:\/\/randemsystems.com\/support\/botbanish-release-history\/\n<\/code><\/pre>\n","faq":"<p>None<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>3.0.00 &#8211; 2018-02-05<\/h4>\n<h4>3.2.06 &#8211; 2019-04-13<\/h4>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/botbanish-firewall-client.4.1.04.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"bot-banish":"bot banish","bot-defense":"bot defense","bot-spam":"bot spam","botbanish":"botbanish","spammer-bot":"spammer bot"},"versions":{"4.1.04":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/botbanish-firewall-client.4.1.04.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/botbanish-firewall-client.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/blaxtonjames.com\/Payments\/Randem_Systems_Online_Payments","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/botbanish-firewall-client\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2932581","high":false}}
