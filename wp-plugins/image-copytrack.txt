Copytrack finds them and their lawyers try to get compensation. That part is great. \n\nThis integration with Wordpress, though, it especially awesome, and it's probably the only reason that I started regularly using copytrack to begin with. It's quick and easy to use (just submit photos to copytrack via your wordpress media library with the click of a button), and Copytrack does the rest. \n\nAt the moment, this plugin isn't actually working for me... I just get a PHP error, but I'll track that down and see if it's a problem with my server or the plugin. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Copytrack is an excellent service<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tigroumeow\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d21b79989071bd6ed38a9f11f9cd5a76?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d21b79989071bd6ed38a9f11f9cd5a76?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tigroumeow\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Jordy Meow <small>(TigrouMeow)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 2, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">My photos have been stolen many times on the web.
