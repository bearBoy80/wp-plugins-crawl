Just install the plugin, register at https:\/\/lector.paradimage.es and start selling.<\/p>\n<p>Very much like Amazon Kindle or iTunes, when your customers buy digital goods at your shop, the contents become available at the Paradimage Reader app (https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.paradimage.reader). The reader is a free app for Android equipped with DRM protection, that is, the customers cannot download or copy your media. We will charge you an extremely reduced fee for the use of the Reader by your customers (less than 0,50 USD per customer, one-off). Check our Terms of Use at https:\/\/lector.paradimage.es\/privacy-policy\/<\/p>\n<p>The Reader is designed to provide access to all the shops installing the plugin, so that the user experiences all the media in one place. Your shop will be highly visible for your customers: the logo, description and access to the catalog will be boldly shown in the main screen.<\/p>\n<p>To protect your media, the Reader uses PGP encryption, a combination of AES-128, RSA-256 and RSA-2048. Check all the security features at https:\/\/lector.paradimage.es. Regarding privacy, we will not host or have access to your media files. We will not handle sensitive data like your customers passwords.<\/p>\n<h3>Additional Documentation<\/h3>\n<p>You can find more information about Simple DRM&#8221; plugin at <a href=\"https:\/\/lector.paradimage.es\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this page<\/a><\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Installation procedure:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/simple-drm<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress.
