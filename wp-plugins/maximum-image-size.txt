But, when you solicit images from many sources, you may not be able to rely on users to size images to your specifications.  Here&#8217;s a very simple plugin that removes the full resolution image and replaces it with an image resized to your preference.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin makes no changes to your database and is written with just 17 lines of code.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>1) From with in the WordPress Admin Panel, Navigate to Plugins &gt;&gt; Add New &gt;&gt; Upload Plugin.  Upload the zip file (which you probably found this file in).<\/p>\n<p>2) Activate the plugin.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin has no configuration.  It works based on the Large image size, a configuration option which already exists in the WordPress core.  You may configure this by navigating to Settings &gt;&gt; Media.<\/p>\n<p>Tip: If you do not wish to retain a Medium image, set both Max Width and Max Height to 0.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Nice Plugin, It does exactly what it says it does.<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/wpbaxter\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f1a8eb4a61c4d8a685cf7ae9239d2e52?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f1a8eb4a61c4d8a685cf7ae9239d2e52?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/wpbaxter\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">wpbaxter<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 2, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">It does exactly what it says it does, but it keeps the original images on the server, can you please give me lines of code to add to this plugin that will automatically delete the original sized files from server and keep just the processed ones? i.e. large, medium and thumbnail<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/maximum-image-size.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"images":"images","media":"media"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"http:\/\/toao.net\/623","banners":[]}
