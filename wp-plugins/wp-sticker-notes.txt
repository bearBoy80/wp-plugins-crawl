Why?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin uses jQuery library and jQuery UI. In some situations there are multiple jQuery libraries included in document footer and head. In most cases this problem appears when there is jQuery included after jQuery UI. Check if there is jQuery included after jQuery UI.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Note is not in exact location where I sticked it.<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This happens when website is with responsive design and  you are viewing notes in non desktop version.

We use it to put review comments throughout a site, to communicate review points and feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Was working fine in 2015, then just recently (Feb 2016) it stopped working! I recently did all updates... to WordPress 4.4.2, to current \"X Theme\" and all associated plugins. When clicking the \"WP Sticky Notes\" tab in the left sidebar of admin interface, I was getting a fatal error due to this line in plugin.php:<br \/>\n    require_once( __DIR__ . \"\/pages\/admin_main.php\" );<br \/>\nAlthough it's probably not the best fix, I used a similar line from later in the file, and repaired this include of admin_main.php like this:<br \/>\n    require_once( ABSPATH . \"\/wp-content\/plugins\/wp-sticker-notes\" . \"\/pages\/admin_main.php\" );<\/p>\n<p>Now the plugin works again! Don't know what the problem was. Maybe even a hiccup in my hosting, rather than a problem with recent WordPress and theme updates?<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, for now, I'm back in business, and using these sticky notes for my site review process again. :-)\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-sticker-notes.2.1.5.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-sticker-notes\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=865705","caption":"Note on front page"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-sticker-notes\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=884437","caption":"Tagging users to note"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-sticker-notes\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=865705","caption":"Sticky Note"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-sticker-notes\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=870280","caption":"Admin settings page"}},"tags":{"notes":"notes","sticker":"Sticker","sticky":"sticky"},"versions":{"1.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-sticker-notes.1.0.5.zip","1.0.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-sticker-notes.1.0.8.zip","1.5.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-sticker-notes.1.5.0.zip","1.5.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-sticker-notes.1.5.1.zip","1.5.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-sticker-notes.1.5.2.zip","2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-sticker-notes.2.0.zip","2.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-sticker-notes.2.0.1.zip","2.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-sticker-notes.2.0.4.zip","2.1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-sticker-notes.2.1.4.zip","2.1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-sticker-notes.2.1.5.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-sticker-notes.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/sticker-notes.com\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-sticker-notes\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=861626","high":false}}
