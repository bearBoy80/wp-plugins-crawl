Basically post and pages.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is my wordpress going to be slower when using this plugin<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. There are no SQL queries or big processing. Just a small code that adapt the html output and adds a small javascript and css.<br \/>\nIt only includes javascript and css when needed (When there is a slider in the current post). The code is only<br \/>\nexecuted when you use a shortcode, so your other posts that doesn&#8217;t include a slider will not be affected in any way.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What wordpress versions are supported<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We started developing the plugin with wordpress 4.4, but almost any version that can handle shorcodes should work.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is this plugin easy to use?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely yes. Just use a shortcode in your post or pages. No admin, no configuration<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I customize the look and feel or functionalities?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You could add some css code to your theme for visual customizations.<br \/>\nAsk for any functionality in the support section. Probably, the future<br \/>\nof the plugin will be to extend some functionalities demanded by users.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding screenshots and some small fixes in text.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First commit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Fantastic<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pgleave\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/5e6e1c016e2f177d1fcb4a7296ad451d?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/5e6e1c016e2f177d1fcb4a7296ad451d?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pgleave\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">PGleave<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 17, 2019<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Works brilliantly and very easy to use<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/juxtapose-images.1.0.1.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"carousel":"carousel","image":"image","juxtapose":"juxtapose","shortcode":"shortcode","slider":"slider"},"versions":{"1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/juxtapose-images.1.0.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/juxtapose-images.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/juxtapose-images\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=1319675","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/juxtapose-images\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=1319675"}}
