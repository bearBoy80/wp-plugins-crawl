After that you can connect to it and receive support.<\/p>\n<p>To obtain support for some products a developer may require a product license. You must be prepared to provide it.<\/p>\n<h3>Main features<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Receiving support for all purchased products in one place &#8211; on your website<\/li>\n<li>Absolutelly free<\/li>\n<li>Simplicity and ease of use<\/li>\n<li>Automatic search for products providing support via Ticketrilla<\/li>\n<li>Duplication of tickets on your server. You can view tickets even when the developer server is disconnected<\/li>\n<li>Full security of file transfer, including executable code<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Ticketrilla does not provide support and is not responsible for its provision. It only provides the opportunity to receive it without leaving the site.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the &#8216;Ticketrilla: Client&#8217; folder to the &#8216;\/wp-content\/plugins&#8217; directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin throught the &#8216;Plugin&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Then you need to connect to the developers&#8217; servers that provide support through Ticketrilla. To do this, select the menu &#8220;Ticketrilla&#8221;. In the list of &#8220;available products&#8221; you will see the products that are installed on your server and for which support is available.<br \/>\nIf the product list is empty then you can ask the developers to begin to the support through Ticketrilla. And perhaps you will be able to receive support without leaving your site in the near future!<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='why%20list%20of%20supported%20products%20is%20empty%3F'>\nWhy list of supported products is empty?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>None of the products installed on your server provide support through Ticketrilla.<br \/>\nYou can write a request to support of the most necessary products to begin providing support through Ticketrilla.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20the%20developer%20turns%20off%20his%20support%20server%3F%3F'>\nWhat happens if the developer turns off his support server??\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>All correspondence is duplicated to your server. Therefore, you will be able to view the tickets and responses that you received before.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20to%20send%20files%20throught%20ticketrilla%3F'>\nCan I to send files throught Ticketrilla?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Any files transfer is protected. Even if you received from the developer a file with executable code, for example .php, then do not worry about server security. Immediately run the transferred files is impossible. First you must download the file to your computer and publish it on the server only after checking.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added notifications for new events (for example, your get a new response from developer)<\/li>\n<li>Added Newsletters<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Usability improvement<\/li>\n<li>Fixed minor bugs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new function for registering of temporary user in one click<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new function for sending server information in one click<\/li>\n<li>Fixed minor bugs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved security<\/li>\n<li>Fixed minor bugs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug which removing tags from tickets<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Release Date &#8211; 21 January 2019<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ticketrilla\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2387079\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ticketrilla\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2387079\" alt=\"The main page.
