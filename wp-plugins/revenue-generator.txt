Our flexible paywall enables you to request contributions from your followers or sell individual pieces of content, timed access, or recurring subscriptions to your site.<\/p>\n<p>Our unique \u2018pay later\u2019 model takes the upfront friction out of the transaction and allows your users to access content instantly by agreeing to pay for it later.<\/p>\n<p>You can offer content priced as low as $0.05 and audiences can purchase that content with just a click or two \u2013 without having to provide payment until they reach a $5 threshold on their tab. At this point, we ask them to pay and have found that about 85% of users will do so.<\/p>\n<p>Although we recommend using the \u2018pay later\u2019 model of the paywall because of the results mentioned above, you are, of course, free to choose the \u2018pay now\u2019 model if it better suits your needs. <a
