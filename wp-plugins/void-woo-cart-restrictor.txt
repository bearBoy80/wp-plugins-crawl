If the following 2 things are added, this plugin will deserve 5 stars, hands down !\n\n1. When a user is been restricted from buying from a certain category, and is logged in with credentials that are blocked from buying from that specific category, the message says, \"you must be logged in to purchase\". Well, in reality the user is already signed in. The generic message should be \"you must be logged in with the correct credentials to purchase the item\". This is just wording, it should take a few seconds to edit the wording.\n\n2. The second suggestion, is probably some simple CSS settings that need to be applied, and can be out of the box, or be added to the settings screen. When an item is restricted from purchase, always the price and the different variations are shown. In many cases, I'm guessing especially with wholesale prices, these would preferably not be publicly shown. In this case, only wholesalers should be able to see the prices, and maybe even the variations. At least the few wholesaler clients that I have, all of them don't want to display their wholesale prices publicly.\n\nThanks, great plugin nevertheless, looking forward to implement my suggestions, and thus me giving this plugin 5 stars, what it actually deserves !<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/void-woo-cart-restrictor.1.0.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/void-woo-cart-restrictor\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2069857","caption":"\/assets\/screenshot-1.png"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/void-woo-cart-restrictor\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2069857","caption":"\/assets\/screenshot-2.png"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/void-woo-cart-restrictor\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2069857","caption":"\/assets\/screenshot-3.png"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/void-woo-cart-restrictor\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2069857","caption":"\/assets\/screenshot-4.png"}},"tags":{"category":"category","product":"product","restrict":"restrict","visbility":"visbility","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/void-woo-cart-restrictor.1.0.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/void-woo-cart-restrictor.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.paypal.me\/voidcoder","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/void-woo-cart-restrictor\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2069857","high":false}}
