I Agree! has only been tested up to WordPress 4.5.9 and there is a strong chance it may not be compatible with newer releases. If you are using WordPress 4.6 or later, please be advised that this plugin is likely not to work with your site. Thank you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>I Agree! Popups<\/strong> is an easy-to-use WordPress plugin that allows the creation of Terms &amp; Conditions or Disclaimer popup windows for your site.<\/p>\n<p>You can create a single popup to appear across your entire site, assign it to specific posts and pages, or even have multiple popups for use on whichever posts and pages you choose.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I Agree! Popups<\/strong> is ideal for financial services, insurance and legal websites where visitors are required to agree to terms and conditions before accessing material.<\/p>\n<p>If a visitor agrees to the terms or acknowledges a disclaimer, <strong>I Agree! Popups<\/strong> stores a single, non-intrusive cookie in their browser to remember them for a time period specified by you. If they disagree, the visitor will be redirected to a URL of your choice.<\/p>\n<p>The popups you create can be easily styled to fit with your current theme and are fully responsive, playing nicely with devices of all shapes and sizes.<\/p>\n<p>Plugin setup is minimal and <strong>I Agree! Popups<\/strong> requires no knowledge of HTML or CSS. It couldn&#8217;t be simpler.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>For safety, we recommend you make a backup of your WordPress installation before using this plugin<\/li>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/plugin-name<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Click on the new menu item \u201cI Agree!

What does I Agree! Popups do?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. I Agree! allows for the creation of Terms and Conditions or Disclaimer popups for use on your WordPress site. You have the option to assign these popups to individual posts and pages, or choose a single one to appear &#8216;Sitewide&#8217;. If a user arrives at an area of your site where one of these popups is active, they will be required to acknowledge the popup and \u2018agree\u2019 to the content before they can continue.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Q. How customisable are the popups?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. We wanted to keep I Agree! as easy-to-use as possible, so all of the customisation options are available when creating and editing a popup. The customisable attributes include the transparent background layer colour, popup background colour, button background and text colours, the default &#8216;Agree&#8217; and &#8216;Disagree&#8217; button text, the &#8216;Disagree&#8217; redirect URL, and how long a visitor is remembered in their browser once they have acknowledged the popup\u2019s content.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Q. Are the popups responsive?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Yes. Popups created with I Agree! are fully responsive and designed to play nicely with devices of all shapes and sizes.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Q. Does I Agree! remember a visitors choice the next time they visit?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Yes. If a visitor agrees to the terms or acknowledges a disclaimer, I Agree! stores a single, non-intrusive cookie in their browser to remember them for a time period specified by you. If they disagree, the visitor will be redirected to a URL of your choice.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Q. Can I have more than one popup active at a time?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Yes, within reason:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are planning to use your popup(s) on individual posts and pages, you can have as many active as you like and assign them to whichever posts\/pages you choose. However, a single post\/page can only have one popup assigned to it at a time.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If you choose for a popup to appear &#8216;Sitewide&#8217;, this will take ultimate priority and override all the others. You can still create, edit and save as many as you like, but to use them on the site you will first need to disable the overriding popup by unchecking the &#8216;Sitewide&#8217; box and updating.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Q. Can I assign one popup to multiple posts and pages?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Yes, as many as you like!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Q. Does this plugin require jQuery?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Yes, this plugin relies on jQuery. If the theme you&#8217;re using has been configured correctly, WordPress will include jQuery automatically.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Q. What happens if a user has JavaScript disabled in their browser?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. The popups created with this plugin will not display without JavaScript enabled. However, all modern browsers have JavaScript enabled by default and just 2.4% of all web users browse without it. Unfortunately, this out of our (and your) hands.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/i-agree-popups\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1696274\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/i-agree-popups\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1696274\" alt=\"I Agree!
