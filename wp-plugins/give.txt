If you want a &#8220;Donate Now!&#8221; button in the header of your site that opens in a modal, you&#8217;ll most often have to do quite a bit of customization to get that working just right with form plugins &#8212; but not with GiveWP.<\/p>\n<p>GiveWP works great alongside all the most popular form plugins. Use GiveWP for donations, and Caldera Forms, Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms or other for your general purpose intake forms. They&#8217;ll work great alongside each other.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20givewp%20better%20than%20an%20ecommerce%20plugin%20for%20accepting%20donations%20on%20wordpress%3F'>\nHow is GiveWP better than an eCommerce plugin for accepting donations on WordPress?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We built GiveWP specifically to overcome many of the hurdles you have to go through in order to get an eCommerce plugin (like WooCommerce) to be streamlined for donations. You want to treat your donors right. No donor wants to add their donation to a cart and go through several page refreshes just to type in their information. You, as the site admin, don\u2019t want to have to change the word \u201cProducts\u201d to \u201cDonations\u201d everywhere, and go through all the hoops of removing taxes and shipping, either.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, customizing the plugin\u2019s terminology is a daunting task. You never want your users to receive an \u201cinvoice\u201d for the donation \u201cproduct\u201d they \u201cpurchased.\u201d Rather, you\u2019d like for them to receive a receipt for the donation they gave.<\/p>\n<p>Use GiveWP for donations, and let your WooCommerce or WP eCommerce plugin or the like handle your products. They work alongside each other just fine. Your donors will be happy, your customers will be happy, and so will you.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you can use our <a href=\"https:\/\/go.givewp.com\/addon-upsells\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Donation Upsells for WooCommerce<\/a> GiveWP add-on to allow your customers to do a donation upsell in the cart or checkout.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20eliminated%20the%202%25%20fee%20on%20stripe%20donations%3F'>\nHow do I eliminated the 2% fee on Stripe donations?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The 2% fee on Stripe donations only applies to donations taken via our free Stripe integration in GiveWP Core. If you purchase the premium Stripe add-on you will not have any additional fees at all. Additionally, even with the free Stripe plugin, the fees only apply to one-time donations, never to recurring donations.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/go.givewp.com\/version2-5\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read our release announcement<\/a> for all the details, and if you have further questions feel free to reach out via <a href=\"https:\/\/go.givewp.com\/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our contact page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>3.2.1: Dec 13th, 2023<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Resolved an issue that was duplicating the &#8220;Donate Now&#8221; button on legacy form template<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Resolved an issue that was preventing display options from being reflected on the form<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Removed an error notice that was showing up on admin menu pages<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Resolved an error in the donation form block when the admin page is refreshed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.2.0: Dec 6th, 2023<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New: Embed form button added to the Visual Donation Form Builder<\/li>\n<li>New: Pre-publish confirmation panel added to the Visual Donation Form Builder<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Updated parts of the Form Builder text areas to Text Editors to provide more formatting options<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Improved compatibility with the donation block and Visual Builder forms<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: All donors are connected with a user for improved security and caching compatibility<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Improve the Name, and Terms and Conditions blocks with global settings<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Resolved some strange behaviors when using the Amount Levels setting in the Form Builder<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Removed WP_Background_Process and WP_Async_Request to avoid conflicts with other plugins<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Donor honorific (Mr, Mrs, etc) is now properly saved as part of the donor record<\/li>\n<li>Fix: PayPal Donations displays a helpful error message when incorrect credit card information is entered<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Visual Donation Form Builder loading is improved by preventing the formBuilderSettings meta from becoming too large<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Resolved an issue where some donations list tables were failing to load due to missing donation mode meta<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Resolved an issue where the donation forms list tables were resulting in duplicate forms<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Resolved an issue where PayPal smart buttons were not being displayed on embedded forms using legacy template<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Resolved an issue with PayPal donations and fee recovery where the fee was not being added to the donation total<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.1.1: November 3rd, 2023<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Embedded forms created with the Visual Builder now redirect to the confirmation page after a completed donation.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Donor title prefixes are now formatted as strings (like Mr or Ms) instead of numbers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.1.0: October 25th, 2023<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Feature: Design Mode changes in the Form Builder are now instant and awesome!

If you are using another plugin that uses Stripe to accept payments there is a chance that it may include the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/stripe\/stripe-php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stripe SDK<\/a> (Software Development Kit) either through <a href=\"http:\/\/getcomposer.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Composer<\/a> or manually initialized. This can cause conflicts with GiveWP because WordPress does not have a dependency management system to prevent conflicts and the other plugins may be using outdated versions compared to GiveWP&#8217;s. To help resolve conflicts we have included two options to use Stripe alongside these other plugins. The recommended way is Composer, but if that is not working then we recommend manual initialized.

This kind of works for GiftAid, but means that you have to make the billing address mandatory for all donors - whereas it's neater just to be able to take credit card details (without billing address) for speedy donations. <br \/><br \/>Finally, the GiftAid submission process needs house name or number and postcode as the minimum  collected data - but GiveWP cannot separate House name\/number and Street name. <br \/><br \/>Until this functionality is added, we cannot process GiftAid using this plugin. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Fast and competent support.<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/andi22\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9053bb357da118a40d8b2fa3c999d5b9?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9053bb357da118a40d8b2fa3c999d5b9?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/andi22\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">andi22<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 15, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Fast and competent support.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Free version not really usable<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"2 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"2\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mballew\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/94a869be170675a8d6f52badc9fbe51d?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/94a869be170675a8d6f52badc9fbe51d?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mballew\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">mballew<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 8, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Was looking for a simple way to make donations via SquareUp, but what good is a free plugin for payments if you can't make payments with the free version.
