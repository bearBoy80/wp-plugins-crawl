The markdown version is stored separately (in the <code>post_content_formatted<\/code> column), so you can deactivate this plugin and your posts won&#8217;t spew out Markdown, because HTML is stored in the <code>post_content<\/code>, just like normal. This is also much faster than doing on-the-fly Markdown conversion on every page load. It&#8217;s only done once! When you re-edit the post, the markdown version is swapped into the editor for you to edit. If something external updates the post content, you&#8217;ll lose the Markdown version.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Upload the <code>markdown-on-save<\/code> folder to your <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate the &#8220;Markdown On Save&#8221; plugin in your WordPress administration interface<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a new post with Markdown, and check the &#8220;This post is formatted with Markdown&#8221; box.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Done!
