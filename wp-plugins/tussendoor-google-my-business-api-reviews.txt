When the plugin has access to the API, the plugin inserts structured data into the footer of the website. This results in a rating in the Google search results.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin also allows you to display your rating with a standard widget or shortcode. You can use this anywhere in your theme or builder.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Extra features for Premium users:<\/strong><br \/>\n* A variety of default shortcodes that give you the flexibility to show the rating in the way you want.<br \/>\n* Functionality to create your own widget!<br \/>\n* Functionality to style your own or our default widget \/ shortcodes.<br \/>\n* Interact with the reviews.
