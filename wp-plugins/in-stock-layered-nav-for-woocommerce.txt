This could result in a frustrating customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>Example: Consider Product A. Product A comes in sizes 1, 2, &amp; 3. However, size 2 is currently out of stock. If I filter the catalogue using WooCommerce Layered Nav widget, I will see Product A listed under size 2, even though it is out of stock. This would remove Product A from the size 2 page until it is restocked.<\/p>\n<p>A few notes about the plugin:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce is of course required.<\/li>\n<li>This will only work for attributes used in variations.<\/li>\n<li>The attributes need to be taxonomies, and not defined on the product level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>I am not seeing out of stock products removed from attribute catalog pages.<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The attribute &amp; options need to be set up as an [attribute taxonomy in WooCommerce](https:\/\/docs.woothemes.com\/document\/managing-product-taxonomies\/#adding-attributes-to-your-store \u201cAdding Attributes to your Store\u201d).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Will this plugin cause any performance issues?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Even though the best efforts have been made to minimize any performance impacts, this plugin does perform some potentially heavy additional queries to filter out itms not in stock.
