But the plugin author does not respond to your submission offer or you cannot contact the author for whatever reasons.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, you may be able to upload the file in the location that the plugin uses within the plugin&#8217;s directory but this is not ideal because when it is updated, your translation file will be gone. You have to repeat doing it.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin solves this problem by allowing you to upload the mo file and lets WordPress use it.<\/p>\n<p>What you need are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>mo file (the translation file with a text domain prefix)<\/li>\n<li>text domain (usually the plugin\/theme slug)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Set these in the setting page and the plugin will take care of the rest.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s simple and lightweight.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <strong><code>custom-translation-files.php<\/code><\/strong> and other files compressed in the zip folder to the <strong><code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code><\/strong> directory.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Go to <strong>Dashboard<\/strong> -&gt; <strong>Settings<\/strong> -&gt; <strong>Custom Translation Files<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Add your items there.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.0 &#8211; 11\/01\/2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Released initially.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/custom-translation-files\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1966610\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/custom-translation-files\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1966610\" alt=\"&lt;strong&gt;Setting Page&lt;\/strong&gt;\"><\/a><p><strong>Setting Page<\/strong><\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/custom-translation-files.1.0.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/custom-translation-files\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1966610","caption":"<strong>Setting Page<\/strong>"}},"tags":{"localization":"localization","mo":"mo","text-domain":"text domain","translate":"translate","translation":"translation"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/custom-translation-files.1.0.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/custom-translation-files.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/en.michaeluno.jp\/donate","banners":[]}
