With the new capacity engine, you can define booking capacities for your calendar, allowing you to receive a <strong>specific number of bookings per time slots or full dates<\/strong>. This enhances your control over bookings compared to the previous version, which only supported specific booking limits for full dates. <em>(Business Large, MultiUser)<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Booking Quantity Control:<\/strong> Enabled the ability to enable and define a field for &#8216;Booking Quantity Control,&#8217; allowing visitors to define the number of items they can book for specific dates or times within a single reservation.

For defining capacity, use child booking resources. For defining max visitors selection, use a new custom booking form with a different number of users\/visitors selection. <em>(Business Medium\/Large, MultiUser)<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Unavailable Time Definition Engine:<\/strong> Introduced an engine for defining an unavailable specific number of dates or specific times before or after the booking. It now works in all situations, even for fully booked dates. For bookings where you have selected several dates and booked specific times, the system will extend the unavailable time interval for all such time slots on each day. <em>(Business Medium\/Large, MultiUser)<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Booking Details Tooltip:<\/strong> Added the ability to show booking details in a mouse-over tooltip for specific booked dates or times during a day, significantly improving the speed of this functionality. This can now show booking details even for fully booked dates. <em>(Business Medium\/Large, MultiUser)<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Simplified Booking Form Layout<\/strong>. Easily configure your <strong>booking form in rows and columns<\/strong> using new <strong>Simple HTML shortcodes<\/strong>. Create rows with <strong>&#8230;<\/strong>, columns with <strong>&#8230;<\/strong>, labels with <strong>&#8230;<\/strong> and spacer with  <strong><\/strong> or <strong>width:40px;<\/strong> or <strong>height:2em;<\/strong> . For example, to create a single row with two columns, use: <strong> &#8230; &#8230; <\/strong>. <em>(All Pro Versions)<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Simplified field data tag<\/strong>: <strong>&#8230;<\/strong>. Easily highlight field data by enclosing it within &#8230; tags in the &#8216;Content of booking fields data&#8217; section on the Booking &gt; Settings &gt; Form page. For example: [secondname]&lt;\/f.
