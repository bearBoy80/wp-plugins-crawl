This syntax is easy-to-learn and fast-to-type. The goal behind BlogText is that you don\u2019t need to write HTML anymore to achieve the desired text layout.<\/p>\n<p>The following list lists some of the markups supported by BlogText. For a more complete list, see <a href=\"http:\/\/blogtext.mayastudios.com\/syntax\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BlogText&#8217;s syntax description page<\/a> (which is written entirely in BlogText syntax and demonstrates BlogText&#8217;s capabilities).<\/p>\n<p>Supported markup:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic text formatting such as bold, italics, underlining, and strike-through<\/li>\n<li>Lists<\/li>\n<li>Tables<\/li>\n<li>Internal and external links<\/li>\n<li>Headings<\/li>\n<li>Table of contents<\/li>\n<li>Preformatted text and code blocks with syntax highlighting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>BlogText also integrates itself into <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/classic-editor\/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress&#8217; classic editor<\/a> (which is the recommended way to write BlogText) by providing its own buttons (to create BlogText syntax), media browser integration, and help links. This make writing posts with BlogText even easier.<\/p>\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"http:\/\/blogtext.mayastudios.com\/features\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BlogText&#8217;s feature list<\/a><\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Installing BlogText is pretty much straight forward.<\/p>\n<p>Simple way: <strong>Install via WordPress&#8217; plugin page.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Manual way:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Simply download the BlogText .zip file.<\/li>\n<li>Extract it.<\/li>\n<li>Upload the folder &#8220;blogtext&#8221; (containing the file <code>blogtext.php<\/code> among others) into your blog&#8217;s plugin directory (usually <code>wp-content\/plugins<\/code>).<\/li>\n<li>Activate it from the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; panel in your blog&#8217;s admin interface<\/li>\n<li>Start writing your posts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.9.10<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed some bugs (issues #29, #35, #36)<\/li>\n<li>Updated NPM packages to fix a security vulnerability<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Change: Removed all custom thumbnail creation code. Instead, BlogText now just uses the actual image &#8211; with appropriate <code>max-width<\/code> styling. For reasoning, see issue #22.<\/li>\n<li>Change: <code>{{!!<\/code> now preserves line breaks by disabling WordPress&#8217; auto-<code>&lt;p&gt;<\/code> functionality. <code>{{!<\/code> remains unchanged. (issue #19)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: The editor toolbar got slightly broken in a previous WordPress version. It&#8217;s now fixed again.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: The syntax highlighting language lookup window now has a proper width even in Chrome.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Quotes in Interlinks now work properly<\/li>\n<li>Fix: <code>%%<\/code> can now be used in code blocks (issue #21)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: A single <code>]<\/code> is now supported in shortcodes (issue #17)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Known Issue: Post previews don&#8217;t work with the new Gutenberg editor introduced in WordPress 5.0. (issue #3)<\/li>\n<li>Change: BlogText is now hosted as Git repo on GitHub. (Thus issue numbering will reset.)<\/li>\n<li>Change: Updated GeSHi to 1.0.9.0 (plus pull request #100 which fixes a deprecation warning).<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Replace instances of <code>mysql_query()<\/code> with <code>mysqli_query()<\/code> so that BlogText works on PHP 7. (issue #2)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Breaking change: BlogText now requires at least PHP 5.3!<\/li>\n<li>Feature: Added support for email addresses (plain text as well as interlink ones).<\/li>\n<li>Change: Exceptions thrown while converting a post from BlogText to HTML no longer stops the whole PHP script (i.e. content coming after the affected post is now rendered).<\/li>\n<li>Change: When a link to a page\/post couldn&#8217;t be created because the post status is not &#8216;published&#8217;, the post status will now be put in the link text. Before it would always say &#8220;[unpublished]&#8221; even if the post was trashed.<\/li>\n<li>Change\/Fix: Removed BlogText comments from the beginning of every post\/page as WordPress was creating an extra paragraph for them (although it shouldn&#8217;t).<\/li>\n<li>Change: Updated to GeSHi 1.0.8.12 (from 1.0.8.10). This new version adds some more languages for code blocks. See <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/GeSHi\/geshi-1.0\/blob\/d9cfd3e0cc9b24e6bd3045a4d222e651e68accd8\/src\/docs\/CHANGES\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">full changelog<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Change: The default BlogText CSS file (now called <code>blogtext-default.css<\/code>) is now minified.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: WordPress instances using BlogText can now be moved to different folders.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed code blocks with line numbers in Twenty Fifteen theme.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Change: link anchors in TOC links in list view are now prepended with &#8220;post-&#8221; to meet the (arguably ancient) HTML 4 requirement for ids (must not start with a digit).<\/li>\n<li>Change: Auto-generated anchor links now use dash (<code>-<\/code>) instead of underscores (<code>_<\/code>).<\/li>\n<li>Change: The icon for broken internal links can now be enabled or disabled as well.<\/li>\n<li>Change: Changed the style of how image captions are displayed. They no longer use a frame. Also added the CSS class &#8220;wp-post-image&#8221; to <code>&lt;img&gt;<\/code> elements.<\/li>\n<li>Change: Changed the headings permalink icon from the paragraph to infinity.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Nested lists (e.g. <code>**<\/code> in <code>*<\/code>) didn&#8217;t work when they were indented by a space.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Link icons are now displayed correctly even if BlogText&#8217;s default style sheet isn&#8217;t enable.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: BlogText&#8217;s settings link is displayed again in the plugin list.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Linking from a section above a more tag to a heading below the more tag no longer results in a &#8220;not found&#8221; link.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Captions for images now display correctly when the blog&#8217;s theme has <code>$content_width<\/code> defined.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: TOCs now display correctly again with WordPress 3.5&#8217;s default theme.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Highlighting code blocks now works for all built-in themes. Also the text coloring isn&#8217;t lost for the highlighted line.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.5.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed PHP parser error present only in PHP &lt; 5.4<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>BlogText now works with PHP 5.4.0 (did not work due to an error in BlogText&#8217;s option API).<\/li>\n<li>Removed all file type icons. Icons for links to external sites, attachments, and subsections in the same page remain. The icons have been replaced by a web-font though (making them scale with the font size). Additionally each icon type can now be disabled in BlogText&#8217;s settings.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Emphasis (<code>\/\/<\/code>) can now surround an external link.<\/li>\n<li>BlogText no longer creates thumbnails when the original image would work just fine.<\/li>\n<li>A double space in a heading no longer breaks the parser.<\/li>\n<li>Fix\/Change: If punctuation is written after a plain-text URL separated by one or more spaces, now the space will be removed only for certain punctuation. Especially, it won&#8217;t be removed anymore for opening brackets. To force BlogText to keep the spaces, simply use more than one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Syntax Change] To add indented text to an open list, its items now need to be indented by at least two spaces; previously only one space was necessary. This change was made to avoid accidental indention of content generated by other plug-ins (such as the more-link generated by WordPress itself).<\/li>\n<li>[Syntax Change] Ordered and unordered list item (e.g. <code>*<\/code>, <code>#<\/code>, <code>*#<\/code>, &#8230;) now need a space after them to be recognized. This change was introduced to work around a problem where the BlogText parser didn&#8217;t recognize the bold syntax at the beginning of a line.<\/li>\n<li>[Style Change] The TOC no longer uses <code>float: right<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Double hash code sections (<code>##<\/code>) now work, when they&#8217;re at the beginning of a line.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed code blocks with syntax highlighting: No more additional empty lines between code lines (only happen when syntax highlighting was used but line numbering wasn&#8217;t).<\/li>\n<li>Fixed thumbnails that weren&#8217;t displayed when PHP strict warning were enabled.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Bold text can now be at the beginning of a line, even if indented.<\/li>\n<li>Updated to newest GeSHi revision (svn: r2522, hg: b4dcf778dccf)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;cat:&#8221; is now allowed as alternative to the &#8220;category:&#8221; Interlink prefix<\/li>\n<li>Now runs with WordPress 3.3<\/li>\n<li>Fixed anchors to headings not working in multi post view and RSS feed.<\/li>\n<li>Anchor links (\u00b6) are no longer added to headings in the RSS feed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed line highlighting, if the code snippet doesn&#8217;t start off line one.<\/li>\n<li>Added BlogText settings to the admin bar<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Checked compatibility against WordPress 3.2<\/li>\n<li>Fixed problem where the id of an attachment could not be determined in some cases. In these cases the attachment would not display correctly.<\/li>\n<li>Fix image info: Now also recognizes Exif JPEG images<\/li>\n<li>Fixed error when updating a page that doesn&#8217;t use BlogText<\/li>\n<li>Added special (more natural) code block languages: C++, C++\/Qt, C++\/CLI, C#, Java (maps to java5)<\/li>\n<li>Added two new GeSHi themes with more complete coloring; the bright one is now the default one<\/li>\n<li>Added ability to highlight certain lines in code blocks<\/li>\n<li>The language lookup window has been improved: it can now be closed by pressing Escape or Return, has scrollbars, displays the language&#8217;s full name, and displays the most popular languages at the top.<\/li>\n<li>Updated GeSHI to the most recent SVN revision<\/li>\n<li>Added some regression tests to avoid\/reduce conversion errors when modifying BlogText&#8217;s sources. (only in developer version obtained from BitBucket)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed RSS rendering<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The cache can now be cleared again from the admin bar<\/li>\n<li>Custom heading ids now work again (they were broken in 0.9.1)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Absolute links (like <code>[[\/feed|my feed]]<\/code>) can now be used.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed image captions for external images; they no longer have a width of 0px.<\/li>\n<li>Added &#8220;big&#8221; for image size which is just an alias for &#8220;large&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Certain JPEG images (encoded with Progressive DCT) can now be used<\/li>\n<li>If an alt text is specified for an image, it&#8217;s now used as title as well (if no title has been specified separately). Previously the file name was chosen instead.<\/li>\n<li>Image titles will now be added as title attribute to the surround link, if there is any.<\/li>\n<li>Plain text URLs in lists are now correctly recognized<\/li>\n<li>Plain text URLs can now have a trailing fullstop, comma, semicolon, or colon without this being interpreted as part of the URL. Brackets still need to be &#8220;escaped&#8221; by a space.<\/li>\n<li>Added backticks for inline code snippets (as alternative to the <code>##<\/code> syntax).<\/li>\n<li>Slightly changed heading syntax. Now, an anchor id must be separated by a least one equal sign (<code>=<\/code>) from the heading text. This allows for hash signs in the headings text, eg. in &#8220;C# overview&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>The quote characters (<code>\"<\/code>) around attributes for <code>{{{ ... }}}<\/code> code blocks are now optional.<\/li>\n<li>Added button to the editor (called &#8220;lang lookup&#8221;) to lookup languages supported for syntax highlighting.<\/li>\n<li>The programming language can now also be specified by using the language&#8217;s file extension. You can do this with &#8220;.c&#8221; for example.<\/li>\n<li>Rewrote output cache<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.0d<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This version was just released to fix the buggy readme parser in the WordPress Plugin Directory.
