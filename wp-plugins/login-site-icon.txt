Rather than the WordPress mark, linked to WordPress.org, the site icon is used and linked to the site&#8217;s home page. The site icon is used rather than the logo theme feature because it is already a square image, and the login screen is designed to use a square image here. If you already have a site icon set up, this plugin will work automatically as soon as it&#8217;s activated.<\/p>\n<p>Re-branding the login screen slightly can reduce confusion for users that have (or use) multiple WordPress sites, as well as improving contributor understanding for sites with a large number of contributors. Note that site icons must be square and that their primary purpose is to be used as browser and device icons. However, this plugin provides a convenient way to make use of the icon in another context.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Take the easy route and install through the WordPress plugin installer, or,<\/li>\n<li>Download the .zip file and upload the unzipped folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>If you haven&#8217;t set up your site icon yet, go to Customize -&gt; Site Identity to do so<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20options%3F'>\nWhere are the options?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are no options. To change your site icon, go to the core &#8220;Site Identity&#8221; section in the Customizer.
