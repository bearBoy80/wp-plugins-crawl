This is really the system to use. It gives amazing data for you to be able to do things like track the effectiveness of CDN's (which is what I am using it for).\nThe one catch and why I've knocked a start off is that the Wordpress plugin offers a range of different Zoho datacentre locations. As far I know only the US one works. So long as you set that it should all be good and to be honest I can't see why reporting this data to the US would be a problem as it's still giving the user data as it refers to your website download.\nAnyway, great data. Use it if you want to really see what is happening at your customers devices.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/site24x7-rum.1.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/site24x7-rum\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2294141","caption":"End User Response Time Globally"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/site24x7-rum\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2294141","caption":"RUM Dashboard"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/site24x7-rum\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2294141","caption":"Javascripts errors"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/site24x7-rum\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2294141","caption":"Response Time by Device"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/site24x7-rum\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2294141","caption":"ISP summary."}},"tags":{"application-performance":"application performance","real-user-monitoring":"real user monitoring","rum":"rum","user-experience-monitoring":"user experience monitoring","website-monitoring":"website monitoring"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/site24x7-rum.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/site24x7-rum.1.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/site24x7-rum.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.site24x7.com\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/site24x7-rum\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2294141","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/site24x7-rum\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2294141"}}
