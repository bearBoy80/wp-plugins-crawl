This can be useful, for example, with events that have associated dates in the future. Such future posts can, with this plugin, be displayed, both individually and in archive lists. This plugin also adds functionality to the built-in calendar widget. It adds a checkbox to include future posts in the calendar, and it allows the calendar to be configured to show posts from a single category.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload &#8216;future.php&#8217; to the \/wp-content\/plugins\/ directory<\/li>\n<li>Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Admin area and click &#8216;Activate&#8217; for Future<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>How to show future\/scheduled posts?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>On your page call, add the get variable &#8216;future&#8217; and set this to true. For example: &#8220;http:\/\/example.com\/?cat=7&amp;future=true&#8221; or &#8220;http:\/\/example.com\/blog\/2013\/?future=true&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively (and easier in many cases), in the menu editor, select &#8220;Display only future posts&#8221; for any category pages in your menu structure.<\/p>\n<p>This displays all future posts in ascending order of date.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What if I want to display both past and future posts?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>On your page call, set the variable &#8216;future&#8217; to all. For example: &#8220;http:\/\/example.com\/?cat=7&amp;future=all&#8221; or &#8220;http:\/\/example.com\/blog\/2013\/?future=all&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively (and easier in many cases), in the menu editor, select &#8220;Display both past and future posts&#8221; for any category pages in your menu structure.<\/p>\n<p>This displays all posts (both published and scheduled) in descending order of date.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What if I want my WordPress calendar widget to display my future\/scheduled posts?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin modifies the WordPress calendar widget so it now has a checkbox to &#8220;Include Future Posts.&#8221; Simply check this box and the calendar will display all posts, including future\/scheduled posts.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I only want future posts from one category to show up in my calendar. How do I do this?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>With this plugin, the WordPress calendar widget also has a dropdown box to select a single category. You can select a category with or without checking the &#8220;Include Future Posts&#8221; option, and the calendar will limit the posts it shows to this category.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.2.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Addresses issues with editing menus in WordPress 4.0 *<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes an issue with duplicated link titles in the calendar *<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added compatibility with the WordPress core function &#8220;paginate_links&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug where the displayed calendar widget was reverting back to the WordPress default calendar widget<\/li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the controls in the menu editor were displaying on Page menu objects instead of Category menu objects<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed possible compatibility issues with new versions of WordPress (now tested up to version 3.9.1)<\/li>\n<li>Added controls to display future and all posts to WordPress&#8217;s built-in menu editor<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug where linked dates in the calendar widget do not have post titles as link titles.
