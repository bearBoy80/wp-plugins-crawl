The response is stored within the user profile metadata<\/li>\n<li>a shortcode [bluem_identificatieformulier] that allows (guest) users to perform an iDIN eID request and store this information within the user profile metadata for further usage in third-party plugins or functions within your theme.<\/li>\n<li>an extensive settings page that allows for enabling\/disabling and configuration of specific services<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Usage<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Be sure to enable the desired modules from the Bluem &gt; Settings page!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ensure that the required information is filled in within the settings page. The Access Token for testing, the SenderID and the brandID have to be set properly. These details are given by your Bluem account manager.<\/p>\n<p>You can change the environment from <code>Testing<\/code> to <code>Live (production)<\/code> as soon as you have a production token. Please ensure you have tested your configuration extensively.<\/p>\n<h3>Mandates<\/h3>\n<p>eMandates is utilized as a Payment Gateway within WooCommerce. Enable it as a module in Settings &gt; bluem and as the gateway in WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Payments<\/p>\n<p>From that moment onwards you can utilize the gateway during checkout.<\/p>\n<h3>Mandates shortcode<\/h3>\n<p>Activated if Mandates is activated as a module from the Settings &gt; Bluem page.<\/p>\n<p>Using this shortcode, it is possible to allow users to create a mandate separate from a WooCommerce context or usage. This can be used on the account information page to encourage people to already arrange this before proceeding on your site.<br \/>\nShortcode: <code>[bluem_machtigingsformulier]<\/code><\/p>\n<p>It is possible to programmatically block display and functionality on your site based on the presence of a mandate for a user. Please contact us if you are interested in developing this in your site.<\/p>\n<h3>Payments<\/h3>\n<p>ePayments is utilized as a Payment Gateway within WooCommerce. Enable it as a module in Settings &gt; bluem and as the gateway in WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Payments<\/p>\n<p>From that moment onwards you can utilize the gateway during checkout.<\/p>\n<h3>Identity<\/h3>\n<p>Available as automatic blocking for WooCommerce&#8217;s checkout procedure and as shortcode (see next section).<\/p>\n<p>If the user&#8217;s identity and\/or age is not yet verified, a prompt will be shown as soon as the user attempts to check out. In this prompt, a link to directly initiate the identification procedure will be present. As soon as the identification procedure has been completed successfully, the prompt will disappear and the checkout procedure can be followed. Any items in the cart will still be intact.<\/p>\n<p>In the settings interface you can enable a check for Identity verification and additional Age verification based on a specific given age. This can only be enabled or disabled shop-wide at this moment. Do note: It is possible to disable the automatic check and implement your own blocking check based on specific conditions. Please contact us for instructions on how to do this.<\/p>\n<h3>Identity Shortcode<\/h3>\n<p>Activated if iDIN  is activated as a module from the Settings &gt; Bluem page.<\/p>\n<p>Using this shortcode, it is possible to allow users to identify separate from WooCommerce and a shop context. This can be used on the account information page to encourage people to verify their identities.<br \/>\nShortcode: <code>[bluem_identificatieformulier]<\/code><\/p>\n<p>It is possible to programmatically block display and functionality on your site based on the verification status.
