Anyone who would like to take over the development can contact me in this regard. For an alternative plugin that does basically the same thing see: <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/google-bookshelves\/\" title=\"Google Bookshelves\" rel=\"ugc\">Google Bookshelves<\/a>, I cannot however guarentee that, that plugin will be without bugs.<\/p>\n<p>This is a simple wordpress plugin that allows you to showcase your Google Books bookshelves. It uses the Google Books API, and can show any of the default shelves: Reading Now, Favorites, Have Read or To Read as well as custom shelves. You can also choose the maximum number of books that you want to display.<\/p>\n<p>I used some of the code from ZeroCool51&#8217;s (<a href=\"http:\/\/bostjan.gets-it.net\" title=\"Bostjan Cigan\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Bostjan Cigan<\/a>) plugin <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/currently-reading-book\/\" title=\"Currently Reading Book\" rel=\"ugc\">Currently Reading Book<\/a> for the admin area and <a href=\"http:\/\/adamwadeharris.com\" title=\"aharris88\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">aharris88<\/a>&#8216;s plugin <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/google-bookshelves\/\" title=\"Google Bookshelves\" rel=\"ugc\">Google Bookshelves<\/a> for the widget.
