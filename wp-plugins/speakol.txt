It was designed as a free, democratic and open platform that facilitated healthy and critical political debates and discussions around socio-political conditions within the country.<\/p>\n<p>With a 400k+ strong user base, the name change and relaunch corresponds to Speakol\u2019s vision of going global.<\/p>\n<p>Our priorities are to provide a unique service to media content publishers and brands in the form of three plugins: Debates (debate between two presented sides to a story), Argument Boxes (voting up or down on a topic) and Comparisons (discussion based on up to four options on any topic).

I have tried, over the course of many days, to try to create an account on speakol to get this id.  Every time I fill out the registration form and hit submit, I get an error saying \"array\".  I have tried to contact speakol through their \"contact us\" form, but, every time I submit the form it navigates me to a blank screen and never submits.  Since this has been a problem that has been lasting for days, I believe that this is very indicative of Speakol's attention to this app and their associated support for it.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/speakol.1.4.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/speakol\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1162602","caption":"The Argument Box settings."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/speakol\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1162602","caption":"The Argument Box widget at post or page."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/speakol\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1298998","caption":"The Argument Box at the post."}},"tags":[],"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/speakol.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/speakol.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/speakol.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/speakol.1.3.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/speakol.1.4.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/speakol.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/speakol\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1157219","high":false}}
