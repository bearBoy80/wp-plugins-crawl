Delete.<\/p>\n<p>Great plug-in! I have not finished yet, I had to stop and review anyway.  <em>First, it does work on 4.5.2.<\/em>  For me so far.  I have a MultiSite, tons of plug-ins including page builders, and I have had no issues.<\/p>\n<p>The thing is loaded with features. But the interface in clean, intuitive, and very well-organized.  And fast, doesn't drag or hang.  Using layers is quick, easy, and simple.  I'm not WP, design, or code literate.  It is as simple or as complex as you prefer.  The workflow is smooth - after dealing with other sliders today, this has actually been an enjoyable experience.  With very little effort, not changing defaults, I created something that is quite slick.  I simply added images and some text in a few minutes. <\/p>\n<p>There are demo templates you can import, via an XML, from their site for epic results.  These provide a better view of advanced use than reading through instructions and videos.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you so very much for your hard work to create, share, and maintain, an awesome plug-in.  And especially for free. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>I encourage 5-star reviewers to donate.<br \/>\nI encourage poor reviewers to go to their site and email the dev.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/neat-slider.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/neat-slider\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=968495","caption":"The Neat Slider interface."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/neat-slider\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=968495","caption":"Working Demo"}},"tags":{"best-slider-plugin":"best slider plugin","carousel":"carousel","responsive":"responsive","slider":"slider","slideshow":"slideshow"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/neat-slider\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=968656","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/neat-slider\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=968656"}}
