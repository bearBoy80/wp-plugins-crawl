It also offers the required field and unique field verification features. It powers you to add fully customizable AJAX powered responsive signup and login form for your website.<\/p>\n<p>LAZY SIGN-IN lets you create custom sign-up and login form with a single installation. You can easily create sign-up and login page using the shortcode [kwt_ajax_signup_form] and [kwt_ajax_login_form]. It also lets you add the custom fields in the sign-up form. You can add n number of sign-up fields and redirect users to specific page after sign-up from the back-end.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin also auto-generates the username and password for the users who signup. What you have to do is just tick mark the \u2018Auto-generate username\u2019 and \u2018Auto generate password\u2019 boxes in the signup setting in the backend. It generates fully responsive sign-up page that uses AJAX.<\/p>\n<p>You can add as many fields as you want in the signup form from the plugin settings. The best feature of the plugin is that you can keep the form fields \u2018required\u2019 as well as \u2018unique\u2019. Having \u2018unique form fields\u2019 is the biggest advantage of LAZY SIGN-IN plugin. Users can also modify the information they have provided while registering from User Meta Information in the profile page. What they need to do is update the information and save it. The system will automatically update the information in the database and consider the latest info from the next interaction.<\/p>\n<p>You can also assign a specific role from the backend to the users who sign-up. Users will also be able to change their profile information after signing up.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Plugin Features<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy installation<\/li>\n<li>Separate login and signup pages<\/li>\n<li>Easy customization of login and signup forms<\/li>\n<li>Ability for add\/remove fields in the signup form<\/li>\n<li>Ability to redirect users to specific page<\/li>\n<li>Can keep the form fields &#8216;required\u2019 and \u2018unique\u2019<\/li>\n<li>Ability to assign roles to the users<\/li>\n<li>AJAX verification<\/li>\n<li>Free support<\/li>\n<li>Multi-lingual support<\/li>\n<li>Translation ready (Gujarati, Hindi)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>PRO Plugin Features<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customizable login form<\/li>\n<li>Link to Sign up page in login form<\/li>\n<li>Terms and condition checkbox<\/li>\n<li>CSS and JS inclusion on the shortcode applied pages only<\/li>\n<li>Minified CSS and JS to improved page speed<\/li>\n<li>Action hook on the successful registration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h4>Buy Lazy Sign-in Pro on Codecanyon :<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/store.krishaweb.com\/product\/lazy-sign-in-pro-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/store.krishaweb.com\/product\/lazy-sign-in-pro-wordpress-plugin<\/a><\/p>\n","installation":"<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.<\/p>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the plugin via WordPress or download and upload the plugin to the \/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Use the shortcode [kwt_ajx_login_form] or [kwt_ajax_signup_form].<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='how%20to%20redirect%20users%20to%20a%20specific%20page%20after%20sign%20up%3F'>\nHow to redirect users to a specific page after sign up?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can add the specific destination page URL from the Lazy Signup settings.
