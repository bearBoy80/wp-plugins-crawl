Try, for example, [wp-meetup-calendar start_month=-2 end_month=2]. This will show a total of 4 months (2 previous months, and the next 2 months, all relative to the current month). Play around with it, it&#8217;s great to be able to have this variable calendar showing!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Note: With version 2.0.0, shortcodes were added, e.g. <code>[meetup-calendar]<\/code> by default displays only the current month. The ability to display multiple months still exists, e.g. <code>[meetup-calendar past=1 future=2]<\/code> will display 4 months (1 previous month, the current month, and the next 2 months).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Important: If you&#8217;re upgrading from a version prior to 1.2, make sure to disable the plugin and re-enable it.<\/strong><\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>2.3.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated authentication method to OAuth2 to accommodate Meetup.com&#8217;s API key deprecation<\/li>\n<li>Updated API methods from API v2 to API v3 to accommodate Meetup.com&#8217;s API v2 deprecation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.2.13<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug Fix: Corrected update functionality for version after 2.2.7<\/li>\n<li>Added &#8220;display&#8221; argument for event-list shortcode.

I am using this with the latest Divi Theme (v3) on a Wordpress v4.6.1 with very good success.\n\nI prefer the list view as it resizes fairly well all the way down to mobile view. However, the grid calendar view could be a lot better as it does not resize well at all. It does work well in full screen mode, but it seems unpredictable at other sizes or in a column as it flows over or even off the screen. \n\nAlso in the event page view - the big red meetup button and date area that are in the grey box cannot be edited without some coding knowledge and is not very nice to look at (IMHO). I find it distracting and would prefer to have some options about how that displays. I would also like the option to TURN OFF the Big Red Meetup Button altogether. \n\nAll in all, I think it is good. It is in fact - the only one I can find. I hope that there are future updates and that this doesn't go away. I would be willing to pay for a premium version if it had these features and if it was FULLY responsive in both the list mode and the grid calendar mode. \n\nHope this is helpful to you.   \n\n <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">This plugin really does work.

Of the plugins I've seen this is the only one that does as much as it does. I use both the calendar and event list widget as well as the short codes to place them on pages. The events are also searchable as well as it pulls past events into your database. Great overall. <\/p>\n<p>In terms of improvements I think it would be great to have more options in terms of controlling the sizing, formatting, number of lines displayed, etc. <\/p>\n<p>Finally, the only glaring omission that I personally need\/want is an option to have the link to meetup on the event display open in a new window\/tab instead of leaving the site when clicked.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Good for Meetup admins<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"4 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"4\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dcolanduno\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0b48b40a8bb0b5749d49894ea5703dd2?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0b48b40a8bb0b5749d49894ea5703dd2?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dcolanduno\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">dcolanduno<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>For folks who run a Wordpress site for their group, this is a decent way to notify people of upcoming events without the need for them to login to Meetup to find out.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">A MUST HAVE Plugin for any website with a Meetup Group!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/bibimgirl\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/aac1f990ccdf40fe448f2ed7528b7ba9?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/aac1f990ccdf40fe448f2ed7528b7ba9?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/bibimgirl\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">bibimgirl<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this plugin.  While our organization started as a Meetup group, we've become a full on nonprofit org so we wanted to do be able to promote our events not only on on Meetup, but our own site as well. We have several Meetup event organizers, but only one person for the website. This plugin solved our problem! <\/p>\n<p>This plugin makes it possible to seamlessly integrate your Meetup events to your website's by creating a calendar or as a list. As for us, we use both. As a calendar, we put the short code for the calendar on our \"Calendar of Events\" page. We have the list on a widget that allows you display whatever number of upcoming events.  It really couldn't be any easier. The final result is a simple and uncluttered, which is exactly what I wanted.<\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/>\nWhy I think this is an awesome plugin:<\/strong><br \/>\nIt is convenient because we only need to add an event on Meetup ONLY and then it will automatically sync up with our organization's website without having to do anything. The sync happens maybe once or twice a day, which most of the times is no problem. I really like is the option to do an immediate sync, which comes in handy for those last minute events. All you need to do is hit the \"Update Events Now\" button on the Plugin dashboard in WP. This also comes in handy when I realize I've made a mistake and need to correct something that is already posted. <\/p>\n<p>You have the option to view the event either on your own website OR you'll be routed to Meetup. I chose to have mine directly on the website, which creates a new page with all the info you put on your Meetup event, including pictures, bold text, links, etc. The event page it creates looks really nice. <\/p>\n<p><strong>TIP: <\/strong><br \/>\nIf your \"Content Visibility\" in your Meetup Group Settings is set to \"Partial\" then the location will NOT be listed on the event on your website. You can display the location on your website by changing your Meetup settings to \"Full\" visibility. If you happen to change your settings after the event is posted, it will immediate update once you hit the \"Update Events Now\" button. <\/p>\n<p>I have a couple different websites and as far as plug-ins go - this is one of the BEST. My hats off the the development team - nice work. <\/p>\n<p>The following is NOT a complaint, but rather some extra bells and whistles this fan would love to see in future versions:<br \/>\n- It would be great to have the ability to show the venue WITHOUT having to change to full settings. I understand this might not be possible to do automatically, so I would personally be OK with even the option of manually adding it myself.<br \/>\n-The calendar uses the default website font. Would love the ability to change the font size on the calendar.<br \/>\n-Ability to change the size of the calendar to go beyond just \"full width\" (I believe I saw you're already working on this one, so I'm looking forward to it)<br \/>\n-I love the list because of it's simplicity, but it would be great if there was a way to not start each event with the name of our Meetup group, but rather the event name. Since the name of our Meetup group is long, it takes up 2 lines on our widget. I can see where this is helpful in a situation where you're promoting several different Meetup events, but in our case, its completely unnecessary. Perhaps make adding the name of your Meetup group as an option rather than as a default. <\/p>\n<p>I look forward to these features in future updates. In the meantime, great work.
