On the Layout tab you can customize the general appearance of your plugin, and on Columns tab you can set each column individually, to give it just the look you need.<\/p>\n<h4>Layout tab: choose layout, skin, and arrange the elements in the right way<\/h4>\n<p>We provide you with 3 predefined layout types: columns, grid and table. Choose the one that better fits the general style of your website.<\/p>\n<p>The next option that can be customized on the Layout tab is Skin. Skins allow you to choose the color distribution for your columns, and with a choice of 5 predefined ones, you&#8217;re sure to find the right one of you.<\/p>\n<p>Also, this tab is where you can arrange the order of different elements represented on the columns and duplicate or remove them.<\/p>\n<h4>Columns tab: customize your columns to display the right information in the right way<\/h4>\n<p>Each column of your Pricing Table column is displayed on Columns tab. Here&#8217;s where you can add and remove columns, too, and it&#8217;s incredibly easy to do, just press Add, Duplicate or Remove, and that&#8217;s it!<\/p>\n<p>Each column has 7 settings sections: General, Picture, Title, Features, Price, Button and Ribbon. Let&#8217;s take a close look at every section<\/p>\n<p>General section is where you can make a column display as a featured column. You just need to select Featured Column option to do it. Here&#8217;s where you can set the skin, background and border colors, and set border radius and width.<\/p>\n<p>Picture section is where you can set the pictures for each of your columns. Our plugin comes complete with a beautiful New Age moon design, but you&#8217;re sure to have your own creative ideas concerning how your pricing columns should look. To set your own picture, all you need to do is paste the picture&#8217;s link to Picture URL field.<\/p>\n<p>Title section is where you set title and caption, as well as their fonts, font size and weight, and the text and background colors.<\/p>\n<p>In Features section you set the list of features to be displayed on a column. You can set as many of them as you need, there is no limit. Also, in this section you set the features&#8217; styles and colors and align them in the center of the column or to the left.<\/p>\n<p>Price section is the one where you actually set the price itself, add a caption, and choose their fonts, font size and weight, and the text and background colors.<\/p>\n<p>Button section is where you customize the behavior and appearance of the button: the link it takes you to, the caption, border radius and border width.<\/p>\n<p>In Ribbon section you customize the ribbon text and color.<\/p>\n<p>See more cool <a href=\"https:\/\/elfsight.com\/wordpress-plugins\/?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=wordpress-org&amp;utm_campaign=pricing-table&amp;utm_term=common&amp;utm_content=description\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress plugins<\/a> by Elfsight for your website.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p><strong>How to Add Pricing Table to WordPress &#8211; Automatic Installation (Recommended)<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <code>Plugins &gt; Add New<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Search for &#8220;Elfsight Pricing Table&#8221; and install the plugin<\/li>\n<li>Activate your Pricing Table<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Manual Installation<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download <code>elfsight-pricing-table.2.0.1.zip<\/code> from <code>wordpress.org<\/code> and unzip it<\/li>\n<li>Upload the <code>elfsight-pricing-table<\/code> folder to <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Go to <code>Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins<\/code> and activate the newest Pricing Table<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Manage Elfsight Pricing Table<\/h4>\n<p>After installation there are only few steps left before starting to use the plugin and to embed Pricing Table to your website.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click &#8216;Pricing Table&#8217; in WordPress menu to go to Pricing Table page.<\/li>\n<li>Use the editor to create and setup your first widget.<\/li>\n<li>Copy-paste the widget&#8217;s installation code into any place of your website.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>2.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 5.0 compatibility<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New admin panel<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Support optimization<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changes in the deactivation popup<\/li>\n<li>Links updated<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changes in the deactivation popup<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added deactivation popup<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 4.9 compatibility<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Elfsight Pricing Table release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/elfsight-pricing-table\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1743164\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/elfsight-pricing-table\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1743164\" alt=\"Create your unique and prefect pricing table by selecting layout and skin and arranging the elements in  the right way.\"><\/a><p>Create your unique and prefect pricing table by selecting layout and skin and arranging the elements in  the right way.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/elfsight-pricing-table\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1743164\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/elfsight-pricing-table\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1743164\" alt=\"Select the layout that will work best for you in order to display the benefits and features of your pricing plans in the most appropriate way.\"><\/a><p>Select the layout that will work best for you in order to display the benefits and features of your pricing plans in the most appropriate way.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/elfsight-pricing-table\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1743164\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/elfsight-pricing-table\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1743164\" alt=\"Each column element is individually positioned and customized for the best effect.
