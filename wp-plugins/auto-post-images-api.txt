You can choose to have images selected at random or using the POST ID or POST SLUG.<\/p>\n<p>To insert images into posts you no longer have to insert them one by one using the editor. All you have to do is name them appropriately and upload them to a folder &amp; the plugin will automatically insert them into the corresponding post.<\/p>\n<p>Want to add more images to the post? All you have to do is put more images into the folder and they will show up on the post without having to edit the post.<\/p>\n<p>Need to remove a image from a post? Then just delete the image and it will no longer appear in the post.<\/p>\n<p>No more hassle of editing the post.<\/p>\n<p>Images tagged with the POSTID are displayed on that post. If the thumbnail option is enabled the plugin will use thumbnails in the post to link to the full size images. The plugin will automatically create thumbnails when needed.<\/p>\n<p>Usage: Upload images by naming them as <code>'apiPOSTID'<\/code> where &#8216;POSTID&#8217; is ID of post where the image should be displayed. If you wish to use a different filename format then you can edit the regular expression pattern in the settings page.<\/p>\n<p>Multiple images can be attached to a post simply by ensuring that all of them have the same prefix. For posts that do not have images a default &#8220;Image coming soon&#8221; image is displayed; this can be disabled from the settings screen.<\/p>\n<p>Example Image Name: <code>'api66.jpg', 'api66a.jpeg', 'api66_two.gif', 'api66something'<\/code>, etc. Note: When posting multiple images to the same post by naming them with the same &#8216;apiNNN&#8217; prefix. Avoid numbers immediately after the POSTID. For example: <code>'api662.gif'<\/code> will not work if the ID of the POST is 66; instead name it something like <code>'api66image2.gif'<\/code>. Again, if you wish to use a different filename format then you can edit the regular expression pattern in the settings page.<\/p>\n<p>Demo: <a href=\"http:\/\/sethulakshmi.karunanidhi.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Dash of Salt &amp; A Pinch of Love<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Author Home: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.karthikeyankarunanidhi.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Karthikeyan<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Plugin Home: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.karthikeyankarunanidhi.com\/plugins\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Auto Post Images (API)<\/a><\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin zip file<\/li>\n<li>Upload the plugin contents into your WordPress installation&#8217;s plugin directory<\/li>\n<li>The plugin&#8217;s .php files and readme.txt should be installed in the &#8216;wp-content\/plugins\/auto-post-images-api\/&#8217; directory<\/li>\n<li>From the Plugin Management page, activate the &#8220;Auto Post Images (API)&#8221; plugin<\/li>\n<li>Edit the plugin image\/thumbnail directory path and url in the Plugin Admin Panel to a directory outside the plugin inatallation directory. <strong>Note: If you use the default image directory inside the plugin installation directory you images might get deleted when upgrading<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Copy the &#8220;imagecomingsoon.jpg&#8221; default image from the plugin directory (&#8216;wp-content\/plugins\/auto-post-images-api\/images\/&#8217;)into your image directory.
