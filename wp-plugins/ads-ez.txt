It can work as standalone web application or as a WordPress plugin. Using <em>Ads EZ<\/em>, you can centralize your banner ads in one location, and use simple shortcodes to place them on your blog pages, or generate invocation codes to place them on <em>any<\/em> other web sites or blogs. In the Pro version, you can even serve HTML ads with the same shortcode and invocation code mechanism.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sunset Edition<\/strong><br \/>\n  This update of the plugin is the last publicly released version. We do not expect to make any serious changes or add new features to it from now on.<\/p>\n<p>We may not always be able to provide prompt support for this plugin on the WordPress.org forums. If you would like to have professional support or extra\/custom features, consider buying the <a href=\"http:\/\/buy.thulasidas.com\/ads-ez-pro\" title=\"Get Ads EZ Pro for $15.95\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro version<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Do you have multiple websites which you monetize using advertising?

So I wrote one myself, as an exercise to learn bootstrap and other fancy modern web technology. I think you will like the result.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why would I want to replace my OpenX server?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well, I did, which is why I wrote this package. OpenX is a large application, and consequently quite demanding both in terms of the effort needed to maintain it, and on system resources. It may not be appropriate for small scale, personal ad serving, which needs to be simple and quick. If you have only a couple of hunded banners and don&#8217;t plan on charging for your ads, <em>Ads EZ<\/em> may be the right solution for you. Having said that, I will develop a paid advertising module for <em>Ads EZ<\/em> if there is enough demand for it.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why do I get error message saying something about direct access to plugin files?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin admin interface is designed with a loosely coupled architecture, which means it interacts with the WordPress core only for certain essential services (login check, plugin activation status, database access etc). Loosely coupled systems tend to be more robust and flexible than tightly integrated ones because they make fewer assumptions about each other. My plugin admin pages are fairly independent, and do not pollute the global scope or leak the style directives or JavaScript functions. In order to achieve this, they are loaded in iFrames within the WordPress admin interface.<\/p>\n<p>Your web server needs direct access to the plugin files to load anything in an iFrame. Some aggressive security settings block this kind of access, usually through an <code>.htaccess<\/code> file in your <code>wp-content<\/code> or <code>plugins<\/code> folders, which is why this plugin gives a corresponding error message if it detects inability to access the files (checked through a <code>file_get_contents<\/code> call on a plugin file URL). But some systems implement further blocks specifically on <code>file_get_contents<\/code> or on iFrames with specific styles (using <code>mod_securty<\/code> rules, for instance), which is why the plugin provides a means to override this auto-detection and force the admin page.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is the direct access to plugin files a security hole?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Note that it is only your own webserver that needs direct access to the PHP files. The reason for preventing such access is that a hacker might be able to upload a malicious PHP (or other executable script) to your web host, which your webserver will run if asked to. Such a concern is valid only on systems where you explicitly permit unchecked file uploads. For instance, if anyone can upload any file to your media folder, and your media folder is not protected against direct access and script execution, you have given the potential hacker an attack vector.<\/p>\n<p>In this plugin, its media\/banner upload folder has a multiple layers protection:<br \/>\n1. Only users logged in as admin can ever see the upload interface.<br \/>\n2. The upload script accepts only media file types.<br \/>\n3. The backend AJAX handler also checks for safe file types.<br \/>\n4. The media storage locations are protected against script execution.<\/p>\n<p>So allowing your webserver to serve the plugin admin files in an iFrame is completely safe, in my judgement.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>History<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>V3.20: Compatibility with WP4.8.
