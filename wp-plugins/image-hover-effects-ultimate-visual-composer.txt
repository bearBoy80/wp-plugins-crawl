If you just want a really simple flip box, this plugin is not for you. \nWay too many settings which do stuff you don't want and no settings to change the simple things you need to change. i suppose the simple stuff is on the Pro version, but free version is convoluted and annoying. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/image-hover-effects-ultimate-visual-composer.2.9.4.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/image-hover-effects-ultimate-visual-composer\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1900796","caption":"Flipbox -
