Quikly has its headquarters in London, United Kingdom and is expanding its services in Latin America. It has the lowest fees in the Latin America market, for more information you can ckeckout the official website. https:\/\/pay.quikly.app<\/p>\n<h4>Minimum Requirements<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP version 5.2.4 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)<\/li>\n<li>MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)<\/li>\n<li>WordPress version 5.8 onwards<\/li>\n<li>WooCommerce version 5.6.0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Plugin Configuration<\/h3>\n<p>Once installed, go to Woocommerce -&gt; Settings Pick Checkout Tab and once on that tab go to Payment gateways and click on Quikly, once on Quikly, click on Enable Quikly, and put your Quikly account data. Also, we put the default wordpress, checkout requirred fields as mandatory before the Quikly Modal pop ups like, #billing_email&#8221; if you add your custom requirred fields, please add them on the Form Validation Fields area in Quikly tab, on this format: Ex: #billing_email&#8221;, &#8220;#my_custom_field&#8221;, &#8220;#my_custom_field2&#8221; always use the #id css format. If requirred fields are not filled then Quikly Modal is not going to PopUp. So check this detail before implementing.<\/p>\n<h3>Security Tips<\/h3>\n<p>Before using Quikly, enable the sandbox option, to test the gateway. Only the paranoid survive as Andy Grove, CEO of Intel once said. So test before implementing, here is some sandbox credit card numbers and data to test, https:\/\/pay.quikly.app\/web\/developer Once you see that the order has been marked on the checkout page as processed (not really its, sandbox), disable sandbox.  By the way, on sandbox, for security reasons, payments and are not processed in Quikly and the order is not recorded in woocommerce. If you wish to test, that order processing please contact us to guide you on how to do that on the code. For security reasons, sandbox testing is limited.<br \/>\nAlso remember once the plugin is deleted all Quikly data will be erased.<\/p>\n<h3>More information<\/h3>\n<p>For more information or doubts contact at https:\/\/pay.quikly.app, support@quikly.app<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Install via FTP.
