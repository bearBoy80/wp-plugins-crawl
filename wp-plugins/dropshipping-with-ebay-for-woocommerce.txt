Don't waste your time. The plugin is full of bugs. The plugin has no documentation available. The price formula doesn't work at all. Product code import doesn't work at all. Auto order placement is also not working with the chrome extension with this free plugin. I tried contacting support as I was looking to try the pro plugin but was not happy with their answer. They mislead the price on the main page vs the purchase page. (I have a screenshot for as a proof). Pro plugin has no 7 days trial or guarantee or 7 days worry-free refund policy so can't take a risk by looking at Lite plugin.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">does not work<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ypraise\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/974b0f7b047fddb9ec6898ed8db352a3?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/974b0f7b047fddb9ec6898ed8db352a3?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ypraise\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">kevin heath <small>(ypraise)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">April 4, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">way too buggy.\n\nFirstly does not save the multiplier but I sorted that by hardcoding into the file (see support)\n\nThe multiplier works in the admin screen for variations but when published no vlaues are carried to the published items or variations.\n\nJust packed with bugs.\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/dropshipping-with-ebay-for-woocommerce.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dropshipping-with-ebay-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2644375","caption":"Build-in search tool"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dropshipping-with-ebay-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2644375","caption":"Search results from the search tool"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dropshipping-with-ebay-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2644375","caption":"Import List is a place where you can adjust imported products before pushing them into Woocommerce"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dropshipping-with-ebay-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2644375","caption":"Choose images which you want to be added together with the product into your store"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dropshipping-with-ebay-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2644375","caption":"Main plugin settings"},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dropshipping-with-ebay-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=2644375","caption":"Pricing Rules - set up your pricing markups"},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dropshipping-with-ebay-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=2644375","caption":"Phrase Filtering - remove or replace unwanted text from the content imported from eBay"}},"tags":{"dropship":"dropship","ebay":"ebay","ebay2woo":"ebay2woo","woo":"woo","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dropshipping-with-ebay-for-woocommerce\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2645036","high":false}}
