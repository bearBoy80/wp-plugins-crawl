This plugin lets Legitimate users automatically submit their articles to their Legitimate profile without the need of having to manually visit the Legitimate website and do it.<\/p>\n<p>When you publish a post on WordPress, the URL will be automatically submitted to Legitimates API (https:\/\/www.legitimate.io\/api\/articles\/grab?url=). The Legitimate system will then visit your post and look for the details you added to the Legitimate fields on the edit post page. It will then add a link to the post on your Legitimate profile.<\/p>\n<p>You can visit the site here: https:\/\/www.legitimate.io<br \/>\nOur Terms of Service can be viewed here: https:\/\/www.legitimate.io\/terms<br \/>\nOur Privacy Policy can be viewed here: https:\/\/www.legitimate.io\/privacy<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to contact our team regarding this plugin or anything else, you can do so at this page: https:\/\/www.legitimate.io\/contact<\/p>\n<p>Please note: Submitting and publishing posts and articles to Legitimate that you&#8217;re not the author of will result in your account being suspended.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, thanks to @mrshahrukh123 for designing this plugin.
