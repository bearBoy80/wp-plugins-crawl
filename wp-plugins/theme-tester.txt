You must enable testing on the Theme Tester admin page (Design -&gt; Theme Tester) after which any theme changes by you will not be visible to regular visitors to your blog.<\/p>\n<p>To make any theme changes visible to your visitors you must disable testing and choose your new theme.<\/p>\n<p>Warning! If the theme you are testing writes to blog options that your current theme uses (such as header image or colours), your blog&#8217;s visitors will see those changes. I don&#8217;t expect this to happen too often except if you are testing several themes based on the same theme engine such as K2.<\/p>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/theme-tester.0.3.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"design":"design","themes":"themes"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/theme-tester.0.1.zip","0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/theme-tester.0.2.zip","0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/theme-tester.0.3.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/theme-tester.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
