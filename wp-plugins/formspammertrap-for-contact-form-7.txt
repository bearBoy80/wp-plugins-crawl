It does this with effective techniques, not things that don&#8217;t work &#8211; like hidden fields, silly questions, irritating Captchas, or more. If an automated bot tries to spam your form, they will get blocked.<\/p>\n<p>It is based on our very successful FormSpammerTrap for Comments plugin, which uses the same techniques to effectively block Contact Form Spammers.<\/p>\n<p>More details about how it all works &#8211; and a Contact form that uses the same effective spambot-blocking technique &#8211; is on our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.FormSpammerTrap.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FormSpammerTrap.com Site<\/a>. There&#8217;s a Contact form there that has never been successfully &#8216;spam-botted&#8217; (defined as submitting many comments within a very short period of time).<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Download the zip file, uncompress, then upload to <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory.

Then make sure there is at least one required field in your form. That&#8217;s all you have to do! That will block form spammers from using your Contact Form 7 form.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20use%20the%20shortcodes%3F'>\nWhere do I use the shortcodes?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just place it anywhere in the Contact Form 7 form when you create\/edit the contact form.
