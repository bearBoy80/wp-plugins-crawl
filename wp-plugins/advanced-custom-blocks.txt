I actually think I might ditch Advanced Custom Fields for this completely if they add a few more fields types. For now I'm just using it as an addition for some of my smaller sites.

Color picker,\n2. File picker (for images for example),\n3. Export all the resulting code for all or some of the blocks created with this plugin, so the blocks can be inserted in a theme or plugin for a new website without the need to recreate everything for each site, and without having to resort to export\/import. In other words generate the php, js, etc... code just like ACF (Advance Custom Fields) does, so plugin and theme developers can utilize the blocks within their products easily.\n\nIf shortcodes are eventually going away (so as widgets and custom fields btw...), and we are stuck with the blocks disaster, this would be a great help to somewhat easily convert the shortcodes to blocks. If Automattic had any concerns not to alienate developers like me, and make the Gutenberg's adoption more acceptable, they should had included a tool to convert all the existing shortcodes to blocks, or at the very leasy descent documentation for people who don't know 30 dozens JavaScript libraries! I hope that this plugin will eventually fill that gap and find a way to help out the developers who are only used to making shortcodes using php, html and CSS.\n\nThanks a million for this what it seems a very promising step to solve the blocks creation problem.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/advanced-custom-blocks.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"blocks":"blocks","gutenberg":"gutenberg"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/advanced-custom-blocks.0.1.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/advanced-custom-blocks\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1919623","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/advanced-custom-blocks\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1919623"}}
