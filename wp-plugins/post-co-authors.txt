While managing your website, It would be hard for you to maintain and manage multiple contributors working on the same article.  &#8220;Post Co-Authors&#8221; Plugin will help you to add multiple authors within same post, which makes the Job lots easier for you to track.<\/p>\n<p>Add writers as bylines without creating WordPress user accounts. Simply create a user profile for the writer and assign the byline as you normally would.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Upload <code>post-co-authors<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>1) How do I add  Post Co-Authors support to my theme?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin works on shortcode and is independent of any theme. You will just need to put a short code on the single.php or you can directly add in content area. Check installation steps for using shortcode of our plugin.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>2) What happens to posts and pages when I delete a user assigned to a post or page as a coauthor?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t affect the page anyhow when you delete it. It stores data as standard post meta so, you will not have to worry about deleting data.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>3) Can I use Post Co-Authors with WordPress multisite?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Certainly, you can use it.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>4) Who needs permission to do what?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>For now in version 1.1 we have common functionality for all users so, no permission is needed.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>5) Can I easily create a list of all co-authors?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You dosen&#8217;t even have to create list of co-authors, all users are listed in the post types you select and wish to display for. Our plugin will list all wordpress authors,  editors and administrators for that post and you will have to select only names of required persons<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Post Co-Authors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1581848\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1581848\" alt=\"&lt;p&gt;Activate Post Co-Authors from Plugins.&lt;\/p&gt;\"><\/a><p><p>Activate Post Co-Authors from Plugins.<\/p><\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1581848\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1581848\" alt=\"&lt;p&gt;Select post type to allow this features.&lt;\/p&gt;\"><\/a><p><p>Select post type to allow this features.<\/p><\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1581848\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1581848\" alt=\"&lt;p&gt;You can multi select the authors.&lt;\/p&gt;\"><\/a><p><p>You can multi select the authors.<\/p><\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1581848\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1581848\" alt=\"&lt;p&gt;Use &#039;[co-authors]&#039; shortcode to display on front side.&lt;\/p&gt;\"><\/a><p><p>Use '[co-authors]' shortcode to display on front side.<\/p><\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1581848\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1581848\" alt=\"&lt;p&gt;List of authors on front side.&lt;\/p&gt;\"><\/a><p><p>List of authors on front side.<\/p><\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Doesn&#039;t show other authors in post and uses username as author<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/sleeplessindc\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f4f0636c7df07b97aa40bc4b10a9d94c?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f4f0636c7df07b97aa40bc4b10a9d94c?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/sleeplessindc\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">sleeplessinDC<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 1, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I was really hoping this would work. I wrote a post to test what happens if I indicate a different author or add multiple authors.\n\nSadly this test failed. \n\nFirst problem: The post shows only the logged in username as the author. There is a window in the write post page to check other authors that may be included but it organizes them by role: Administrator, Author, Editor. No matter how many I selected, only one author is shown in the saved post and that is the logged in user.\n\nSecond problem: The Username of the writer is used instead of the name they set up in their profile to be displayed. Usernames should not be displayed. For example, if I write a post while I am logged as Admin, my Admin username is revealed. In user's profiles, they have their user name, first name, last name and a selection list of how they want their name displayed when they write a post. Those are the author names that should be listed to check off when writing the post.\n\nSuggestion: If we can write a post and indicate a different author or authors other than ourselves, it would be nice if we could indicate the order. For example, in scholarly research papers, the primary author (or the one who gets the primary credit such as the professor) is listed first and then those who assisted are listed following the primary author. This system can also be used for authors of a post or page.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/post-co-authors.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1581848","caption":"<p>Activate Post Co-Authors from Plugins.<\/p>"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1581848","caption":"<p>Select post type to allow this features.<\/p>"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1581848","caption":"<p>You can multi select the authors.<\/p>"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1581848","caption":"<p>Use '[co-authors]' shortcode to display on front side.<\/p>"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1581848","caption":"<p>List of authors on front side.<\/p>"}},"tags":{"author":"author","authors":"authors","multi-author":"multi author","multi-authors":"multi-authors","post":"post"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"http:\/\/acquaintsoft.com","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1581848","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-co-authors\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1581848"}}
