Our code formally had several areas these currencies were hard-coded, and egregiously incomplete.  See <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/wp-e-commerce\/WP-e-Commerce\/issues\/1917\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#1917<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Mass improvements to 2.0 theme engine.

Using comparators was causing 3.10.0 to be &#8220;less than&#8221; 3.8, resulting in an unnecessary admin notice.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Changes internal mechanism for detecting which theme engine is in use. The way we were checking for it before caused many core actions to be unhooked, leading to unsavory results, like Fancy Notifications no longer working.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Patched in a few fixes for incorrect usage of esc_url().

See <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/wp-e-commerce\/WP-e-Commerce\/issues\/1444\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#1444<\/a>.

even tried to solved them. So I assume there is no support team.\nEveryone, use WooCommerce, I haven't tried it yet, but it's definitely better supported.\nTo be honest, I am disappointed I can't give them 0 stars instead of 1.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Help, Braintree requires xmlwriter error<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/fivestarg\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/01b1547c22f3deb3b5034ab8200c7279?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/01b1547c22f3deb3b5034ab8200c7279?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/fivestarg\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">fivestarg<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 23, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Hi,\n\nI'm getting the below errors after installing your plugin.

I expect to spend a little time trying to have to figure out a new plugin or product.  That said, I was hoping this would offer a simple but powerful eCommerce solution that requires a unique product setup on my site.   First of all, there is absolutely no documentation that explains how to actually make it usable. Where's the cart? How do I add a checkout to the menus? The documentation makes no attempt to help.  Their \"installation\" page is 1 paragraph, and it tells me basically how to install a WordPress plugin. Duh. I need to know how to setup your product. How to effectively add a product, how to get it to show up in one of my pages, how to get to the cart, how to get to the checkout.. There's just nothing that goes over ANY of this basic but critical information.  Furthermore, their own site where they have documentation, is so riddled with dead links and dead images, and dead video links, I strongly wonder if the product is even still in development. \n\nAlso, I was optimistically going to plop down $99 or so for a premium add on but after this horrible experience I think I'll pass. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great shop<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/bagwell\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/01ab25d57c3c7ca0c616a7a25327db73?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/01ab25d57c3c7ca0c616a7a25327db73?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/bagwell\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">bagwell<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 17, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Thank you for so good plugin.
