This problem is fixed with version 3.1, which will import your previous settings into the new system. If you installed version 3.0 and want your data back, you can roll back to version 2.5 and copy the info from there, then upgrade to 3.0 and re-add all your data. If you don&#8217;t know how to do this, you can also send me an e-mail with your usernames and the services you used and it will be my pleasure to generate the full URLs for you.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I have a suggestion\/comment\/complaint.<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>E-mail me at ez[at]silentlycrashing[dot]net to let me know.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/social-homes\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1573768\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/social-homes\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1573768\" alt=\"Social Homes on my blog.\"><\/a><p>Social Homes on my blog.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/social-homes\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1573768\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/social-homes\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1573768\" alt=\"The Social Homes configuration panel.\"><\/a><p>The Social Homes configuration panel.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/social-homes.3.3.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/social-homes\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1573768","caption":"Social Homes on my blog."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/social-homes\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1573768","caption":"The Social Homes configuration panel."}},"tags":{"blogcatalog":"blogcatalog","blogger":"blogger","bumpzee":"bumpzee","web-2-0":"web 2.0","widget":"widget"},"versions":{"2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/social-homes.2.0.zip","2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/social-homes.2.1.zip","2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/social-homes.2.2.zip","2.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/social-homes.2.3.zip","2.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/social-homes.2.4.zip","2.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/social-homes.2.5.zip","3.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/social-homes.3.0.zip","3.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/social-homes.3.1.zip","3.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/social-homes.3.2.zip","3.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/social-homes.3.3.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/social-homes.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=DWJ8H3RJDNQ26&lc=CA&item_name=Elie%20Zananiri&currency_code=CAD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted","banners":[]}
