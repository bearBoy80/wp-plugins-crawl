For me this would be https:\/\/www.3dhubs.com\/karlsruhe\/hubs\/christian\/3dprint<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Free text: Maybe you need to explain in two lines what 3DHubs is.

If the installation fails check if you can install other plugins, even if there are already some installed (maybe wordpress can&#8217;t write to the disk anymore&#8230;).<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>More description, no code changes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First working version.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/3dhubs\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1065013\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/3dhubs\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1065013\" alt=\"The widget in action on my blog.\"><\/a><p>The widget in action on my blog.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/3dhubs.0.2.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/3dhubs\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1065013","caption":"The widget in action on my blog."}},"tags":{"3d":"3d","3dhubs":"3dhubs","3dprinting":"3dprinting"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/3dhubs.0.1.zip","0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/3dhubs.0.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/3dhubs.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
