And the person making this plug-in is part of the solution which allows Me to succeed in doing that.\n\nThankyou Brad, I'll make some videos and get the word out.\nMy experience btw stemmed from the challenges associated with getting queries and inode data down to ensure that 000webhost.com would not time out My friend's website.\n\nIt took Me many tries to make everything work as it should. I had to work hard to get everything to use less. I ended up having a working store and a firewall with all the trimmings while using only 54% inode data. With authors like Brad - You can too.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/disable-telemetry.1.0.3.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"api":"api","developer":"developer","privacy":"privacy","telemetry":"telemetry","tools":"tools"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/disable-telemetry.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/disable-telemetry.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/disable-telemetry.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/disable-telemetry.1.0.3.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/disable-telemetry.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/disable-telemetry\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2538827","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/disable-telemetry\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2538827"}}
