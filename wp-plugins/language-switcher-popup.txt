It detects the browser language of your user and shows a popup if his browser language is different from the default language of your website. There your user can change the language. Once the user selects a language, the information is stored in a cookie. When he visits the startpage again, he automatically gets redirected to the language he selected.<\/p>\n<h3>Smart display behavior with browser language detection<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin detects the browser language of your user. The pop-up only appears, if the user&#8217;s browser language is different from the default language of your website.<\/p>\n<h3>SEO friendly<\/h3>\n<p>We will only redirect the user after he has chosen a language in the popup. So there is no automatic redirection without user interaction. As it is unclear, how this would affect your SEO.<\/p>\n<h3>Stores user selection in a cookie<\/h3>\n<p>Once the user selects a language, the information is stored in a cookie. This cookie is used to redirect the user to his preferred language.<\/p>\n<h3>Redirects user the next time he visits your website<\/h3>\n<p>When he visits the startpage again, he automatically gets redirected to the language he selected the last time.<\/p>\n<h3>Support<\/h3>\n<p>Please use the support forum I will be happy to help.<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/language-switcher-popup\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2769906\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/language-switcher-popup\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2769906\" alt=\"The language switcher popup for WPML\"><\/a><p>The language switcher popup for WPML<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/language-switcher-popup.1.0.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/language-switcher-popup\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2769906","caption":"The language switcher popup for WPML"}},"tags":{"cookies":"cookies","language-switcher":"language switcher","popup":"popup","selector":"selector","wpml":"wpml"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/language-switcher-popup.1.0.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/language-switcher-popup.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/language-switcher-popup\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2769906","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/language-switcher-popup\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=2769906"}}
