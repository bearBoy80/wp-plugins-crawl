When a video url is found the plugin will embed the video in your<br \/>\nsidebar for viewing. If no video is found, AdSense can be displayed instead so that your not wasting the space. There is an interface which lists all post and has the ability to<br \/>\npaste a video url then save it to a post. Thats a little quicker than actually opening posts then saving videos into the custom fields. There is also an interface which lists all<br \/>\nexists posts that have videos, plus lists the videos under each post for deletion etc. The plugin is new for June 2010, many upgrades coming to help you manage your Blip TV<br \/>\nepisodes and maximise use of the videos you spend hours creating.<\/p>\n<h3>Arbitrary section<\/h3>\n<p>Please contact webmaster@webtechglobal.co.uk with questions<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Standard WordPress upload.<\/p>\n<p>Add a custom field named &#8220;bliptvid&#8221; to your post and paste the bliptv video ID into the value or use the interface to add videos to each post.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Released 18th June 2010<\/li>\n<li>Correcte some basic errors caused by quick changes just before release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Released 17th June 2010<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/blip-tv-episodes-widget.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"bliptv":"bliptv","blog":"blog","builder":"builder","video":"video","youtube":"youtube"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.webtechglobal.co.uk\/featured\/blip-tv-episodes-widget","banners":[]}
