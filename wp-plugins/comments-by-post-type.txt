I would have had to write my own from scratch!<\/p>\n<p>One improvement suggestion - add a Settings &gt; Comments by post type admin page that shows all custom post types with a checkbox (ticked by default) allowing admins to hide the comments on a particular post type. There are some occasions where you don't need comments and for whatever reason don't have access to modify the post type settings to disable comments.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks again!<\/p>\n<p>Alex\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/comments-by-post-type.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"admin-menu":"admin menu","comments":"comments","custom-post-types":"custom post types"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
