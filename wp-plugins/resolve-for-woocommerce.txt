If you\u2019re looking for a better way to manage the nightmare of customer credit checks, net terms risk, payments, and cash flow woes &#8211; Resolve is here to help. We believe your business shouldn\u2019t act like a bank unless you\u2019re actually a bank. Get paid by Resolve in a day, and we\u2019ll let your customers pay us in 30, 60, or 90 days. However your customers buy from you, e-commerce or off-line, we&#8217;ve got you covered.<\/p>\n<p>This extension allows B2B merchants to offer Net Terms to their customers without the hassle of running credit checks, floating short-term credit, chasing payments, and processing payments. When customers request to pay by invoice (e.g., Net 30), Resolve credit checks them and assesses their risk profile. Once approved for net terms, customers can select the \u201cPay with Net Terms\u201d payment selection in the checkout, which gives them 30-90 days to pay while you get paid sooner.<\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce 3.3 or greater.<\/li>\n<li>WordPress 5.0 or greater.<\/li>\n<li>PHP version 7.2 or greater.<\/li>\n<li>SSL must be installed on your site and active on your Checkout pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>INSTALL<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Contact <a href=\"https:\/\/resolvepay.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Resolve<\/a> team and set up your merchant account.<\/li>\n<li>Visit Plugins &gt; Add New.<\/li>\n<li>Search for &#8220;Resolve for WooCommerce&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Activate Resolve for WooCommerce.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>For more installation options check the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/article\/managing-plugins\/#manual-plugin-installation\" rel=\"ugc\">official WordPress documentation<\/a> about installing plugins.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix issues with settings that disable Resolve.<\/li>\n<li>Update tested up to.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Stable release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/resolve-for-woocommerce.1.0.1.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"gateway":"gateway","payment":"payment","resolve":"resolve","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/resolve-for-woocommerce.1.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/resolve-for-woocommerce.1.0.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/resolve-for-woocommerce.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/resolve-for-woocommerce\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2620935","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/resolve-for-woocommerce\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2620935"}}
