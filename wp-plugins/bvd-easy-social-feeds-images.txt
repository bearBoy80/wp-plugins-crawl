use this. It only shows a gray box with the text of your latest status update. No images, doesn't seem to be responsive, used its own font. Didn't gel at all with the rest of the design I'd done.<\/p>\n<p>I didn't even look at the Twitter option. If this gets updated so I can customize the look more and have it use inherited design elements I will consider again since setup was so easy!\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images.1.0.7.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1573842","caption":"Instagram view from the front-end of the site."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1573842","caption":"Instagram setup screen"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1573842","caption":"Instagram display options"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1573842","caption":"Instagram shortcode instructions"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images\/trunk\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1573842","caption":"Facebook setup screen"},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images\/trunk\/screenshot-6.png?rev=1573842","caption":"Facebook display options"},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images\/trunk\/screenshot-7.png?rev=1573842","caption":"Facebook shortcode instructions"},"8":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images\/trunk\/screenshot-8.png?rev=1573842","caption":"Twitter setup screen"},"9":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images\/trunk\/screenshot-9.png?rev=1573842","caption":"Twitter display options"},"10":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images\/trunk\/screenshot-10.png?rev=1573842","caption":"Twitter shortcode instructions"}},"tags":{"facebook":"facebook","instagram":"Instagram","social":"social","social-feeds":"social feeds","twitter":"twitter"},"versions":{"1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images.1.0.3.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images.1.0.4.zip","1.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images.1.0.5.zip","1.0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images.1.0.6.zip","1.0.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images.1.0.7.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1227612","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/bvd-easy-social-feeds-images\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1227607"}}
