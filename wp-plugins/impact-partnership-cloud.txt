This program was written in a way where they do not use hooks or API filters to get only items that are processing (paid) they instead use pending which happens before an order is paid for.<br \/><br \/>This means when an order is pending, (submitted, but not paid for) impact grabs it, and then if payment fails, impact does not know (or care - I have told them). So you will be paying your affiliates commission on all failed orders.<br \/><br \/>Not only that, an affiliate can learn this and exploit it by just creating orders on your site and not even putting in a credit card and when the order fails they will still be paid commission.<br \/><br \/>I know many small businesses will notice this, but big companies or those with lots of orders will never notice.<br \/><br \/>Rather than just change the code (I sent them all the documentation) they just say that it is our responsibility to log into impact and manually delete all failed orders that came to our website.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Outstanding<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mjmarini\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/321585285381fcc9cb193b3e000b9158?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/321585285381fcc9cb193b3e000b9158?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mjmarini\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">mjmarini<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 2, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I became a client of Impact, and just happened to be running my e-commerce site on wordpress with woocommerce.  The plugin and support I received from Impact was outstanding every step of the way.  I installed the plugin, and the team at Impact supported me with detailed instructions for entering the settings for my account.  We ran a test and everything worked beautifully the very first time.  Everything is running smoothly now and I'm setting my sights toward the future and growing my business. I highly recommend Impact and this plugin.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Useless Plugin<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/speedplus\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1006c01cc8b02f7cf4bcc43134174836?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1006c01cc8b02f7cf4bcc43134174836?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/speedplus\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Kostiantyn <small>(speedplus)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 3, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">The plugin does nothing.
