You don\u2019t need to handle permalinks, content replacement, or things that would usually be tedious and maybe not without risk. With Prepare New Versions, all of these are being taken care of!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I create a new version of a post?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>New versions are created from the post editing screen. It can be either an existing post or a pending version of one.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>When I duplicate a post, what\u2019s the status of the newly created copy?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>New posts which are copied from existing posts are automatically created with a Draft status. They are independent of the original post and can be published whenever you like.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How can I quickly see how many pending versions have been created for each post?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you activate the Prepare New Versions plugin, a new column \u201cPending versions\u201d appears in last position, in the Posts list. You can then access these versions by editing the original post and scrolling to the \u201cPending versions\u201d box.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>When I prepare a new version, the permalink differs from the original post\u2019s. What\u2019s going to happen when I update the original post?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you click the \u201cUpdate original\u201d button, the permalink is not going to be altered, and will remain the same. This means it won\u2019t change anything for your blog visitors, except for the updated content.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How can I remove pending versions I don\u2019t use anymore?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you update an original post, previous pending versions are not deleted and will remain available. However, you have 2 ways to remove them:<br \/>\n* go to the pending version editing screen and click \u201cMove to trash\u201d in the \u201cPublish\u201d box:<br \/>\n* go the the Posts list and click the \u201cPending versions\u201d link.You will now access a list of all pending versions and will be able to remove one or several at a time.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.9.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>bugfixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Code refactoring and cleaning<\/li>\n<li>Update readme for pnv_erase_content_destination filter<\/li>\n<li>Security fix: create a nonce for each action and include post ID in it \/ props Julio Potier<\/li>\n<li>Security fix: check user rights on the post before doing anything with it \/ props Julio Potier<\/li>\n<li>Update permalink for &#8216;duplicata&#8217; status posts and always return a shortlink: useful for preview feature \/ props Julio Potier<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.9<\/h4>\n<p>initial public version released<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/prepare-new-version\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=778231\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/prepare-new-version\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=778231\" alt=\"&lt;strong&gt;New handy box in editing view&lt;\/strong&gt; - When creating\/editing a post or a page, users get access to a new box to prepare a new version or create a copy of the document with only &lt;strong&gt;one click&lt;\/strong&gt; !\"><\/a><p><strong>New handy box in editing view<\/strong> - When creating\/editing a post or a page, users get access to a new box to prepare a new version or create a copy of the document with only <strong>one click<\/strong> !<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/prepare-new-version\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=778231\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/prepare-new-version\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=778231\" alt=\"And when you&#039;re ready to update the current online article, it will just take you one more click.
