Something very useful. The only point against that I see is that as soon as the page is changed within the website, the full screen is deactivated and it is necessary to activate it again. The entire website does not stay in full screen mode. Hopefully it improves this aspect to be a complete plugin in this regard.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/fullscreen-button.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/fullscreen-button\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2474384","caption":"Homepage - You can see in the Header the Fullscreen Button"}},"tags":{"button":"button","fu11":"fu11","full-screen":"full screen","fullscreen":"fullscreen","fullscreen-button":"fullscreen button"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/fullscreen-button\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2500033","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/fullscreen-button\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2500033"}}
