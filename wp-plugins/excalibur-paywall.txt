We have used the solution to secure events with over 1000 participants and it has performed flawlessly.  A couple of bonus features that really differentiated the product for us is the ability to support iPhone's Safari browser that defaults cookies to off, the real time reporting capabilities and affiliate tracking.  I'm sure the feature is coming soon but the only other thing I would like to see is the ability to support promotion codes. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/excalibur-paywall.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/excalibur-paywall\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2106725","caption":"Example of an offer"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/excalibur-paywall\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2106725","caption":"Screenshot of price listing to customers"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/excalibur-paywall\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2106725","caption":"Screenshot of the configuration module"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/excalibur-paywall\/trunk\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2106725","caption":"Screenshot of the customer service module where you can look up customers and assist them."}},"tags":{"content":"content","content-monetization":"content monetization","paid-content":"paid content","paywall":"paywall","premium-content":"premium content"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.custompaywallsolutions.com","banners":[]}
