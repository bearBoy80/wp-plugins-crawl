The block is specifically created to be easy to use, flexible and easy to modify quickly.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simplicity:<\/strong> The block is as simple as it can be. It&#8217;s a block that creates a priclist. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s for, nothing else. No confusing settings, styling of the fonts is inherited from your own stylesheet mostly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility:<\/strong> The block adapts to multiple sizes. So you can use it anywhere, in the sidebar, main content, footer, etc.. The line between the description and price will be automatically modified to fit inbetween the two parts. This also allows combining the block with other blocks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Maintainability:<\/strong> The block-settings to disable and enable some fields make the pricelists extremely easy to edit. You can e.g. just keep the prices editable and press tab, edit price, press tab, edit price, etc..<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Further Documentation<\/h3>\n<p>More examples and further documentation can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/pricelist-block.waardwebsites.nl\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Donations<\/h3>\n<p>Donations for developing and maintaining this block are most welcome.
