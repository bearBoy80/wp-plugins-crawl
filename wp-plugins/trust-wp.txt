It doesn\u2019t literally rename or change files in core, nor does it add rewrite rules. It simply intercepts page requests and works on any WordPress website.<\/p>\n<p>The wp-admin directory and wp-login.php page become inaccessible, so you should bookmark or remember the url. Deactivating this plugin brings your site back exactly to the state it was before.<\/p>\n","faq":"<p>I forgot my login url!<\/p>\n<p>Either go to your MySQL database and look for the value of wps_page in the options table, or remove the trust-wp folder from your plugins folder, log in through wp-login.php and reinstall the plugin.<\/p>\n<p>On a multisite install the wps_page option will be in the sitemeta table, if there is no such option in the options table.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.0  &#8211; 25th Feb 2021<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version \u2661.
