Add any product to your cart.&#8221;<br \/>\nThe specified free gift will always get added to the cart, irrespective of what the shopper buys<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cart Total<\/strong> &#8211; &#8220;Unlock a complementary gift with a purchase of over $X&#8221;<br \/>\nThe shopper will qualify for a free gift only when the cart total is a specified amount<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Product(s)<\/strong> &#8211; &#8220;Get a free gift with this product only&#8221;<br \/>\nYou can associate a free gift with certain item (s) in your store.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Note:<\/p>\n<p>In the Lite Version of the plugin, you can only add a different product as a free gift with purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Also, you can turn on the repeater which means more than one gift will get added to the cart as they add more items to their cart.<\/p>\n<p>This is to encourage volume buying.<\/p>\n<p>E.g: <strong>&#8220;Buy More. Get More. Free gift with every pack of supplement you buy.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In addition to the rules in Lite, here are the rules &amp; options you can unlock in the Pro version<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Product Category<\/strong> &#8211; You can attach free gifts to any item bought from a certain category. In that case, whatever item is bought from that category will have the free gift attached.<br \/>\nE.g.:  &#8220;Buy any item from category X and unlock a free gift&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Product Tags<\/strong> &#8211; Offer free gift on items with certainly specified tags.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Payment Gateway used<\/strong> &#8211;  You can attach free gift with purchase only if they make the payment from a specified payment gateway.<br \/>\nYou may only want to offer them a free gift in case they use a credit card or bank transfers and not on C.O.D &#8211; you can do that.<br \/>\nE.g.: &#8220;Use your credit\/debit card to make the payment and get a free gift shipped with your order&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Coupon Code Used<\/strong> &#8211; These promotions are totally possible with Bonanza Pro.<br \/>\nE.g.: &#8220;Get 15% off with coupon code Save15 and get a complimentary free gift&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Order Count<\/strong> &#8211; Order count is the number of times a user has made a purchase from your store.<br \/>\nE.g.: &#8220;Get a surprise free gift with your first order&#8221; Or &#8220;Returning customers get a free gift with their purchase. Make sure you log in to buy&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>In addition, you also get:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Scheduler &#8211; You can schedule the free gift campaign so that it starts at a set date and ends on a certain date.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>E.g: &#8220;It&#8217;s raining gifts! Get a free gift with your purchase till the 25th Dec 7 PM!&#8221;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Same Product &#8211; In the Pro version, you can offer the same product as a free gift.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A typical use case is &#8216;Buy a sipper. Get a sipper free!&#8221;<\/p>\n<h4>The underlying psychology<\/h4>\n<p>In a research conducted by the Carlson School of Management, they found&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>That a hand lotion sold 73% more when a free gift was bundled with it than when it carried an equivalent discount.<\/p>\n<p>Free is powerful and works more effectively than cheap or discounting does.<\/p>\n<p>And if you choose the free gift wisely, people will sample it and come back to buy it &#8211; this can increase its sales by as much as 2000%!<\/p>\n<p>Shoppers also love to share their shopping experience when they snag a free gift.<\/p>\n<p>Successful online store owners have been using free gift with purchase to increase their average order value.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, it&#8217;s an opportunity which doesn&#8217;t deserve to be missed.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Follow the below steps to install the plugin.<br \/>\n1.
