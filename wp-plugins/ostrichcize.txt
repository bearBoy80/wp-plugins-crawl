Ostrichcize allows a plugin or theme developer to<br \/>\nbury his or her head in the sand by turning off error reporting for select plugins or the current theme.<\/p>\n<p>If you have ever installed a plugin or worked on a site with a plugin that throws numerous of errors and notices, but do<br \/>\nnot have the time to fix the issue, you can turn off those notices with this plugin. By simply filtering the plugin, you<br \/>\ncan add to the list of plugins for which no notices will be shown.<\/p>\n<p>To add to this list simply write something like:<\/p>\n<pre><code>function my_ostrichcized_plugins( $slugs ) {\n    $slugs[] = 'debug-bar-cron';\n    return $slugs;\n}\n\nfunction my_pre_my_ostrichcized_plugins() {\n    add_filter( 'ostrichcized_plugins', 'my_ostrichcized_plugins' );\n}\n\nadd_action( 'plugins_loaded', 'my_pre_my_ostrichcized_plugins', 1 );\n&lt;\/pre&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Note that the filter must be added before any offending code is run in order to redefine the error reporting function<br \/>\nbefore it is first called. The means that in most cases, this code will need to run from a plugin and not a theme.<\/p>\n<p>To turn off PHP error reporting for a theme, run:<\/p>\n<pre><code>function my_ostrichcize_theme() {\n    add_filter( 'ostrichcize_theme', '__return_true' );\n}\nadd_action( 'plugins_loaded', 'my_ostrichcize_theme', 1 );\n&lt;\/pre&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Thanks to Jeremy Felt (@jeremyfelt) for assistance naming the plugin!<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Install Ostrichcize if not already installed (https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/ostrichcize\/)<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Setup Ostrichcize rules as noted above<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Is there a UI to add ostrichcize rules?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. At this time, I really only want developer&#8217;s using this tool. Any WordPress developer that is messing with error<br \/>\nhandling should easily be able to make this plugin work. If not, the developer should not be using this tool. Similarly,<br \/>\nusers should not be messing with error reporting.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I run this in production?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You certainly can, but that is not the intent of the tool. It is best to only run this in development.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What is the use case?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is inspired by having installed countless plugins that throw error notices. Many times, these are small,<br \/>\nnon-critical errors. Since I often do not have time to fix the errors myself, I allow them to continue to muck up my<br \/>\nerror logs or on screen display of errors. I thought it would be nice to have a way to hide these errors so that only<br \/>\nerrors due to my custom code are displayed. Ostrichcize allows you to do just that.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Works, but wish it had a UI<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"4 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"4\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/alphatriumph\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c9b5eedf126e4452ce992a8c45b64ce6?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c9b5eedf126e4452ce992a8c45b64ce6?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/alphatriumph\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">alphatriumph<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>Works, and is nice for those of us who like to use notices\/warnings to keep us honest in our PHP while still utilizing poorly-written plugins. <\/p>\n<p>Wish this had a UI to configure it, instead of just hooks, especially since you need to have a plugin to take advantage of it.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ostrichcize.0.1.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"debug":"debug","error-reporting":"error reporting"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ostrichcize.0.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ostrichcize.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/wordpress.org","banners":[]}
