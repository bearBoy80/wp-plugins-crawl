As of version 1.4 of the WordPress Plugin Manager, TTF font<br \/>\nfiles are not allowed elements of plugins. Hence, the bundled font is not<br \/>\ninstalled correctly. You will need to download the tarball or ZIP file and<br \/>\ninstall the font into the WordPress installation?s ?wp-content\/image-headlines?<br \/>\ndirectory. Sorry about that.<\/p>\n<p>Your best bet is to first install the WordPress Plugin Manager and then perform<br \/>\na One-Click installation from there. That?s as simple as it gets. Failing that,<br \/>\nyou?re welcome to download the files and install the image-headlines.php file in<br \/>\n&#8216;wp-content\/plugins&#8217; and the warp1.ttf file in a directory that you create<br \/>\ncalled &#8216;wp-content\/image-headlines&#8217;. That should get everything where it needs<br \/>\nto go. You?ll then need to visit the plugins page of the WordPress<br \/>\nadministration and activate the plugin. See, don?t you wish you?d just used the<br \/>\nPlugin Manager?<\/p>\n<p>In order to have your titles turned into images, you have to change how you get<br \/>\nyour titles! Why? Well, if I went around changing every single invocation of the<br \/>\ntitle into an image you?d have images in your RSS feeds and anywhere else you<br \/>\ncall ?the_title()?. You don?t want that. Instead, you tell me which of your<br \/>\ntitles you want to be images. You do that by editing your template?for instance,<br \/>\nyour Main Template which generally controls how your home page will look?and<br \/>\nsearch for the following text:<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;the_title();&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Shouldn?t be hard to find. Make certain that this is the one you want changed,<br \/>\nit might appear elsewhere in the file. This is the one somewhere after the<br \/>\n?while (have_posts()) : the_post()? stuff. You?ll change this text to look like<br \/>\nthis instead:<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;the_title(&#8216;_image&#8217;);&#8217;<\/p>\n","description":"<p>This plugin allows you to have images created automatically for your entry<br \/>\ntitles. In this way you can utilize non-standard fonts and get smoother<br \/>\nrendering than would be possible with simple text headlines. New to this version<br \/>\nis improved integration with the WordPress administration interface under<br \/>\nWordPress 1.5 Strayhorn as well as genuine soft-shadows behind the text for that<br \/>\nsmooth, custom look the girls love.<\/p>\n<h3>Using other fonts<\/h3>\n<p>The font I?ve included is the lovely Warp 1 by Alex Gollner. If you?d like to<br \/>\nuse some other font you are more than welcome to do so. First, though, you need<br \/>\nto get it on the server. So, find yourself a gorgeous TrueType font?preferably<br \/>\nin Windows format if you have the choice?and stick it on your server. One of the<br \/>\neasiest ways is to use the built-in WordPress Upload utility. You?ll have to<br \/>\nallow ttf files to be uploaded which you can change in the miscellaneous tab of<br \/>\nyour WordPress Options, but once you do that it?s literally just a few clicks to<br \/>\ninstall the font. Simply click the ?Upload? tab in WordPress administration,<br \/>\nbrowse to your font (note that Windows is finicky with the file dialog around<br \/>\nfonts<br \/>\n you?ll have to right-click on your file and hit ?Properties<br \/>\n? and copy<br \/>\nthe filename from the properties and paste it into your file name box in the<br \/>\n?Open<br \/>\n? dialog) and upload it! The plugin automatically searches your configured<br \/>\nupload directory as well as the wp-content\/image-headlines directory for valid<br \/>\nTrueType fonts and lists those in the menu. Experiment with those fonts!<\/p>\n<h3>Configuration<\/h3>\n<p>Following installation you?ll likely want to configure the appearance of your<br \/>\ntitles. Simply go to the Options page of your WordPress installation where<br \/>\nyou?ll see a new option cunningly called ?Headlines?. Click it.<\/p>\n<p>If everything has gone well with the installation you should see a collection of<br \/>\noptions and a nifty preview image of what your current settings look like. Yeah!<br \/>\nNote that if your preview image is showing (it should be an image with ?The<br \/>\nquick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.? in red letters with a soft gray<br \/>\nbackground shadow) you are good to go. You?re welcome to customize it however<br \/>\nyou wish but as far as the plugin is concerned it?s a happy camper.<\/p>\n<p>Let?s talk options.<\/p>\n<h4>General Configuration<\/h4>\n<p>Really if you?re up and running you have nothing much to do here. This just sets<br \/>\nwhat directory the plugin will use to store the images it generates. You can<br \/>\nchange it if you wish.<\/p>\n<h4>Font and Colors<\/h4>\n<p>As you might imagine this section will have the greatest bearing on the<br \/>\nappearance of your titles. You?ll see a menu containing the list of available<br \/>\nfonts and entry boxes for controlling the font size and color as well as what<br \/>\nthe background looks like. Note that all colors you see on this page must be<br \/>\nspecified in HTML color format, so #123456 or #FF0000 or even the shorthand<br \/>\nversion like #CCC. Anything else will break in fantastic and undefined ways and<br \/>\nI will not be pleased if you ask me why your images aren?t showing up and it<br \/>\nturns out that you have GREEN in the color field. You?ve been warned!<\/p>\n<p>If you make your background transparent it will likely look better. Turn the<br \/>\noption on and off to see the difference.<\/p>\n<p>You can have a background image displayed behind your text if you want. I don?t<br \/>\nuse it much but that?s your call.<\/p>\n<h4>Line Spacing<\/h4>\n<p>This will control the formatting of your image a bit, especially as it pertains<br \/>\nto long lines.<\/p>\n<p>The left padding simply tells the plugin to leave some blank space at the left<br \/>\nedge before it starts drawing the text. This may be useful in the case where you<br \/>\nhave a background image you want to include.<\/p>\n<p>You can enable the line-splitting option so that really long titles get split<br \/>\ninto multiple lines before rendering. This is important on fixed-width<br \/>\nblogs?like the default Kubrick template in WordPress, for instance?so that you<br \/>\ndon?t break the appearance if you happen to spout off in your titles like I do.<br \/>\nSelecting this option will break the text into multiple lines if the rendered<br \/>\nline would exceed the maximum line width you specify.<\/p>\n<p>The vertical space is the additional space you want between each line in the<br \/>\ncase that we break up lines. The bigger the number the larger the gap between<br \/>\nthem.<\/p>\n<p>The line indent is the additional space between the left border of the image and<br \/>\nany subsequent lines in the case of a line break.<\/p>\n<h4>Shadows<\/h4>\n<p>You can turn shadows completely off if you so desire. In which case, simply turn<br \/>\noff that ?Enable shadow? checkbox. But where?s the fun in that? You have your<br \/>\nchoice of two shadow styles: soft-shadows and so-called ?classic? shadows.<br \/>\nHere?s the explanation of both:<\/p>\n<h4>Soft Shadows<\/h4>\n<p>Soft shadows look like the shadows that Adobe Photoshop generates for you. They<br \/>\nare generated by drawing the text in the color that you specify in the shadow<br \/>\ncolor parameter after first offsetting the text by the amounts that you specify<br \/>\nin the vertical and horizontal offset parameters. Once that?s drawn the entire<br \/>\nshadow image is blurred mathematically. If you care about the nitty-gritty<br \/>\ndetails, it performs an approximation of a Gaussian blur using a ?squares?<br \/>\nconvolution kernel horizontally and vertically across the image, with the size<br \/>\nof the kernel being based on the ?shadow spread? parameter given. If you don?t<br \/>\ncare about the nitty gritty, think about blurring your eyes and looking at the<br \/>\ntext: the amount you blur your eyes is controlled by the ?shadow spread?<br \/>\nparameter. A small spread means that the shadow will be pretty well defined. A<br \/>\nlarger spread will mean that the shadow is spread out more and more diffuse (as<br \/>\nwell as the color tends to fade as the spread increases).<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE that large shadows means many more calculations and many more<br \/>\ncalculations means it is slower to calculate the final image and making it<br \/>\nslower means using CPU time on the server and using too much CPU time makes ISP<br \/>\nadmins cry. Once a particular image for a particular title is created it doesn?t<br \/>\nhave to be created again, so you don?t have to worry about <em>constantly<\/em><br \/>\nperforming this calculation. But, take it from me, if you have a large spread on<br \/>\na large text size it can take 20 seconds to calculate the shadow for it. And<br \/>\nthat?s 20 seconds of 99% CPU utilization on the server processor which can<br \/>\ncreate problems with certain hosts. You?ve been warned again.<\/p>\n<h4>?Classic? Shadows<\/h4>\n<p>Classic shadows are pretty simple. First, we draw shadow two in the color you<br \/>\nspecify, and we draw it 2 times the number of pixels you specify in the offset<br \/>\nparameter down and to the right of where the final text will be drawn. Then we<br \/>\ndraw shadow one in the color you specify, and we draw it the number of pixels<br \/>\nyou specify in the offset parameter down and to the right. Then we draw the text<br \/>\nin your font color right where you want it. The ?exciting? example on this page<br \/>\nis an example using this method. Using this technique has the advantage that<br \/>\nit?s fast. Using this technique has the disadvantage that it?s ugly. Okay, not<br \/>\nugly, just not as elegant and stylish as the soft ones. Then again I?m biased<br \/>\n I<br \/>\nwrote the soft shadows and Joel Bennett did the classic ones \ud83d\ude42 . Nevertheless,<br \/>\nyou can create some interesting effects with the classic shadows.<\/p>\n<h3>Can I use it for things other than titles?<\/h3>\n<p>Of course you can!<\/p>\n<p>Glad you asked! You can stick this anywhere in your templates?for instance if<br \/>\nyou want your various category titles rendered?or even in your posts and pages<br \/>\nlike the one above. First, if you want to put these images in your posts like<br \/>\nthis?say for fancy dropcaps?you?ll need a very helpful plugin aside from the<br \/>\nImage Headline plugin. Go and find the RunPHP plugin. Install it. Then, wherever<br \/>\nyou want your text to appear, put in a call to the following function (if in a<br \/>\npage or post, be sure to enable the ?eval() Content? option):<\/p>\n<p>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Where the ?formats? string is a list of formats that you want to override<br \/>\nseparated by ampersands (&amp;). Anything you don?t specify will be set exactly as<br \/>\nit is for your entry titles. Each format will be in the form of<br \/>\n?format_name=value? where ?format_name? is defined as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>font_file ? Full path to the TrueType font you want to use.<\/li>\n<li>font_size ? The size in points to draw the text.<\/li>\n<li>font_color ? The color in HTML format either full (#FF0000) or brief (#F00).<\/li>\n<li>background_color ? The color of the background that the image will be<br \/>\ndisplayed over in the same format as above.<\/li>\n<li>shadow_color ? If soft shadows are on?which follows the main setting in your<br \/>\nOptions page?this controls what color to draw the shadow.<\/li>\n<li>shadow_spread ? If soft shadows are on this controls the spread in pixels.<\/li>\n<li>shadow_vertical_offset ? Controls how many pixels down to draw the shadow.<\/li>\n<li>shadow_horizontal_offset ? Controls how many pixels to the right to draw the<br \/>\nshadow.<\/li>\n<li>left_padding ? Number of pixels from the left edge to start drawing the text.<\/li>\n<li>max_width ? The maximum width in pixels allowed before the text is broken into<br \/>\nmultiple lines.<\/li>\n<li>space_between_lines ? The number of pixels between the bottom of the previous<br \/>\nline and the top of the next line for multiline images.<\/li>\n<li>line_indent ? The additional number of pixels to indent subsequent lines in<br \/>\nmultiline images.<\/li>\n<li>shadow_first_color ? The color to draw the first of the ?classic? shadows if<br \/>\nsoft-shadows are not enabled.<\/li>\n<li>shadow_second_color ? The color to draw the second of the ?classic? shadows<br \/>\nif soft-shadows are not enabled.<\/li>\n<li>shadow_offset ? If using ?classic? shadows, the number of pixels separating<br \/>\nthe shadows from the main text and each other.<\/li>\n<li>background_image ? An image to draw under the text in the background.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, if I want to set the font color to red, the size to 20 points, and the<br \/>\nshadow spread to 5 pixels the format string would be:<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;font_color=#F00&amp;font_size=20&amp;shadow_spread=5&#8217;<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/headlines\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1566816\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/headlines\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1566816\" alt=\"\"><\/a><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/headlines.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/headlines\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1566816","caption":""}},"tags":{"headlines":"headlines","images":"images","replacement":"replacement"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/headlines.0.1.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
