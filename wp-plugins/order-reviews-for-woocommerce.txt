It will really be easy to collect reviews, but there are some flaws in the logic of its use. It allows you to leave only one review for all ordered products in one order. Which is logically wrong if people decide to write about the experience of using specific products. Thus, by opening the product card, you can see the reviews of other customers who write not about this at all.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great plugin!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/raven56\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8810ce3353769fbfd4c6caeda9b23015?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8810ce3353769fbfd4c6caeda9b23015?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/raven56\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">raven56<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 14, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Awesome!
