Its shows reviews and congregates overall ratings from facebook, yell and google my business. \n\nThe downside.....the actual tool menu has minimal options for customisations. There appears to be some degree of choosing what to display with 4 different shortcodes, but the plugin would be better served by giving the user the ability to select what they want to display. There is one section where it gives the options of all posts, then a bunch of dead menu options, then three short codes boxes all labelled ALL REVIEWS. One displays nothing, one displays only written reviews the other displays the star reviews and the written reviews. It used to only display the star options, but this is has since changed from when i first implemented it. \n\nBasically, the plugin author needs to allows the plugin user the freedom to decided layout. \n\nThe font, even though it can be changed, really should follow the themes parent font selection. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">service<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jamesdnichols27\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d77e807143db68ce03b2f2377804c35f?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d77e807143db68ce03b2f2377804c35f?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jamesdnichols27\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">jamesdnichols27<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>Great navigation\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/yext.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"content":"content","list":"list","menu":"menu","product":"product","yext":"yext"},"versions":{"1.1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/yext.1.1.2.zip","1.1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/yext.1.1.3.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/yext\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1808808","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/yext\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1808808"}}
