Not sure if it has caused any conflicts yet but if it does, I'll remove it with no complaints, after all it is only tested up to 4.1.0. and it was released to the community in good faith. It is so simple, install, activate, done. It starts working instantly.<\/p>\n<p>The point of this review is to speak up for plugin developers in general, who in this case have released a very practical useful plugin for free. They give their time and effort so that people like me can create something faster, better and safer, than if I (we) had to delve beyond basic code modification.<\/p>\n<p>So if anyone happens to read this, please show some restraint before leaving totally negative reviews. Why not compliment the idea of a plugin, explain why it didn't work for you and say \"Thanks for the effort\" . If a plugin is just simply bad, then an honest rating should be applied but feedback to the author first would be a courteous approach and give the author a chance to offer support.<\/p>\n<p>It would be useful if the developers in this case could confirm its version compatibility beyond 4.1.0 as I am sure that more users would adopt it. I found it on a Google search, second result on page one, the search string being \"wordpress remove meta tag plugin\"<\/p>\n<p>I tried it just for the hell of it<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks for sharing the product of your efforts\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/remove-generator-tag-for-wordpress.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"generator":"generator","meta":"meta","security":"security"},"versions":{"2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/remove-generator-tag-for-wordpress.2.0.zip","2.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/remove-generator-tag-for-wordpress.2.0.1.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/thisismyurl.com\/downloads\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/remove-generator-tag-for-wordpress\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1053604","high":false}}
