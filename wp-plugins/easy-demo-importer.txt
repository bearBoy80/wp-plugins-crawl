Please note that there are three mandatory files: <strong>XML File, Customizer File, and Widget File<\/strong>. The XML file (.xml) needs to be renamed as <code>content.xml<\/code>, the Customizer file (.dat) as <code>customizer.dat<\/code>, and the widget file (.wie) as <code>widget.wie<\/code>, after that these files will be automatically recognized by the demo importer.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20see%20the%20demo%20importer%20in%20action%3F'>\nHow can I see the demo importer in action?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A sample configuration is provided in the <em>plugin directory -&gt; samples<\/em> folder along with a sample zip file.
