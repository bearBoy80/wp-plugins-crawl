Your author data will no longer be tied solely to the WordPress user system, and can now be managed on a per-post basis. Author name and description are saved with each post, allowing you to preserve this information as it was when the post was published.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Features<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Per-post author display name and biographical info<\/li>\n<li>TinyMCE (WYSIWYG) editor for user profile and per-post biographical info<\/li>\n<li>rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; link inside biographical info entries<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>author-customization<\/code> directory to the <code>wp-content\/plugins<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the <code>Plugins<\/code> menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Adjust the settings on the <code>Author Custom<\/code> Settings page<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='what%20data%20about%20an%20author%20gets%20saved%20to%20post%20metadata%3F'>\nWhat data about an author gets saved to post metadata?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The post author&#8217;s display name and biographical info are copied from their user profile.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20turn%20per-post%20author%20info%20on%20or%20off%20at%20any%20time%3F'>\nCan I turn per-post author info on or off at any time?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin saves author info to each post you edit whether or not you&#8217;ve enabled displaying author data from the post metadata. If you decide later that you want per-post author information to be displayed, any post you&#8217;ve created or edited since installing the plugin will already be set up to do this.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20assign%20multiple%20authors%20to%20a%20post%3F'>\nCan I assign multiple authors to a post?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at the moment.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20not%20seeing%20any%20author%20information%20on%20my%20posts%21%20what%27s%20gone%20wrong%3F'>\nI&#8217;m not seeing any author information on my posts! What&#8217;s gone wrong?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order for author information to appear on your posts and pages, the theme you&#8217;re using must have support for this. If it does, you should see your author info changes without issue. If you know it shows author information but you&#8217;re not seeing the changes you made using this plugin, pop over to the Support area. If your theme does not have support for author info, contact the theme developer.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.3.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested with WordPress 5.7 and Gutenberg.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.3.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed PHP tag syntax for rendering the rich editor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.3.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug causing author info not to be saved to post meta if the user doesn&#8217;t have permissions to edit other users&#8217; posts and pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.3.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Full support for WordPress 3.9 and TinyMCE 4.0<\/li>\n<li>Fixed the plugin upgrade process to ensure deprecated settings are upgraded, and upgrades run more smoothly for all future versions<\/li>\n<li>Option to turn WYSIWYG on or off has been removed.
