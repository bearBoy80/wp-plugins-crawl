Visit arqspin.com to learn more!<\/p>\n<p><strong>How it works:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Arqspin is a 360\u00b0 photography solution that works right from your phone, tablet, or DSLR camera. Simply place your object on a turntable and use our free iOS app to capture, edit, and share an interactive 360\u00b0 spin, or use your own camera and our online editor.<\/p>\n<p>The Arqspin WooCommerce Extension lets you connect spins from your arqspin.com account to your WooCommerce store in only a few short clicks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why 360?:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Large e-commerce retailers have been using 360\u00b0 photography for years to allow their customers to more completely experience products before they purchase.<\/p>\n<p>360\u00b0 photography has also been shown to reduce returns and lower customer service requests by helping customers educate themselves before purchasing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; products with a 360-degree spin feature have conversion rate at least 10% higher and sometimes as much as 30-40% higher than products without it.&#8221; -Internet Retailer Magazine<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why now?:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most equipment currently used to make 360\u00b0 photography costs anywhere from $2,000-$5,000. These complex proprietary systems are difficult to setup and use. Studios that offer 360\u00b0 photography services typically charge anywhere from $150-$250 per product shot.<\/p>\n<p>We leveraged our deep expertise in computer vision to create Arqspin, a much simpler and more affordable way to make 360\u00b0 photography. All you need is a smartphone or video camera and a way to rotate the object you want to spin (anything from a lazy susan to a motorized turntable will work). Now, you can showcase your products like the largest e-commerce merchants in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Get started today for free at arqspin.com<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Installing the Arqspin WooCommerce Extension is incredibly simple, and can be completed in only a few steps.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>First download the Arqspin WooCommerce Extension zip file from the WordPress Plugin Store.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve downloadloaded the .zip file, unpack it by double clicking on the .zip file itself.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>After the file has been unpacked, move the folder to the plugins folder located within the wp-content folder within your WordPress app.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the file has been placed in the plugins folder, simply go to your admin page for your site and activate the plugin.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Beautiful Spins!
