The LCP image detection directly relies on the existing WordPress core heuristics that determine whether to not lazy-load an image. The only difference is that, while multiple images may not be lazy-loaded, only a single image will be annotated with <code>fetchpriority=\"high\"<\/code>.<\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>Installation from within WordPress<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Search for <strong>Fetchpriority<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Install and activate the <strong>Fetchpriority<\/strong> plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Manual installation<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>fetchpriority<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory.<\/li>\n<li>Visit <strong>Plugins<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the <strong>Fetchpriority<\/strong> plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20submit%20my%20plugin%20feedback%3F'>\nWhere can I submit my plugin feedback?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Feedback is encouraged and much appreciated, especially since this plugin may contain future WordPress core features.
