See the screenshots for an example of how to use this plugin.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin is a fork of the Embed Bible Passages plugin (https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/embed-bible-passages\/) made necessary by changes in the ESV Bible Web Service API. (Version 2 included Bible reading plans, but is deprecated and was terminate completely on 15 April 2021. Version 3 is the only version available to new users, but does not include Bible reading plans.) Since the American Bible Society API provides more than 20 English language versions (with the potential for more via the Digital Bible Library to acquire the necessary licenses) and over 1600 languages and the Bible Brain API provides 10 English versions and access to over 1700 Bible versions in more than 1500 languages. In addition it has the potential for audio and video for many of the versions. We hope this fork promises a much broader future than did the Embed Bible Passages plugin. The ESV Bible Web Service API, Version 3, however, has also been included in this plugin because it provides audio directly with the texts as well as better formatting control, even though it naturally provides only the English Standard Version.<\/p>\n<p>If the &#8220;Display Plan Name on Pages&#8221; on the settings page is unchecked, the page displayed to the public will all be in the language of the bible_id used in the shortcode, with the exception of the copyright information and potentially the calendar.<\/p>\n<p>It is hoped that persons with skills in other languages will come forward to localize this plugin for the available languages. (I.e., Translate things like the instructions on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; page, the reading plan names, and copyright statements.)<\/p>\n<p>The values of reading_plan can be:<\/p>\n<pre><code>back-to-the-bible-chronological - Back to the Bible Chronological\nbcp19-acna-evening - Book of Common Prayer, 2019, Anglican Church in North America -- Evening Prayer\nbcp19-acna-morning - Book of Common Prayer, 2019, Anglican Church in North America -- Morning Prayer\nbcp19-acna-twoyear - Book of Common Prayer, 2019, Anglican Church in North America -- Two Year Plan \nchronicles-and-prophets - Chronicles and Prophets\ndaily-light-on-the-daily-path-evening - Daily Light on the Daily Path -- Evening\ndaily-light-on-the-daily-path-morning - Daily Light on the Daily Path -- Morning\nevery-day-in-the-word - Every Day In the Word\ngospels-and-epistles - Gospel and Epistles\nheart-light-ot-and-nt - Heartlight Old and New Testament\nlsb - Literary Study Bible\nmcheyne - M'Cheyne One-Year Reading Plan\none-year-chronological - One Year Chronological\npentateuch-and-history-of-israel - Pentateuch and History of Israel\npsalms-and-wisdom-literature - Psalms and Wisdom Literature\nthrough-the-bible - Through the Bible in a Year\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The default reading plan is M&#8217;Cheyne One-Year Reading Plan.<\/p>\n<p>We may add more plans in the future, but have created a premium plugin &#8220;Create Bible Reading Plans&#8221; (https:\/\/sllwi.re\/p\/1Il) to make it possible to create one&#8217;s own Bible reading plan for use in this plugin.<\/p>\n<p>The values of source can be:<\/p>\n<pre><code>ABS - American Bible Society (API.Bible)\nDBP - Bible Brain (aka Digital Bible Platform) (faithcomesbyhearing.com\/bible-brain\/developer-documentation)\nESV - ESV Bible Web Service API (api.esv.org)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The default source is DBP.<\/p>\n<p>(Note that, in order to use these sources, you must obtain Access Keys from the American Bible Society, the Bible Brain, and\/or the ESV Bible Web Service API.
