You can either allow or disallow visitors from defined countries to (parts of) your content.<\/p>\n<p>For instance if you have content that should be restricted to a limited set of countries you can do so.<br \/>\nIf you want to block rogue countries that cause issues like for instance hack attempts, spamming of your comments etc you can block them as well.<\/p>\n<p>Do you want secure your WordPress Admin backend site to only your country? Entirely possible! You can even block all countries and only allow your ip address.<\/p>\n<p>And even if you block a country you can still allow certain visitors by putting their ip address on the allow list just like you can allow a country but put ip addresses on the block list from that country.<\/p>\n<p>You can show blocked visitors a message which you can style by using CSS or you can redirect them to a page within your WordPress site. Or you can redirect the visitors to an external website.<\/p>\n<p>You can (dis)allow visitors to blog articles, blog categories or pages or all content.<\/p>\n<p>Stop visitors from doing harmful things on your WordPress site or limit the countries that can access your blog. Add an additional layer of security to your WordPress site.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin uses the GeoLite database from Maxmind. It has a 99.5% accuracy so that is pretty good for a free database. If you need higher accuracy you can buy a license from MaxMind directly.<br \/>\nIf you cannot or do not want to download the GeoIP database from Maxmind you can use the GeoIP API website available on https:\/\/webence.nl\/geoip-api\/<\/p>\n<p>If you want to use the GeoLite database from Maxmind you will have to download the GeoIP database from MaxMind directly and upload it to your site.<br \/>\nThe WordPress license does not allow this plugin to download the MaxMind Geo database for you.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware that although this plugin can help you greatly with reducing the number of &#8216;bad&#8217; visitors on your website it is not fool proof and those who really want to visit your site may find a away.<br \/>\nThis is not a security issue but a simple fact of today. Nobody can guarantee you 100% security as it is a constant battle between the good guys and the bad guys.<\/p>\n<p>If you are sure your webhosting or yourself does not use any form of caching or proxying we recommend setting the &#8220;Override IP information&#8221; on the Home tab to REMOTE_ADDR<\/p>\n<p>Do you need help with this plugin? Please email support@webence.nl.<\/p>\n<h4>GDPR Information<\/h4>\n<p>This plugin stores data about your visitors in your local WordPress database. The number of days this data is stores can be configured on the settings page. You can also disable logging any data.<\/p>\n<p>Data which is stored of blocked visitors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP Address<\/li>\n<li>Date and time of the visit<\/li>\n<li>URL that was requested<\/li>\n<li>Country of the IP address<\/li>\n<li>If the block happened on your backend or your frontend<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Data which is stored on non blocked visitors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you allow tracking (yeah if you do!) you share some information with us. This is only the IP address of a blocked request on your backend. No other information is send and only the IP address is logged on our systems to gather how many times that IP address have attempted to login to a backend. We do not log which site was visited or which URL just only the IP address So we cannot lead an ip address back to a specific website or user. If an IP address is not blocked again within a month we will remove the IP address from the list.<\/p>\n<p>If you use the GeoIP API service you send the IP address of your visitor to one of our servers. This IP Address is however in no way stored at our servers and only used to convert it to a country id.<\/p>\n<h4>Using this plugin with a caching plugin<\/h4>\n<p>Please note that many of the caching plugins are not compatible with this plugin. The nature of caching is that a dynamically build web page is cached into a static page.<br \/>\n If a visitor is blocked this plugin sends header data where it supplies info that the page should not be cached. Many plugins however disregard this info and cache the page or the redirect. Resulting in valid visitors receiving a message that they are blocked. This is not a malfunction of this plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Disclaimer: No guarantees are made but after some light testing the following caching plugins seem to work: Comet Cache, WP Super Cache<br \/>\nPlugins that do NOT work: W3 Total Cache, Hyper cache, WPRocket<\/p>\n<h3>GeoIP API<\/h3>\n<p>For your convenience we offer a GeoIP API service. This API is not mandatory to use as you can always use the free MaxMind GeoIP Database.<\/p>\n<p>If you do not want or can&#8217;t go through the hassle of updating your MaxMind GeoIP database we provide an API service to convert the IP address of your visitors to a country.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to purchase an GeoIP API Key via https:\/\/webence.nl\/geoip-api\/ you&#8217;ll get an eMail with your API Key (License Key).<br \/>\nOnce you enter this key in your iQ Block Country settings your license key will be validated at our API service and a the nearest API server to you will be chosen. To do this your website will contact all API servers once to request<br \/>\nan empty file.<\/p>\n<p>Once you use the API service the IP address of your visitors and your API key are send to one of the API servers and converted to a country. The plugin checks if the visitor should be blocked based on that country or not.<\/p>\n<p>What is logged on our end?<br \/>\n* Upon validation of your license key your request will be logged in our webserver logs. (This will be the IP address of your webserver).<br \/>\n* Upon checking an IP address of your visitor this IP address is only used to convert it to the country it belongs to and is not logged. We have no way to link a visitors IP address to your website.<br \/>\n  What is logged is your API Key and the Website URL making the request.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to purchase the GeoIP API key your PayPal account will be charged by PayPal on a yearly basis. If you want to cancel your subscription you can cancel the subscription at the PayPal website.<br \/>\nIf no payments are made by PayPal your API key will automatically expire.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy policy regarding this service specific can be found here: https:\/\/webence.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Privacy-Policy-Webence-API.pdf<\/p>\n<h3>MaxMind Database Usage<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin uses the Free version of the MaxMind GeoIP2 Country Database. You can also use the paid version but will have to make sure it is uploaded to the same location with the filename of Free database.<\/p>\n<p>MaxMind Terms of Use: https:\/\/www.maxmind.com\/en\/terms-of-use<br \/>\nMaxMind Privacy Policy: https:\/\/www.maxmind.com\/en\/privacy-policy<\/p>\n<h3>Admin Block API<\/h3>\n<p>For some extra protection we offer the Admin Block API Key. This contains a list of known IP addresses that have visited various WordPress backends in the past month and were blocked.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to purchase an Admin Block API Key via https:\/\/webence.nl\/admin-block-api\/ you&#8217;ll get an eMail with your API Key (License Key).<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to purchase an Admin Block API Key all visitors of your backend will be matched against this list and even if the visitor is from a country that is not blocked they will be blocked if the IP address is on the Admin Block List.<\/p>\n<p>What is logged on our end?<br \/>\n* Upon validation of your license key your request will be logged in our webserver logs. (This will be the IP address of your webserver).<br \/>\n* Upon retrieving the updated blocklist (multiple times a day) this request is logged in our webserver logs (This will be the IP address of your webserver).<\/p>\n<p>Privacy policy regarding this service specific can be found here: https:\/\/webence.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Privacy-Policy-Webence-API.pdf<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Unzip the archive and put the <code>iq-block-country<\/code> folder into your plugins folder (\/wp-content\/plugins\/).<\/li>\n<li>Create an account at https:\/\/www.maxmind.com\/en\/geolite2\/signup<\/li>\n<li>Login to your account.<\/li>\n<li>Download the GeoIP2 Country database (name is GeoLite2-Country.tar.gz) from your account.<\/li>\n<li>Unzip the GeoIP2 database and upload the GeoLite2-Country.mmdb file to your upload dir usually \/wp-content\/uploads\/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb<\/li>\n<li>If you do not want to or cannot download the MaxMind GeoIP database you can use the GeoIP API.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Go to the settings page and choose which countries you want to ban.

See the &#8220;How come I still see visitors&#8230;&#8221; FAQ for that.<\/p>\n<p>If you think you have a visitor from a country you have blocked lookup that specific IP address on the tools tab and see which country MaxMind thinks it is.

You are also able to include images, so you could visualize that people are banned from your site.<\/p>\n<p>You can also provide a link to another page explaining why they might be banned. Only culprit is that it cannot be a page on the same domain name as people would be banned from that page as well.<\/p>\n<p>You can use for instance:<\/p>\n<p>  body {<br \/>\n    color: red;<br \/>\n    background-color: #ffffff; }<br \/>\n    h1 {<br \/>\n    font-family: Helvetica, Geneva, Arial,<br \/>\n          SunSans-Regular, sans-serif }<\/p>\n<p>Go away!<\/p>\n<p>you basicly can use everything as within a normal HTML page.

My IP address is not detected properly\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The iQ Block Country plugin does it&#8217;s best to detect the real IP address of your visitors even if they try to hide it. However sometimes it fails in doing so and in that case you might get an different IP address for your users.<br \/>\nFor instance your webhosting IP address.<\/p>\n<p>You can overrule this process if it does not work properly in your case. Go to the Tools tab there is a section IP Address Information.

Unfortunately the plug-in goes in conflict with the SEOPress plug-In, destroying all the optimisation work. \nIn order to restore the SEOPress to the normal, is necessary to re-generate the entire .haccess file. I don't know how it will work with other SEO plug-In but my experience was very painful. I lost time and i guess several position in the rank.
