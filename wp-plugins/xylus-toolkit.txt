The Toolkit adds a few custom post types. The plugin is not a requirement to use Xylus themes, but it will extend the themes to function as you see them in the demos.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Where are the Toolkit settings?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>All options have been automated, and you do not need to change any settings. Features are activated based on their support defined in the theme.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I use this plugin with other themes?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Xylus Toolkit was developed to extend the functionality of Xylus Themes specifically, however parts of it may be useful to other themes. If using your own theme, you may have to provide some extra styling or modifications to customize it to your needs.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: some bug fixes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Version.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/xylus-toolkit.1.1.0.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"theme":"theme","toolkit":"toolkit","xylus":"xylus","xylus-themes":"xylus themes"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/xylus-toolkit.1.0.0.zip","1.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/xylus-toolkit.1.1.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/xylus-toolkit.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/xylusthemes.com","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/xylus-toolkit\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1378552","high":false}}
