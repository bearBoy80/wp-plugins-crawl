The plugin looks up your post title, content, excerpt and tags, matches the key words with already available categories and automatically assigns the post to those relevant categories.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin will be really helpful if your website has a huge number of post and post categories. The plugin minimizes the effort of manually assigning each and every post to relevant categories.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you create a post with a title &#8220;IPhone 5S Reviews&#8221; and you have categories like &#8220;IPhone&#8221;, &#8220;Reviews&#8221; available, then the post gets automatically assigned to these categories.<\/p>\n<h4>Compatibility<\/h4>\n<p>The plugin is fully compatible with the recent versions of WordPress.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatible with older WordPress versions, down to 3.0.<\/li>\n<li>Multilingual Support is included with the plugin and is fully compatible with WPML.<\/li>\n<li>Support added for common importers like WordPress Importer and WP All Import.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Configurable<\/h4>\n<p>WP Smart taxonomy is completely customizable. Among others, you may enable\/disable smart category(ies), append with existing categories, choose whether to generate smart category associations from post titles and tags.<\/p>\n<p>From version 1.0.3 onwards, the settings can be overriden for individual posts.<\/p>\n<p>From version 1.0.8 onwards, collections can also be made using post content or excerpt.<\/p>\n<h4>Upcoming Features<\/h4>\n<p>The plugin now only works with default WordPress posts and taxonomies.<br \/>\nIn the upcoming version we will be adding support for custom post types and taxonomies.
