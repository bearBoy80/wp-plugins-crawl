With Beyond Identity, you can say goodbye to password fatigue and improve your website&#8217;s security.<\/p>\n<p>Once activated, you will see:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Passwordless UI that integrates seamlessly on with the WordPress login page.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Beyond Identity Settings page for WordPress admins to configure their Beyond Identity account.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Beyond Identity filter on the WordPress Dashboard&#8217;s Users page to view which users use passkeys.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Before you begin<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You will need a Beyond Identity account to configure this plugin.<br \/>\nBeyond Identity currently uses &#8220;Universal Passkeys,&#8221; which are specific to Beyond Identity and have two benefits over your average FIDO2 passkeys.<br \/>\n1. Universal Passkeys never leave the device on which they are created. This makes them much more secure.<br \/>\n2. Universal Passkeys work everywhere. Some browsers (Firefox) do not support passkeys. Universal Passkeys work everywhere, even on Firefox.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coming soon:<\/strong> Vanilla WebAuthn FIDO2 passkeys. These passkeys allow syncing between devices and work with passkey managers.<\/p>\n<p>As a Beyond Identity admin, you will have several configuration options including selecting passkey flavors and customizing the login page.<\/p>\n<h3>Admin Set Up<\/h3>\n<p>First, sign up for a free developer account by visiting: https:\/\/www.beyondidentity.com\/developers<\/p>\n<p>Once you have a developer account you will need to set several values for the OIDC server. Follow the steps below to configure a Beyond Identity application. Most defaults are fine. However make sure the following are set:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>In your Beyond Identity Console, navigate to the <strong>Apps<\/strong> tab under Authentication<\/li>\n<li>Tap <strong>Add an application<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Set <strong>Protocol<\/strong> to <strong>OIDC<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Set <strong>Client Type<\/strong> to <strong>Confidential<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Set <strong>PKCE<\/strong> to <strong>Disabled<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Set <strong>Redirect URIs<\/strong> to include <code>https:\/\/${your-website-domain.com}\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php?action=openid-connect-authorize<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Set <strong>Token Configuration<\/strong> &gt; <strong>Subject<\/strong> to <strong>id<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>At the top of the page, navigate to your application&#8217;s <strong>Authenticator Config<\/strong> tab<\/li>\n<li>Set <strong>Configuration Type<\/strong> to <strong>Hosted Web<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>The recommended defaults for <strong>Authentication Profile<\/strong> are fine but feel free to modify<\/li>\n<li>Tap the <strong>Submit<\/strong> button to save your changes<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Finally, go to your WordPress dashboard and find the Beyond Identity Settings page. You will need three generated values from your newly created application. You can find the <strong>Issuer URL<\/strong>, <strong>Client ID<\/strong>, and <strong>Client Secret<\/strong> in the Beyond Identity Console&#8217;s application that you just created.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on how Beyond Identity works, visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.beyondidentity.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">developer documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For help, reach out on <a href=\"https:\/\/join.slack.com\/t\/byndid\/shared_invite\/zt-1anns8n83-NQX4JvW7coi9dksADxgeBQ\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Slack<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Shortcodes<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin also provides shortcodes that can be used on any page or post.
