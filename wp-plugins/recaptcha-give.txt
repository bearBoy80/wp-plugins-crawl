That&#8217;s why we created reCAPTCHA for Give.<\/p>\n<p>Donation forms are a favorite target for spam bots and fraudsters looking to test stolen credit card numbers. It can become a serious issue, affecting site performance &amp; lead to your payment gateway suspending or even closing your account. That&#8217;s where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/recaptcha\/about\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google&#8217;s reCAPTCHA<\/a> comes in.<\/p>\n<h4>How reCAPTCHA works<\/h4>\n<p>reCAPTCHA uses an advanced risk analysis engine &amp; adaptive challenges to keep malicious software from engaging in abusive activities on your site. Meanwhile, legitimate users will be able to login, make purchases, view pages, or create accounts and fake users will be blocked.<\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hMJsCBUBhcY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<h4>reCAPTCHA may not be the best option<\/h4>\n<p>reCAPTCHA may not be the best option for some sites.
