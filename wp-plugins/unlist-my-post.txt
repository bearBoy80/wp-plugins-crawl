If you would like to stop people reading unlisted posts, you should change the post status to private instead.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why are unlisted posts still being listed?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin uses a selection of hooks and filters to exclude the unlisted posts and pages but there is the potential for compatibility issues with other plugins. Always test the plugin before using on a production site.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I choose which post types can be unlisted?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. To do this, you will need to use the <code>unlistable_post_types<\/code> filter hook which will pass an array of post types that can be unlisted.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/danieltj27\/Unlist-My-Post\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository<\/a> for information on version history.<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unlist-my-post\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2050797\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unlist-my-post\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2050797\" alt=\"The setting that is shown on the edit post screen.\"><\/a><p>The setting that is shown on the edit post screen.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unlist-my-post\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2050797\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unlist-my-post\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2050797\" alt=\"The column that is added to the posts list table.\"><\/a><p>The column that is added to the posts list table.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/unlist-my-post.3.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unlist-my-post\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2050797","caption":"The setting that is shown on the edit post screen."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unlist-my-post\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2050797","caption":"The column that is added to the posts list table."}},"tags":{"archive":"archive","filter":"filter","hide":"hide","post":"post","unlist":"unlist"},"versions":{"3.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/unlist-my-post.3.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/unlist-my-post.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unlist-my-post\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2050797","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/unlist-my-post\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2050797"}}
