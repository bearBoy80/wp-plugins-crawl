With this plugin, you can create and add a popup to your site in minutes, with least effort and no coding. Then you can create newsletters in the same way you write posts or building pages. Litesub will deliver them for you, handle the unsubscriptions, and track the opens.<\/p>\n<p>In your newsletter, you can choose the posts you want to send to the subscribers. They will be listed in the newsletter and presented in your site&#8217;s theme. Now you can easily build elegant newsletters like those big companies do.<\/p>\n<p>At this moment, Litesub delivers newsletters with Gmail API, so you will need a Gmail\/Gsuite account. More delivery methods like SMTP, Mailchimp, will be added soon.<\/p>\n<p>Litesub is free if you have less than 2000 subscribers, and depending on your Gmail account type, can send at most 500 or 2000 mails for you per day.<\/p>\n<h3>Minimum Requirements<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP version 5.2.4 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)<\/li>\n<li>MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>litesub<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu<\/li>\n<li>Go to &#8216;Litesub&#8217; dashboard page, then &#8216;My Litesub&#8217; to set up your Litesub account and do settings<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<p>Initial release<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Installation Instructions<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>litesub<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu<\/li>\n<li>Go to &#8216;Litesub&#8217; dashboard page, then &#8216;My Litesub&#8217; to set up your Litesub account and do settings<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1831728\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1831728\" alt=\"Write newsletters in the same way your write a post\"><\/a><p>Write newsletters in the same way your write a post<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1831728\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1831728\" alt=\"Select which post to be listed in the newsletter\"><\/a><p>Select which post to be listed in the newsletter<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=1831728\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=1831728\" alt=\"How the newsletter will look like\"><\/a><p>How the newsletter will look like<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=1831728\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=1831728\" alt=\"Simple popup built with Litesub form builder\"><\/a><p>Simple popup built with Litesub form builder<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/litesub.1.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1831728","caption":"Write newsletters in the same way your write a post"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1831728","caption":"Select which post to be listed in the newsletter"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=1831728","caption":"How the newsletter will look like"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=1831728","caption":"Simple popup built with Litesub form builder"}},"tags":{"email-list":"email list","marketing":"marketing","newsletter":"newsletter","popup":"popup","subscription":"subscription"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/litesub.1.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/litesub.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=1831728","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litesub\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=1831728"}}
