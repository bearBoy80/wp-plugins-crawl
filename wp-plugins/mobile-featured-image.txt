Sometimes WordPress does not quite resize the featured image in the best way. Avoid this and have full control over your featured images on any device with this plugin.<\/p>\n<p>To add a mobile featured image, simply upload a new image in the meta box right below the WordPress Featured Image called <em>Mobile Featured Image<\/em>. The new image can be a specifically resized version of your featured image or an entirely new image targeted especially for mobile viewers.<\/p>\n<p>You can add your mobile featured image without worrying about slowing down your site. The mobile image is added to the <code>srcset<\/code> attribute of your featured image. Vistors&#8217; browsers will automatically download the best image for the size of their screen.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin works by filtering the <code>wp_calculate_image_srcset<\/code> function and changing the url for all screens under 980w to the mobile featured image. 980w is a reliable breakpoint between the iPhone 6+ and the iPad, two common measures for when a mobile image would be needed.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>mobile-featured-image<\/code> folder to your \/wp-content\/plugins\/ directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Do I have to add a mobile featured image to every post?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope!

The mobile image is added to the srcset attribute of the featured image. The visitor&#8217;s browser will download only the image they need. Leverage responsive images and speed up mobile experiences!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How does the plugin work?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress automatically adds a <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTML\/Element\/img#Example_3_Using_the_srcset_attribute\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">srcset attribute<\/a> to your featured image. The srcset tells modern browsers which image is most appropriate for the size of the screen&#8217;s device so the visitor doesn&#8217;t have to download a giant image to show on a small phone screen.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<p>Initial release<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mobile-featured-image\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1597469\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mobile-featured-image\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1597469\" alt=\"The same post, when viewed on a desktop or phone, shows two different images for the featured image\"><\/a><p>The same post, when viewed on a desktop or phone, shows two different images for the featured image<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mobile-featured-image\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1597469\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mobile-featured-image\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1597469\" alt=\"Add the mobile featured image in the metabox just below the featured image.\"><\/a><p>Add the mobile featured image in the metabox just below the featured image.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Breaks my admin edit post and edit page<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/saxman58\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d06b36ea717e640d8aefbe4f1ce4047a?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d06b36ea717e640d8aefbe4f1ce4047a?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/saxman58\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">saxman58<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">April 20, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This plugin messes up the wp-admin edit pages:\n\n- Many of the page features disappear (e.g.- excerpt, slug, sharing button, Yeost SEO edit boxes)\n- Screen Options tab on the top will not open, so I can't reach the settings to turn page features on\/off.\n- A box shows up at the bottom of the sidebar for Mobile Featured Image, but there is no way to select an image -
