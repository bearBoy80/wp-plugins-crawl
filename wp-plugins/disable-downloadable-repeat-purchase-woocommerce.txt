In place of the &#8220;Add to Basket&#8221; button on the product page, a message will display informing the user they already own the item, and links to download the linked files are provided there. Those links are the special links to the file that are provided on the &#8220;My Downloads&#8221; page, or part of the &#8220;My Account&#8221; page.<\/p>\n<p>If the user has had a refund for the item, or if they have used up all of their allowed download (when product has a limited number of downloads) then the normal &#8220;Add to Basket&#8221; button will show again, allowing purchase.<\/p>\n<p>On any page that displays the products other than the single product page, the button shows as &#8220;Read More&#8221;, as though the product is not available.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Just install the plugin as normal and activate it.
