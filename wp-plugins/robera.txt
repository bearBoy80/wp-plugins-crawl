That will take a while intentionally. If we receive all your data at once, your loading speed will fall immediately. So have patience and come back few hours later.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cTraining the Engine\u201d means that Robera have received your data and is learning your users\u2019 behavior. This phase doesn\u2019t take much time; maybe less than 10 minutes.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cReady\u201d means \u201cReady\u201d! Now you can use the plugin\u2019s features.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nHow long after setting up the plugin does it take to enable the recommendation block?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>When the status is \u201cReady\u201d. Before that, you cannot use the Robera Recommendation block in any of the pages because the engine has not been ready for recommending any item. This is also true about the Related Products. This preparation will take few hours.<br \/>\nOnce the engine\u2019s status is ready, both Related Products and Robera Recommendation block will be enabled and ready to use.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nWhere do I find the User Recommendation block?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It\u2019s like other WooCommerce blocks. Open a page to edit &gt; add a block &gt; WooCommerce &gt; choose the Robera Recommendation block.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nHow much will the recommendations increase my conversion?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Roughly CTR increases 30% to 100%, but it depends on your business type and size of data, but the more you use the service, the more data Robera will have to learn and reach better recommendations. At the first step we will just receive your sell history because you didn\u2019t save your page views respected to each person, but once you activate the service, page views and products added to carts will be saved on Robera\u2019s server which are valuable information to train the system.<br \/>\nRemember that by \u201cconversion\u201d we mean \u201cclicking\u201d. We will just increase the probability of clicking on items and you are the one who has to care about collecting good products in your shop.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nWhat is \u201cRelated products section class name\u201d?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The css classes of the html block that shows Related Products in every product page of your website. Robera needs to know this to count the number of users\u2019 clicks on related products. In many themes its css class is \u201crelated products\u201d. Be sure to check this. If the class is \u201crelated products\u201d you don\u2019t have to bother yourself to set this in plugin settings.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/robera\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2367354\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/robera\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2367354\" alt=\"activating related products\"><\/a><p>activating related products<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/robera\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2367354\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/robera\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2367354\" alt=\"adding robera user recommendations block pt.1\"><\/a><p>adding robera user recommendations block pt.1<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/robera\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=2367354\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/robera\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=2367354\" alt=\"adding robera user recommendations block pt.2\"><\/a><p>adding robera user recommendations block pt.2<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/robera\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=2367354\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/robera\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=2367354\" alt=\"adding robera user recommendations block pt.3\"><\/a><p>adding robera user recommendations block pt.3<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">best plugin for related product offers<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mostafash98\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ce528b0829a6153cd9a7abd0ecc19d52?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ce528b0829a6153cd9a7abd0ecc19d52?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mostafash98\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">mostafash98<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 25, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">best plugin for related product offers<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.17.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/robera\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2367354","caption":"activating related products"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/robera\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2367354","caption":"adding robera user recommendations block pt.1"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/robera\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=2367354","caption":"adding robera user recommendations block pt.2"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/robera\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=2367354","caption":"adding robera user recommendations block pt.3"}},"tags":{"e-commerce":"e-commerce","ecommerce":"ecommerce","recommendation":"recommendation","recommender":"recommender","related-products":"related products"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.0.zip","1.0.10":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.10.zip","1.0.11":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.11.zip","1.0.12":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.12.zip","1.0.13":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.13.zip","1.0.14":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.14.zip","1.0.15":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.15.zip","1.0.16":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.16.zip","1.0.17":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.17.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.3.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.4.zip","1.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.5.zip","1.0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.6.zip","1.0.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.7.zip","1.0.9":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.1.0.9.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/robera.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
