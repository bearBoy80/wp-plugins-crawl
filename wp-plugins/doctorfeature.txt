The picture will be composed of a gradient of either two or three beautiful colors, and each gradient will be associated with the category of your article. It will be up to you to select among a few fonts, the size of the text and the text color. The plugin will print the text over the generated picture and you&#8217;ll have your own featured image ! \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>doctorfeature<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Log In to your WordPress Dashboard and go to menu <code>Dashboard &gt; DoctorFeature &gt; Settings<\/code> to setting DoctorFeature<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Installation Instructions<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>doctorfeature<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Log In to your WordPress Dashboard and go to menu <code>Dashboard &gt; DoctorFeature &gt; Settings<\/code> to setting DoctorFeature<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I modify the actual gradient or set my own gradient?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure!
