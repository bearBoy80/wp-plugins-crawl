Take a look at your theme&#8217;s <code>404.php<\/code> file to see how the template needs to be structured. You can also hook into the <code>wp_410_response<\/code> action to trigger any specific events for queries resulting in a 410 response.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Will this plugin work if a caching\/performance plugin is active ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin has been tested with the following caching plugins, and should work even if they are active:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>W3 Total Cache<\/li>\n<li>WP Super Cache<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I have not tested it with other caching plugins, and there is a high chance that it <strong>will not work<\/strong> with many of them. Most of them will cache the response as if it is a 404 (page not found) response, and issue a 404 response header instead of a 410 response header.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/410-delete-pages-seo\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2288179\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/410-delete-pages-seo\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2288179\" alt=\"\"><\/a><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/410-delete-pages-seo.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/410-delete-pages-seo\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2288179","caption":""}},"tags":{"error":"error","gone":"gone","robots":"robots"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
