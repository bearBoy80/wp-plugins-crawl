Things like the categories, post author, comment link, and copyright information if you choose.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why can&#8217;t I add other WP or PHP functions in the freetext area?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can! WP functions done work very well in freetext, but there&#8217;s no reason to have most of them in your feed anyway. PHP works just fine though.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Are you going to be adding any new features\/incorporating any other plugins with the next release?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve thought about it, but I&#8217;m open to suggestions on what to add. Get in contact with me and we&#8217;ll talk about it over a cup of coffee.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What happened to the Sociable function in this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sociable added this function into it&#8217;s own plugin, so I&#8217;ve removed it from mine as it doesn&#8217;t really serve much of a purpose.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s new in v 1.5?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We&#8217;v added the ability to add the link to the post author&#8217;s website (or whatever link they have in their profile).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Possible Problems<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any plugin that can display the same content in your feed as it does in your posts will be displayed before and after the RSSupplement items have been placed in your feed if you display the full text. The simple solution is to turn off the feature that adds to your feed and just rely on the one that adds the feature into your post. This is not a problem, however, if you display only the summary.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/rssupplement\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1433231\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/rssupplement\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1433231\" alt=\"This is what the options page looks like.\"><\/a><p>This is what the options page looks like.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Can be used to add anything to post rss text<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"4 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"4\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mirojanosik\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/56321f6407bf9add66756025018e1c8e?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/56321f6407bf9add66756025018e1c8e?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mirojanosik\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">mirojanosik<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 16, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Bad: checkboxes (add author and other) do not work\nGood: adding custom text or <strong>custom PHP code<\/strong> works well.
