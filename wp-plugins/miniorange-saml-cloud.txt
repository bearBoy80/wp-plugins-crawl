By building trust and loyalty with customers, CIAM can help you acquire more customers, build more customer interactions, and influence cross-sells.<br \/>\nCustomer Identity Management System gathers data about customers as they move through the customer journey. This data is used to build a profile of customer preferences on WordPress, which can then be used to customize product offerings and communications. New information, such as a change of address, is automatically shared with apps that use the customer profile.<br \/>\nAlthough CIAM and IAM solutions share the same building blocks, the traditional IAM solutions cannot be extended to replace\/act in place of a CIAM solution. The unique requirement of a client-facing application needs a flexible and scalable Identity and Access Management solution that requires a dedicated solution built on top of IAM features.<br \/>\nBy exploiting identification data to gain and retain consumers, CIAM generates revenue growth. CIAM systems are intended to supply, authenticate, authorize, collect, and store consumer information from a variety of sources.<\/p>\n<h4>Benefits of using the CIAM WordPress plugin:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Effortless Secure Login<\/strong><br \/>\nCIAM WordPress ensures that only authorized users get access to sensitive data.
