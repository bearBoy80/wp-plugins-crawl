The index can be included in any page, post or text widget. Here&#8217;s an <a href=\"http:\/\/texttheater.net\/woerterverzeichnis\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">example<\/a> of such an index.<\/p>\n<p>I wrote this plugin because I like to invent words and define them on my blog, thereby creating a dictionary distributed over several posts. Not only was there no list of all the words available, it was also that Google wouldn&#8217;t find the words because it couldn&#8217;t deal with the stress marks I put in there, dictionary-style. Lexicographer solves both of these problems.<\/p>\n<p>Lexicographer&#8217;s index is divided into sections, according to the initial characters of terms. Such sections are currently created for the Latin letters (A-Z, letters with diacritics are grouped with the non-diacriticized versions), Hindi characters, and Telugu characters. A single section &#8220;#&#8221; is created for all Arabic digits (0-9). All other initial characters go into a special section titled &#8220;*&#8221;. Contributions to add support for other writing systems are welcome!<\/p>\n<h3>Usage<\/h3>\n<p>Lexicographer does not add any new elements to the WordPress admin interface.  Instead, you use it as follows:<\/p>\n<p>In the posts and pages where you define terms, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.support.wordpress.com\/wordpress-editor\/#configuring-a-block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">use &#8220;Edit as HTML&#8221;<\/a> and put the words and terms to index in spans of class <code>lemma<\/code>, like so: <code>&lt;span class=\"lemma\"&gt;\u02ccsu\u00b7per\u00b7ca\u00b7li\u02ccfra\u00b7gi\u00b7lis\u00b7tic\u02ccex\u00b7pi\u00b7a\u00b7li\u02c8do\u00b7cious&lt;\/span&gt;<\/code> (the stress and hyphenation marks are of course optional).<\/p>\n<p>In the page (or post, or text widget) where you&#8217;d like the index to live, paste the following shortcode:<\/p>\n<p>[lexicographer_index]<\/p>\n<p>At this place, the index will be inserted. It will consist of the defined terms, linking to the definitions.<\/p>\n<p>Shortcode attributes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>anchorlinks [true\/false, default: true]: If true, anchored links to the terms<br \/>\nwill be created. If false, links to the post(s) containing the term will be<br \/>\ncreated.<\/li>\n<li>headerlevel [int, default: 3]: Which heading level to use for the capical<br \/>\ncharacters in the index.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Support<\/h3>\n<p>If you have questions or suggestions, contact me at poststelle \u00e4t texttheater d\u00f6t net.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Either:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search for and install Lexicographer directly through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in<br \/>\nWordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Or:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and unzip Lexicographer<\/li>\n<li>Upload the <code>lexicographer<\/code> directory to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for Telugu and Hindi (contribution by Sriram Nadiminti).<\/li>\n<li>Tested with WordPress 5.1.1.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed how the Lexicographer index is inserted in posts and pages.

It's extremely easy to use and setup. Just provide some markup for the words you want in the lexicon, enter the shortcode where you want the lexicon to appear and you're done.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a large number of words (100+) to index, there are probably better options. The plugin does not support any form of sub-pages, i.e. if you have several words that start with an \"a\", they'll all be listed below each other. That being said, this a great, free plugin, which I highly recommend.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lexicographer.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"dictionary":"dictionary","glossary":"glossary","index":"index","lemmas":"lemmas","words":"words"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
