Once activated you need to choose which file types it should cache: images, CSS, JavaScript and\/or the rest. Wp-admin and preview asset requests are never cached. It relies on HTTP request&#8217;s &#8220;Accept&#8221; header to determine the type of resource requested, and will use the first recognized mime type entry in the header.<\/p>\n<p>It needs to modify .htaccess to work, therefore it will only work on Apache setups with modifiable root .htaccess.<\/p>\n<h4>Docs &amp; Support<\/h4>\n<p>Issues on https:\/\/github.com\/miguelcalderon\/wordpress-swc-plugin.<\/p>\n<h4>Features:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Service Worker Cache.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mc-service-worker-cache.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"service-worker-cache":"service worker cache"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
