WooCommerce adds the price of the cheapest variable product in the structured data for all variations of a product. Because of this there will be a mismatch between the product price you provide to Google in your Google Shopping product feed and the structured data price on the product landingpage. Google will therefor disapprove the product in its merchant center. You won&#8217;t be able to advertise on that product in your Google Shopping campaign. Our plugin has a feature that will fix the structured data on variable product pages by adding the correct variable product price in the JSON-LD structured data so Google will approve the variable products you submitted.<\/p>\n<h4>Add critical Google Shopping Feed fields to your store (Elite version)<\/h4>\n<p>Google requires you to add certain fields to the feed you create for Google Shopping. However not all of the required fields are present in WooCommerce. Our plugin add&#8217;s these fields \/ attributes for you so you can create a product feed that meets Google&#8217;s requirements. The plugin will add the following product input fields for you: Brand, GTIN, UPC, MPN, EAN, Product condition (New, Refurbished, Used) unit pricing measure, unit pricing base measure, installment and an Optimised title field.<\/p>\n<h4>Performance based<\/h4>\n<p>Only add products to your feed that had sales before in a given time-range. This will make your campaigns more profitable.<\/p>\n<h4>Custom Fields<\/h4>\n<p>Add custom fields with naming you require and fill it with static or dynamic values to your product feed.<\/p>\n<h4>Static field values<\/h4>\n<p>Add static field values to your product feed when needed.<\/p>\n<h4>Category \/ taxonomy mapping<\/h4>\n<p>Some marketing channels require you to map your categories to theirs (such as Google Shopping). This plugin enables you to exactly do that. Not only does it support 1-to-1 category mapping but you can also map subsets of products on a channel-category based on product names.<\/p>\n<h4>Google Shopping<\/h4>\n<p>Our plugin offers added and advanced features for creating the best possible product feed for Google Shopping. Feeds created by our plugin have a high approval rate on products in Google&#8217;s Merchant center.

The default WooCommerce annotation is 94002&#8230;95460 so this was resulting in warnings in Google&#8217;s Merchant Center.

This no longer is needed, creating just one category mapping for these products is enough, no need to map all categories. Also, when a category mapping is missing for a product the google_product_category field will be empty as of now, whereas previously the plugin put the WooCommerce category name which obviously resulted in disapprovals in Google&#8217;s Merchant Center as Google did not recognise those categories.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.3.6 (2018-07-04)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug: category names that contained a &#8221; could not be mapped to Google&#8217;s categories.

Those have been removed now.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.2.8 (2018-06-22)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug: sale prices that were inserted excl. VAT and show incl. VAT on the website did not contain VAT in the product feeds. This has now been solved.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a bug: multiply rules on numeric values containing a comma did not work. This has now been solved.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.2.7 (2018-06-22)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Hyphens are now also allowed for XML elements when one adds a custom attribute field<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.2.6 (2018-06-21)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Made changes to the Miinto templates so they now all support Denmark, Netherlands and Poland localized fields<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.2.5 (2018-06-20)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>We made a change to how category filters are working.

WooCommerce adds the price of the cheapest variable product in the structured data for all variations of a product. Because of this there will be a mismatch between the product price you provide to Google in your Google Shopping product feed and the structured data price on the product landingpage. Google will therefor disapprove the product in its merchant center. You won&#8217;t be able to advertise on that product in your Google Shopping campaign. The plugin now contains and option to fix the structured data on variable product pages by adding the correct variable product price in the JSON-LD structured data so Google will approve the variable products you submitted. Prices you provide in your Google Shopping product feed for variable products will now match the actual prices of those products on yor product pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.1 (2018-14-02)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue with the g:identifier_exists attribute for Google Shopping product feed<\/li>\n<li>Added helptexts to the attribute mapping page<\/li>\n<li>Now allowing underscores in XML namespaces for custom feed fields<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.0 (2018-09-02)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cleaned-up the list of attributes to map and set filter and rules on making it easier to map fields and set filter or rules.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.9 (2018-07-02)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for filtering on empty fields<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.8 (2018-06-02)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for custom fields that are being added by other plugins<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.7 (2018-04-02)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added conversion data to the debug.log in preparation for filtering on product conversions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.6 (2018-02-02)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin now automatically puts currency prefixes in place for Google Shopping and Facebook feeds as this is required by Google Shopping. As a result your Google Shopping product feeds will now contain a default currency so you do not have to add the currency yourselves in Google&#8217;s merchant center<\/li>\n<li>Minor changes for Beslist.nl and Beslist.be templates<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.5 (2018-30-01)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed minor bug: questionmark was appended to the link attribute when tracking was disabled for simple products.

This field shows the so-called breadcrumb and can be used for your productfeed (needed for Prisjakt)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.9.9 (2018-17-01)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support boxes during configuration of a product feed and changed the content of the support email notification text<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.9.8 (2018-16-01)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug: Category mappings with a strange character in it where not saved properly.
