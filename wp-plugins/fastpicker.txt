FastPicker is located in the Netherlands and takes privacy very seriously. Therefore, FastPicker will not store any information longer than strictly necessary. It will store order information for a maximum of 2 hours and won\u2019t store any GDPR sensitive data in our database. Packing slips will be deleted from our server after being printed by you. Due to EU GDPR legislation, FastPicker offer you a GDPR data processor agreement bound by EU laws. You can check this data processor agreement in your account at fastpicker.io and you may agree with it if needed to comply with EU GDPR rules.<\/p>\n<p>We are not Mark Zuckerberg and after your data!
