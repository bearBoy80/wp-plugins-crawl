But to do so, you\u2019d normally have to use a custom taxonomy. With Post Connector, you can directly relate post types to post types, foregoing all the hassle of having to create loads of custom taxonomies and just allowing you to do what you really want to do.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Premium features<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Pro version of the plugin comes with the following features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sortable post connections<\/li>\n<li>Backwards linking (parent to child AND child to parent)<\/li>\n<li>A developer friendly API<\/li>\n<li>Priority support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.post-connector.com\/?utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=after-features-link\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More information<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/www.post-connector.com\/go-pro\/?utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=after-features-link\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Upgrade now &gt;&gt;<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h4>No coding required<\/h4>\n<p>Creating links, linking posts and displaying posts in Post Connector can all be done without coding.

Of course you can add the widget multiple times, displaying different links and\/or different parents. Next to this you can set the widget\u2019s title, choose whether you want the child posts to be clickable and if you would like to display the excerpt for each child.<\/p>\n<p>Post Connector also includes a shortcode  for displaying linked posts.
