You can import simple, grouped, external or variable products. You can easily import, export or update hundreds, even thousands of products using one file which saves your effort and time for manually adding product information.<br \/>\nFor importing products to your online store, you must create a CSV\/XLS file, which contains information about fields in the tabular form. You can create a CSV\/XLS file by using a spreadsheet application such as Google Spreadsheets or Microsoft Excel or Open Office. Save this file with extension .csv\/.xls. After entering all details about products in the spreadsheet, you can import products to your online store.<br \/>\nPre-requisites<br \/>\nThe CSV\/XLS Import file must be in UTF-8 format.
