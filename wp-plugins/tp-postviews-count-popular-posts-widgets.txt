I do not understand why it is so little to find and use. It's easy and well done.\nBesides, you can FINALLY hide the counter on single pages. Such as. on the home page or contact form. THANK YOU!\n1 - 2 options are still missing for me, for example. that you can maybe customize the colors or icon. But otherwise I am satisfied. Many Thanks.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/tp-postviews-count-popular-posts-widgets.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"post-views":"post views","post-views-count":"post views count","views":"views","wp-popular-posts":"wp popular posts","wp-post-views":"wp post views"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/tp-postviews-count-popular-posts-widgets\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1839464","high":false}}
