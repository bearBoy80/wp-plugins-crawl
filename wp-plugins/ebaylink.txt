Now, after switching to ebaylink, I am seriously questioning whether to bother with ebay. Ebay link is horribly difficult to use and setup. My seller rating has bottomed out as a result. Support is responsive and I have no complaints there, however, I fail to understand why ebay has shifted to this user-unfriendly option.\nI used to have a soft fluffy kitty who loved me as mush as I loved her. My kitty got hit by a car and died. \nI always wanted a siamese - complex, elegant, sophisticated.  So, I got a siamese. It was moody and aggressive. I could never truly understand what it wanted and spent far too much time trying to love the surly beast. It wasnt her fault, she was just programmed that way.\nEbaylink is a siamese cat. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ebaylink.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"ebay":"ebay","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ebaylink\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2017297","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ebaylink\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=2017290"}}
