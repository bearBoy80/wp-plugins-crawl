When a user shares your post using these buttons, they can share a vanity URL that is either automatically generated or customized by you and is specific to that button. When another user on social media then clicks on that shared link, the vanity URL redirects them to your page with analytics tracking automatically.<\/p>\n<p>By adding campaign parameters to the destination URLs, you can collect information about the overall efficacy of these campaigns, and also understand where the campaigns are more effective. For example, your \u201cSummer Sale\u201d campaign might be generating lots of revenue, but if you\u2019re running the campaign on several social media platforms, you\u2019ll want to know which of them is sending you the customers who generate the most revenue. Or if you\u2019re running different versions of the campaign via email, video ads, and in-app ads, you can compare the results to see where your marketing is most effective.<\/p>\n<p>The campaign parameters that are automatically added are sent to Google Analytics when a user clicks on one of the shared links, and the related data is available in the campaigns reports. Below is a list of the campaign parameters that are added and their possible values:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>utm_source<\/code>. Possible value(s): <code>facebook<\/code> | <code>twitter<\/code> | <code>linkedin<\/code> | <code>pinterest<\/code> | <code>email<\/code> | <code>vanity-url<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>utm_medium<\/code>. Possible value(s): <code>social<\/code> | <code>email<\/code> | <code>vanity-url<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>utm_content<\/code>. Possible value(s): <code>socialized-share-link<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>utm_campaign<\/code>: Possible value(s): <code>socialized<\/code> | or define in <em>Settings<\/em><\/li>\n<li><code>utm_term<\/code>:  Possible value(s):  Defined by typing in the text box in the metabox on the post or page | or the \u201cFocus keyphrase\u201d by Yoast SEO<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Your permalink struture will not be affected.

You can change the name of the campaign, or the value of <code>utm_campaign<\/code>, from the plugin settings page.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20vanity%20url%3F'>\nCan I change the vanity URL?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! When a new post is created, a random string will be generated for that post, but you can edit it to be whatever you want. However, it will be suffixed with a dash and a character to recognize the platform and map it to the correct campaign parameters.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20affect%20my%20page%27s%20url%2C%20permalink%2C%20or%20canonical%20url%3F'>\nDoes this affect my page&#8217;s URL, permalink, or canonical URL?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This won&#8217;t have any effect on your page&#8217;s URL, permalink, permalink settings, or canonical URL. The vanity URL is simply another way of getting to your page but with the added Google campaign parameters automatically added. This plugin does not create any new pages, only redirects, so there won&#8217;t be any duplicate content issues.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20affect%20my%20page%27s%20seo%20or%20%E2%80%9Cpage%20rank%E2%80%9D%3F'>\nDoes this affect my page&#8217;s SEO or \u201cpage rank\u201d?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It will not harm your page&#8217;s SEO. Since the vanity URLs redirect using 301 permanent redirects, the \u201cpage rank\u201d is transferred to your original page, preserving your SEO value.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20affect%20my%20domain%20authority%3F'>\nDoes this affect my domain authority?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but in a good way! Using a URL shortener service like bit.ly or TinyURL gets a miniscule amount of \u201cdomain authority\u201d when pages are redirected through their domains since it is ultimately their URL that gets shared on other websites. You actually gain this bonus back when it is your domain that gets shared instead.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20it%20choose%20an%20image%20to%20share%20on%20pinterest%3F'>\nHow does it choose an image to share on Pinterest?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If there is an image in the content of your article, it will find the first one and use that. Otherwise, it will fall back to using the featured image. If no image is associated with the article, then Pinterest will display all of the images found on the page, allowing the user to select which they want to use.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20icons%20do%20you%20have%3F'>\nWhat icons do you have?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can choose between lossless PNG images, <a href=\"https:\/\/fontawesome.com\/?ref=socialized-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Font Awesome 5<\/a> icons, or English text. The HTML is simple so you can easily change the appearance with CSS.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20compatible%20with%20the%20yoast%20seo%20plugin%3F'>\nIs this compatible with the Yoast SEO plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! If you leave the &#8220;Campaign Term&#8221; blank in the metabox on your page, the <code>utm_term<\/code> value will default to your page&#8217;s &#8220;focus keyphrase&#8221; in Yoast SEO&#8217;s metabox.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>4.0.0<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Release Date: September 27, 2023<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated FontAwesome assets to version 6.4.2<\/li>\n<li>Updated Twitter icon to X<\/li>\n<li>Updated backend admin logo and UI to match other AuRise Creative plugins<\/li>\n<li>Overhauled plugin code to be more consistent with other AuRise Creative plugins<\/li>\n<li>Values for the checkbox\/switch plugin options are now stored as <code>1<\/code> or <code>0<\/code> instead of the strings <code>true<\/code> and <code>false<\/code>.
