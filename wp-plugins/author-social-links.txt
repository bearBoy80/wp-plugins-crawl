What it does is add in social media links to your Contact Info section in your user profile for popular social media sites such as Google Plus, Twitter and Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Once you fill in one or more of those fields, 16 x16 icons will appear next to your name when your name appears as the author of a blog post. This lets readers easily find your social media information as they read and is completely unique to each author.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Installation is really simple.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>plugin-name.php<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Update the Contact Info fields in your user profile<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>The links aren&#8217;t showing up, what&#8217;s wrong?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin relies on your theme using the the_author_posts_link function to generate the author link.
