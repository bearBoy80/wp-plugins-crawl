This plugin comes with a widget called &#8216;Emma for WordPress Subscription Form&#8217;. The Widgets are listed in alphabetical order.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode<\/strong><br \/>\n   If you would like to add the form to another area on your site, you can use the Emma shortcode. Simply type [emma_form] in the HTML view in the post editor. For more information on shortcodes, check the almighty codex: [Shortcodes](https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Shortcode&#8221; WordPress Codex &#8211; Shortcodes&#8221;).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I add members to a specific group?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve configured the plugin, and entered your account ID, Private and Public API keys, navigate from the Dashboard to Settings -&gt; Emma for WordPress. Under the \u201cAccount information\u201d tab there is a dropdown menu under \u201cAdd New Members to Group.\u201d From here, you can select the group to which new members should be added.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I set up an automated workflow using my WordPress form?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You sure can.
