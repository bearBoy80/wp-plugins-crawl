Choose a unique test id, provide a piece of code for the first group and a piece of code for the second, and define an id to indicate a conversion.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s define a split test called <strong>clothes<\/strong>. In the first group, we&#8217;ll say &#8220;Your clothes are red.&#8221; In the second group, we&#8217;ll say &#8220;Your clothes are black.&#8221; When we convert, we&#8217;ll use the id <strong>clothes_complete<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Then, we&#8217;ll do this on our test page:<\/p>\n<p>&lt;a href=&#8221;convert.php&#8221;&gt;<strong>[ab-see id=clothes]<\/strong>&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p>\n<p>And on the page we want to get to:<\/p>\n<p><strong>[ab-convert id=clothes_complete]<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it!<\/p>\n<p>Inspired by the practice of copying the smartest people you know, AB-See is based on Patrick McKenzie\u2019s A\/Bingo (http:\/\/www.bingocardcreator.com\/abingo) and Ben Kamens&#8217; GAE\/Bingo (http:\/\/bjk5.com\/post\/10171483254\/a-bingo-split-testing-now-on-app-engine-built-for).<\/p>\n<p>Built for our A\/B testing needs at Scent Trunk (https:\/\/scenttrunk.com).<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Place all the files in a directory inside of wp-content\/plugins (for example, ab-see), and activate the plugin.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Why is my test not working?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Tests are not enabled by default after being created!
