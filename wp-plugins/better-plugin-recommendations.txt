Yeah there is search but what if you don\u2019t know what you are looking for. What Better Plugin Recommendations does is remove the default featured and recommendations tab and instead adds a new recommendations tab which only included plugins that I&#8217;ve hand selected. These are plugins that I feel are appropriate for every new user and are ones that are great examples of why WordPress is awesome.<\/p>\n<p>The only purpose of this plugin is to help WordPress users find the plugins they need. There is no branding or ads. It\u2019s integrated perfectly into the Plugin -&gt; New screen.<\/p>\n<p>Saying that these are the &#8220;best&#8221; WordPress plugins isn&#8217;t really helpful. Best is so subjective. I thought it would help if you knew the criteria I used in selecting these plugins, so I&#8217;ve included it below. I&#8217;m also trying to only include plugins that I think the majority of people will use. There are definitely some great niche plugins that I think are wonderful but not useful enough for everyone to include.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the criteria I used:<\/p>\n<p>Price (Free)<br \/>\nNumbers of users<br \/>\nAverage Rating<br \/>\nLast Updated<br \/>\nSupport Given<\/p>\n<p>This plugin uses a web service to serve up the plugin results.

We also have a number of go to plugins that we use regularly.\n\nLike others in the industry, we'd love to ensure our clients use the best tools for the job, rather than a random collection of plugins of varying quality and performance. So, being able to firmly guide our clients in the direction of plugins that we know work well not only means that we help our clients keep their WP site in top condition, we can also help support our clients because they are using plugins that we have a lot of experience with, rather than some previously unheard off alternative.\n\nThanks for making this.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Makes picking a decent plugin easier.<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ipokkel\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/aac6f688af3e45eff36151c577b6b153?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/aac6f688af3e45eff36151c577b6b153?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ipokkel\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Theunis Coetzee <small>(ipokkel)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">April 28, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Just find this so handy, installing it for all my existing and future clients.
