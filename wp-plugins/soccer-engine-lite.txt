Our goal is to provide all WordPress users with a comprehensive and expandable solution for any soccer-related website.<\/p>\n<h3>Pro version<\/h3>\n<p>We distribute the <a href=\"https:\/\/daext.com\/soccer-engine\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro version<\/a> of this plugin that includes the following additional features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Additional Blocks<\/strong> like the Match Timeline, Ranking Transitions Chart, Market Value Transitions Chart, Referee Statistics by Competition, Referee Statistics by Team.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Events Wizard<\/strong> to generate multiple events in a single operation. With this feature, you can easily assign results to multiple matches without manually adding single events.<\/li>\n<li><strong>REST API<\/strong> to optionally manage the Soccer Engine data with external applications, create new additional plugin features, automatically create match events, and more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Import<\/strong> and <strong>Export<\/strong> menus to create a backup of the plugin data or move the plugin data between different WordPress installations.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Additional advanced options<\/strong> to set custom menu capabilities, customize the pagination system, and more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Publish a great variety of soccer statistics<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin gives you the ability to publish a great variety of soccer statistics on your website. These statistics are sometimes directly retrieved from records added by the website editors with the administrative menus. Other times, the plugin generates statistics based on simple or complex calculations. Examples of statistics directly retrieved from the inputted data are the first name of a player, the last name of a player, and its height. In contrast, examples of statistics calculated by the plugin are the standings tables of the competitions or statistics that report the player performance.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of elements generated in the front-end, the plugin uses regular HTML tables for the most part. However, the plugin can also generate more complex layouts when needed. To illustrate, in the case of match commentaries or to visually represent the formations, the plugin uses custom layouts augmented with images, SVG illustrations, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Below you can find a list of the blocks added to WordPress by the plugin in alphabetic order. Please note that users of the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/classic-editor\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Classic Editor<\/a>, or users with alternative visual editors can use shortcodes with parameters as a fallback for the editor blocks. For more information on the use of the shortcodes provided by Soccer Engine, visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/daext.com\/doc\/soccer-engine-lite\/#shortcodes\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">shortcodes section<\/a> of the plugin manual.<\/p>\n<h4>Agency contracts<\/h4>\n<p>This block displays a table that lists the contractual agreement between players and their agencies or sports agents.<\/p>\n<h4>Competition round<\/h4>\n<p>Use this element to display a table with information about the matches associated with a competition.<\/p>\n<h4>Competition standings table<\/h4>\n<p>With this block, you can generate a standings table that compares the teams of a round-robin competition by ranking them based on multiple criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Note that we worked to make the tournament system very flexible. For example, you can set the criteria used to rank the teams or determine the points assigned to the team&#8217;s victories, draw, and loss.<\/p>\n<h4>Injuries<\/h4>\n<p>This block allows you to display a table with information about the injuries.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin gives you the ability to list the individual injuries associated with the players and add additional information like the injury type (E.g., concussion, knee inflammation, meniscal tear, etc.), the date range on which the player was injured, and more.<\/p>\n<h4>Market value transitions<\/h4>\n<p>This block displays a table with information about the market value of players at a specific moment in time.<\/p>\n<h4>Match commentary<\/h4>\n<p>This block gives you the ability to describe the events of a match.

In addition, below each player are also shown icons used to represent the event associated with the players.<\/p>\n<h4>Matches<\/h4>\n<p>This block displays a table that lists one match per row with information like the date of the game, the hour of the game, the home team, the away team, the match result, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Note that this list is generated based on custom criteria defined with the block options. You can, for example, only display the matches played by a specific team, the games played in a specified date interval, and more.<\/p>\n<h4>Player awards<\/h4>\n<p>Use the player awards to register and display the awards received by the players. A prominent example of this feature is to list the Ballon D&#8217;Or winners. Note that you can define your custom awards in the back-end and, consequently, list awards assigned by local competitions, etc.<\/p>\n<h4>Player summary<\/h4>\n<p>This element generates information retrieved from the players and from the transfers market data. It&#8217;s a layout commonly used in &#8220;Player Profile&#8221; pages or more in general to complement pages or paragraphs dedicated to specific players.<\/p>\n<h4>Players<\/h4>\n<p>This layout generates a table that lists one player per row. The table columns, which you can customize with the block options, can display information like the age of the player, the citizenship, the player height, the market value, the current club of the player, the club that owns the player, and more.<\/p>\n<h4>Ranking transitions<\/h4>\n<p>With this block, you can display a table that lists the ranking value of the teams in a specific ranking system. An example of ranking system is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uefa.com\/nationalassociations\/uefarankings\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">UEFA club coefficients<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Based on your specific needs, you can create your custom ranking systems or report the data of existing ranking systems.<\/p>\n<h4>Referee summary<\/h4>\n<p>This block displays a referee&#8217;s image, additional information retrieved from referee data, and calculated information based on the referee&#8217;s performance on existing matches.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of computed statistics, the plugin can list the number of appearances, the overall number of yellow cards and red cards assigned by the referee, and more.<\/p>\n<h4>Squad lineup \/ Squad staff \/ Squad substitutions<\/h4>\n<p>These three blocks list the players and staff members associated with a squad.<\/p>\n<p>Note that in this plugin, the squads are reusable collections of players, staff members, formations, and jersey sets usually used to speed up the configuration of new matches.<\/p>\n<h4>Staff<\/h4>\n<p>This block displays a list of staff members with information like the staff member&#8217;s age, their citizenship, and their role. Examples of staff members are managers, assistant managers, athletic coaches, goalkeeping coaches, board members.<\/p>\n<h4>Staff awards<\/h4>\n<p>Use this block to generate a list of awards assigned to staff members.

Essential information associated with the team contracts are the contract&#8217;s start date, the contract&#8217;s end date, and the salary.<\/p>\n<p>Team contracts are always associated with a contract type, which is used to better define and categorize the team contract. Examples of contract types are purchase, loan, loan with option, etc. It&#8217;s worth noting that the plugin gives you the ability to define your custom contract types from a dedicated menu.<\/p>\n<h4>Transfers<\/h4>\n<p>This is an essential element for transfer market blogs that want to list the transfer market movement.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the block filters, you can display, for example, only the transfer market movement that took place in a specific period, the transfer market movement associated with a particular team, the transfer market movement with high fees, and more.<\/p>\n<p>In the front-end, the table generated with this block includes information such as the player name, the player citizenship, the teams involved in the transfer, the date of the transfer, the market value of the player, the fee paid to complete the transfer, and more.<\/p>\n<h4>Trophies<\/h4>\n<p>Use this block to display the trophies won by a team with information like the type of trophy or the data on which the trophy has been assigned.<\/p>\n<p>Use this feature, for example, to list the UEFA Champions League winners or to list the winners of local soccer competitions.<\/p>\n<h4>Unavailable players<\/h4>\n<p>Use this element to list the unavailable players.

So you can easily create your own unique and consistent style.<\/p>\n<h4>The events system<\/h4>\n<p>Events are the single units used to generate the match statistics. Examples of events are goals, yellow cards, red cards, and substitutions.<\/p>\n<p>By entering events, you will be able to display match commentaries, generate event tooltips with details of the events, and more. In addition, the events data allows the plugin to generate computed statistics.<\/p>\n<h4>Customizable competitions<\/h4>\n<p>The plugin allows you to create competitions of type <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Round-robin_tournament\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Round-robin<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Single-elimination_tournament\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Elimination<\/a> with a custom number of participating teams.<\/p>\n<p>These two types of competition are the foundations for any soccer tournament.
