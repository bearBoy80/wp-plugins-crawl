That&#8217;s why we built WPForms to adapt to your workflow and allow you to create custom contact forms in minutes. By using our easy to use <a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/features\/drag-drop-online-form-builder\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">drag and drop online form builder<\/a>, you can easily add custom form fields, rearrange them, and basically create a complete contact form in 5 minutes or less.<\/p>\n<p>But don&#8217;t just take our word.

My clients love WPForms and it&#8217;s one of the few plugins they can use without any training. As a developer I appreciate how fast, modern, clean and extensible it is.<br \/>\n  Bill Erickson &#8211; Expert WordPress Consultant<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h4>Pre-built Form Templates<\/h4>\n<p>Building contact forms in WordPress can be time-consuming. Why?<\/p>\n<p>Because every other WordPress contact form builder plugin requires you to build your contact form from scratch. The truth is it&#8217;s often not necessary to create a contact form completely from scratch unless you really want to.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking to create a simple contact form, marketing form, request a quote form, donation form, payment order form, registration form, or a subscription form, we have a form template for you inside our contact form builder.<\/p>\n<p>WPForms comes with <a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/features\/form-templates\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">pre-built form templates<\/a> to help you save time. You can add, remove, or re-arrange fields as necessary.<\/p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/templates\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">1100+ Pre-Made WPForms Form Template Demos<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Mobile Ready, SEO Friendly and Optimized for Speed<\/h4>\n<p>WPForms&#8217; contact forms are 100% responsive and mobile-friendly by default. We also optimized every query on the frontend and the backend to ensure maximum speed &#8211; Yes, WPForms is one of the fastest WordPress contact form plugins.<\/p>\n<p>You can embed your contact form on any page with optimized title and description. With the speed and proper formatting, WPForms is also one of the most SEO friendly contact form plugins.<\/p>\n<h4>All the Fields &amp; Features that You Need to Succeed<\/h4>\n<p>From star ratings to file uploads to multi-page contact forms with progress bars, we have all the fields you need.<\/p>\n<p>You can easily integrate your contact forms with an email marketing service or collect payments for bookings and orders. WPForms allows you to do it all.<\/p>\n<p>The best part is, you can do it all without hiring a developer.<\/p>\n<p>See what one business owner has to say about WPForms&#8217; contact form:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a business owner, time is my most valuable asset. WPForms allow me to create smart contact forms with just a few clicks. With their pre-built form templates and the drag &amp; drop builder, I can create a new form that works in less than 2 minutes without writing a single line of code. Well worth the investment.<br \/>\n  David Henzel &#8211; Co-founder of MaxCDN<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h4>Surveys &amp; Polls<\/h4>\n<p>Along with contact form, you can also use WPForms to create surveys and polls.<\/p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/addons\/surveys-and-polls-addon\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">WordPress Survey plugin addon<\/a> comes with smart survey fields including likert scale, star ratings, multiple choice, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and more, so you can create custom survey forms like Survey Monkey (without the high costs).<\/p>\n<p>WPForms offers the best-in class survey reporting. You can use our interactive reports to customize the graphs, export them for your presentations, and even display the aggregate results to your users.<\/p>\n<p>The best part about WPForms survey reports is that it can retroactively work on any old contact form or feedback survey contact form created with WPForms.<\/p>\n<p>Thousands of businesses love WPForms surveys for creating employee feedback forms, customer feedback forms, online petition forms, and more.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the Surveys &amp; Polls addon to easily create a poll on your site. To save you time when creating a user poll, we have added a built-in poll forms template. Our poll feature offers real-time reports, so you can share poll results with the user immediately after they submit their vote.<\/p>\n<p>Just like the contact form, you can embed your surveys and polls inside any post, page, or widget area in WordPress.<\/p>\n<h4>Membership and Default WordPress Forms<\/h4>\n<p>Aside from building simple contact forms that every WordPress site needs, WPForms also helps you create better default WordPress forms.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you can use WPForms to create custom WordPress login forms and custom WordPress user registration forms which are great for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wpbeginner.com\/wp-tutorials\/ultimate-guide-to-creating-a-wordpress-membership-site\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">membership sites<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For membership sites, you can also use WPForms to create a password-protected contact form or even a members only contact form that is restricted to logged-in users only.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you&#8217;re not using a WordPress membership plugin, you can use WPForms to create membership registration forms, online RSVP forms, and other address book contact forms.<\/p>\n<p>Bloggers and publishers can use our WordPress post submission forms to accept guest posts, testimonials, and partnership agreement forms to grow their businesses.<\/p>\n<h4>Payment Form, Donation Form, Booking Form, and More<\/h4>\n<p>While WPForms started out as a contact form plugin, it has evolved into a powerful custom forms solution that you can use to create a payment form, donation form, registration form, online booking form, mobile form, and basically any type of custom form you need.<\/p>\n<p>WPForms integrates with PayPal, Stripe, Square, and Authorize.Net so you can easily create a credit card payment form to accept payments. If you&#8217;re using SSL, then you can use our Stripe, Square, or Authorize.Net Payment forms to accept credit card payments directly on your website. Alternatively, you can use our PayPal Commerce addon to take payments via PayPal or credit card on your forms.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from simple order forms, business owners also use WPForms to create custom product purchase forms, t-shirt order forms, online booking forms, and more.<\/p>\n<p>We understand that sometimes you may need to create a contact form that requires a signature. WPForms comes with a signature field to collect user signatures on your WordPress forms or even create custom signature forms.<\/p>\n<p>You can do all of this while still using the same easy-to-use contact form builder that&#8217;s loved by over 6 million users.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am so impressed with this plugin. I decided to give it a shot over some of the other form plugins, and I am so glad I did. It works well, is so easy to use and customize. The support is amazing on top of it all. I got the pro version because I was so pleased. Highly recommend.<br \/>\n  Micky73 &#8211; WordPress user<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h4>Custom Calculations and Calculator Forms<\/h4>\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/addons\/calculations-addon\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">WPForms Calculations addon<\/a>, you can build custom formulas and display results to your users on the frontend. Perfect for real-time custom quotes or estimates, variable shipping calculator forms, bulk discount order forms, and so much more.<\/p>\n<p>With the formula builder, you can set up simple arithmetic calculations as well as complex conditional calculations with if\/then statements. It even supports functions to return rounded values, averages, and time ranges, just to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>The Calculations addon makes WPForms the best calculator plugin for WordPress and puts all these powerful features at your fingertips. Create more complex order forms for your eCommerce site, gather user information for lead generation, and provide valuable information to your users to improve their experience on your website.<\/p>\n<h4>Forms that are Optimized for Conversion and Results<\/h4>\n<p>With our Form Pages addon, you can create distraction-free custom form landing pages like Google Forms and Wufoo right inside WordPress, so you can increase conversions without the high costs (<a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/addons\/form-pages-addon\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">See Form Pages Demo<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>To improve form completion rate, we created Conversational Forms&reg; which helps you make your generic feedback form and other custom contact forms feel more human by adding an interactive form layout. Our conversational forms are similar to Typeform without the high subscription costs (<a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/addons\/conversational-forms-addon\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">See Conversational Forms Demo<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>WPForms also has other conversion optimization features such as our smart form logic that lets you create dynamic contact forms where fields change based on the user&#8217;s answer, multi-page contact forms with progress bars, and other advanced contact forms.<\/p>\n<p>WPForms form analytics integration with MonsterInsights allows you to easily track your lead capture forms, newsletter signup forms, request a quote contact form, and other important forms on your site.<\/p>\n<h4>Easy to Customize and Extend<\/h4>\n<p>You can easily customize your contact forms with our section dividers, HTML blocks, and custom CSS.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using Elementor or Divi page builders our native integrations let you quickly customize the style of your forms. Embedding forms in Elementor and Divi has never been easier.<\/p>\n<p>We also knew that our developer friends may want to extend simple contact forms further. That&#8217;s why WPForms come with tons of hooks and filters to create custom functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Since contact forms are essential for marketing, WPForms is a must have plugin for every website!<\/p>\n<h4>Full WPForms Feature List<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/features\/drag-drop-online-form-builder\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Online Form Builder<\/a> &#8211; Our powerful drag &amp; drop contact form builder allows you to easily create WordPress contact forms and other online forms in just a few minutes without writing any code.<\/li>\n<li>100% Responsive &#8211; Mobile Friendly contact forms.<\/li>\n<li>GDPR Friendly &#8211; Make your contact form GDPR compatible with just a few clicks.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/features\/form-templates\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Form Templates<\/a> &#8211; Use our pre-built form templates to save time.
