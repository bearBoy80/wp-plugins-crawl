Uses Wenting Zhang&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/wentin\/ResponsifyJS\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Responsify.js<\/a> to create focal points on images using jQuery.<\/p>\n<p>Works similar to a traditional ACF image field, but once an image is selected and a preview is displayed, this plugin allows drawing a box around a focal point in the image using canvas. That image can then be displayed in a nice responsified fashion. View the <a href=\"http:\/\/responsifyjs.space\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ResponsifyJs<\/a> homepage for a demo.<\/p>\n<p>Image returned as either tag or object to use within themes. Includes responsify.js.<\/p>\n<p>See Frequently Asked Questions for more info and detailed usage.<\/p>\n<p>Last tested on ACF v4 (4.4.5) &amp; ACF Pro (5.3.3.2).<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Since this a WordPress plugin just search for &#8220;ACF: Focal Point&#8221; in the plugins section in the admin and install it from there.

There&#8217;s a few differences, like not returning just an ID (there&#8217;s no point without positions), but the basics are the same.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure the Preview Size and Return Size are of a similar ratio. And make sure the image parent has a height.<\/p>\n<p>Image tag returns some additional markup on images:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;img class=\"js-focal-point-image\" src=\"img.png\" alt=\"image alt\" data-focus-left=\"0.12\" data-focus-top=\"0.11\" data-focus-right=\"0.40\" data-focus-bottom=\"0.98\"&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The Image object now has a few more values too:<\/p>\n<pre><code>'focal_point'   =&gt; array(\n    'class'     =&gt; 'js-focal-point-image',\n    'top'       =&gt; $value['top'],\n    'left'      =&gt; $value['left'],\n    'right'     =&gt; $value['right'],\n    'bottom'    =&gt; $value['bottom']\n)\n\n\n'class' refers to the class that Responsify.js is called on. This needs to be on the image tag to work.\n\n'top', 'left', 'right' and `'bottom'` refer to the `data-focus` attributes used to control focal point. \n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Build image as per above tag. Responsify is called on load and resize automatically on <code>img.js-focal-point-image<\/code>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why are the images returned huge?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure the image is wrapped inside an element that has a height and hasn&#8217;t had it&#8217;s <code>overflow: hidden<\/code> overridden (by <code>!important<\/code>). And that the image hasn&#8217;t had it&#8217;s <code>max-width: none<\/code> overridden.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why are the images returned small?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure the return image size (set when creating a Focal Point field) isn&#8217;t set to a small image size. Larger images work better.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why are the images not stretching to fill it&#8217;s container?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Responsify.js tries it&#8217;s best to fit as much of the photo in the container as it can, whilst keeping the focal point a priority, and also keeping ratios correct. This means that at some sizes\/ratios your image will be displayed too small for it&#8217;s container, try changing container size or image size. Or use <code>background-size: cover<\/code>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why are the images not scaling?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because for this to work, the image needs to move around within a container. Which means we need to hide the containers overflow. Which means we need to set a height. This is not made for wysiwyg style images, it&#8217;s for banners, sliders, fullpage, fixed height sections, etc.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why is the focus area not lining up correctly when I view the page\/post?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure that the preview size and the return size are the same ratio. It&#8217;s relatively accurate when they&#8217;re close, but for best results they should be the same. And make sure any image sizes aren&#8217;t differing their crops.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug with image not displaying on changing acf tabs.<\/li>\n<li>fixes missing class from delete icon<\/li>\n<li>fixed undefined variables<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/acf-focal-point\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1539195\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/acf-focal-point\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1539195\" alt=\"Creating a Focal Point Field.\"><\/a><p>Creating a Focal Point Field.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/acf-focal-point\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1539195\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/acf-focal-point\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1539195\" alt=\"Selecting a Focal Point for the selected image.\"><\/a><p>Selecting a Focal Point for the selected image.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/acf-focal-point\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1539195\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/acf-focal-point\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1539195\" alt=\"Desktop width image on 2016 Theme.\"><\/a><p>Desktop width image on 2016 Theme.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/acf-focal-point\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1539195\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/acf-focal-point\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1539195\" alt=\"Same image at mobile width.\"><\/a><p>Same image at mobile width.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Fantastic<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pmascis\/\"><img alt='' src='http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6c1fbda0d0906bf89833192b1926bc86?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6c1fbda0d0906bf89833192b1926bc86?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pmascis\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">pmascis<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">June 5, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Works a treat, thanks!\n\nTested and working with:\nWordPress 4.9.6\nAdvanced Custom Fields PRO 5.6.10<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great Plugin - Squarespace style focalpoint<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/justin-moreland\/\"><img alt='' src='http:\/\/2.gravatar.com\/avatar\/22fd1b41bea5c5dd56d1bcde2b80e678?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='http:\/\/2.gravatar.com\/avatar\/22fd1b41bea5c5dd56d1bcde2b80e678?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/justin-moreland\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Justin Moreland<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 23, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I was skeptical of this plugin since it had so few reviews, but it is a gem. I've always wanted something like Squarespace's focal point. This is great! I've used it on a blog for both the post preview image and using the same image for the header. It's looks great in both spots. I like that it is adaptable so it can pass an image object or just an image in the desired size.
