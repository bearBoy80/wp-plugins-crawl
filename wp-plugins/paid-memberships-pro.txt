For the past 2 vesions, we&#8217;ve been returning true in these cases, which caused PMPro to send emails to the admin when the edit use page was saved, even if there was no level change.

Since we default to the first available level, calling pmpro_getLevelForCheckout() was causing pmpro_is_checkout to return true on ALL pages. This disrupted a lot of functionality.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed warnings in the pmpro_getLevelAtCheckout() function.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where &#8220;All Time Sales&#8221; was showing up as 0, even when there were sales.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.5.8 &#8211; 2021-04-30<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added <code>pmpro_membership_content_filter<\/code> filter to let other plugins change how PMPro filters member content.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Improved de_DE email template translation.

All prices are sent through a special pmpro_escape_price function that allows div, span, and sup tags with id and class attributes. Also removed from unneeded small tags and grey coloring of prices in certain spots.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Now cancelling membership when a SUBSCRIPTION_CANCELED message is sent to the Braintree webhook handler. In the past, we incorrectly sent the payment failed email instead.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed display issues with the Require Membership block. The level select field has been swapped with a list of checkboxes.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed warnings that occurred when processing failed payments in webhook and IPN handlers.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed our Braintree class so we will only attempt to update a user&#8217;s credit card and address when the getCustomer method is called at checkout or during a billing update.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where refreshing the checkout review page when using PayPal Express caused the associated order to be updated again. Now the order status is updated to review and only updates again when the user confirms.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Avoiding warnings when the pmpro_url function is used if the PMPro pages haven&#8217;t been set up yet. (Thanks, Thomas Sjolshagen)<\/li>\n<li>REFACTOR: Updated the pmpro_getSpecificMembershipLevelForUser( $user_id, $level_id ) function so both fields are required.

This hook should now be used to add billing related settings.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Allowing order total to be set to 0, even if there is a subtotal and tax amount.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Stripe checkout fields will now use the language set in the Stripe settings.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: The URL check in our notifications code now accepts arrays (e.g. to see if a URL has one of a group of top level domains). This fixes a warning some may have seen in error logs.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issues where totals on PayPal recurring payments were sometimes incorrect if both an mt_gross and amount field were passed via IPN.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.5.4 &#8211; 2021-01-28<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Bump license year 2021 &#8211; 10 years.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Now passing billing street in <code>pmpro_tax<\/code> filter.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Prefixed our pmpro_stripeResponseHandler function to avoid conflicts.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added getRealPaymentTransactionId method to PayPal Express gateway class to recover a missing transaction ID.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added <code>pmpro_checkout_before_form<\/code> action to hook anything before the membership checkout form.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added avatar as a valid field type for the [pmpro_member] shortcode.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Changed license key field to text type and unmasked. Masking implied the key was hashed before saving which is not true.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added<code>pmpro_discount_code_used<\/code> action hook for when a discount code is used.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Stripe will now pull billing address info for recurring orders from webhooks.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Improved user interface, error handling, and messages in the frontend password reset process.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Added a space between state and zip code in billing info.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Now rounding amount sent with Stripe payment request button.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Improved <code>pmpro_check_plugin_version<\/code> function to also check a specific value of the <code>get_plugin_data<\/code> array.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Added <code>pmpro_membership_levelmeta<\/code> and <code>pmpro_membership_ordermeta<\/code> tables to uninstall process.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Escaped things in SQL queries in 2Checkout INS service handler.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Cleaned up levels page template and added MMPU compatibility.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed pagination and export issues with a discount code filter on the Orders admin page.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Prefixed our <code>pmpro_stripeResponseHandler<\/code> function to avoid conflicts with other Stripe code that may not be prefixed.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Cleaned up conditionals and escaping improvements in the <code>pmpro_redirect_to_logged_in<\/code> function.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed deprecation notices for sites running PHP 8.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Improved SQL query format in the applydiscountcode service.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issues with ReCAPTCHA v2 and certain gateways.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed bug where blog name was not showing in Admin Activity email.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Improved incorrect PHP doc blocks.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed an issue on some sites where password reset link in email was incorrect.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed level change issues during 2Checkout checkout.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where <code>checkout_levels<\/code> REST API endpoint could return the wrong initial payment<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed undefined notice for timestamp variable in the Stripe gateway class.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Avoiding warnings when user ids are in the memberships_users table, but a user doesn&#8217;t exist.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Now setting the correct value for membership_id in the admin change emails.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.5.3 &#8211; 2021-01-26<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>SECURITY: Fixed indirect object reference vulnerability where order information, including customer names, email addresses, and order numbers could be accessed by non-admin WordPress users. (Thanks, WP Plugins Team)<\/li>\n<li>SECURITY: Now checking ReCAPTCHA validation before enabling the submit button on the checkout form when using ReCAPTCHA v2. This helps to keep bad actors from testing credit cards on your checkout page. We were already doing a similar check when using ReCAPTCHA v3. Further updates to rate limit credit card failures are planned.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.5.2 &#8211; 2020-10-23<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where the RECAPTCHA library wasn&#8217;t being loaded early enough to validate at checkout.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where code in the Stripe class was unsetting some required fields, even if Stripe was not being used at checkout.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.5.1 &#8211; 2020-10-16<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>SECURITY: Fixed XSS vulnerability on the Members List page of the dashboard.

Enable this feature from the payment settings page.<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Added Divi Builder compatibility.<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Updated the Braintree Gateway class to be able to use the Braintree API for the pmpro_next_payment() function. Note, for performance reasons, you must call this method directly or enable it by hooking it up with code like <code>add_filter('pmpro_next_payment', array('PMProGateway_braintree', 'pmpro_next_payment'), 10, 3);<\/code><\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Added ordermeta tables and functions. We will wait about a year for all users to upgrade before using these widespread. (Thanks, Mirco Babini)<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: The &#8220;short&#8221; version of the level cost text for a free level is now &#8220;Free&#8221; instead of &#8220;0.00 now&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added a <code>get_original_subscription_order<\/code> method to the MemberOrder class. This will return the first order in a subscription when called from a recurring order.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Removed the old style license nags.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Using microtime and a static counter int to make sure our order and discount codes are unique. In the past very high traffic sites could run into duplicates if two checkouts happened at the exact same second.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Adjust order delete prompt to support other locales.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Better handling of tax amounts in recurring payments, e.g. when using the PMPro VAT Tax add on.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Optimized how often we hit the Stripe API when events on the checkout page could potentially update the price of checkout.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: The checkout_levels api call now takes <code>level<\/code> as param.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: No longer running sanitize_text_field on password fields. This would break passwords that had strings of characters resembling html tags.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Now warning admins if the Stripe billing period is longer than 1 year. Billing periods greater than 1 year are not allowed by Stripe.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Now detecting when a Stripe webhook is set up for an older version of the Stripe API and showing a notice with a link to update.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Adding MAXFAILEDPAYMENTS=1 to PayPal add subscription requests. This tells PayPal to cancel a subscription after the first failed payment. In our experience, the automatic retries rarely worked well. This change fixes issues with subscriptions going out of sync or users retaining access to your site when their payment has failed. Members still receive the payment failed email, which prompts users to return to the site to renew.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Fixing some issues where we are adding extra break tags into the password reset email. There are still some issues like this when using certain plugins. We are working on a general fix.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Removed the &#8220;coupon amount&#8221; field from the edit order page. These were hold outs from the 2007! ecommerce plugin PMPro was forked from.

This fixes issues with iThemes Security 2FA.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issues where the Stripe webhook was not being updated sometimes when clicking the button to update.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed some notices and warnings when using Braintree.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Now resetting memberslist page number when changing shown level.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Now ensuring that the discount code field updates, update the Request Button price.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where non-pretty permalinks may break frontend password resets.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed invoice links on the account page. (Thanks, Mateusz Ho\u0142tyn)<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed incorrect label &#8220;for&#8221; attribute for uninstall setting.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where some free plugins distributed by PMPro would show warnings about requiring a Plus license.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.4.4 &#8211; 2020-09-02<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed fatal error that sometimes occurred on the payment settings page when using PHP 5.6 or earlier.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed fatal errors that showed up on the frontend invoice page.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where the confirmation message was not showing up in the confirmation email if that option was checked.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added a pmpro_stripe_charge_params filter that can be used to edit or add params sent to the Stripe create charge method. (Thanks, Michael Bester)<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Tweaked the markup of the invoice page so the payment type information looks a little better.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>= 2.4.3 &#8211; 2020-08-25<br \/>\n* SECURITY: Fixed a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the code that updates the Required Membership settings on a post. This vulnerability could have been used in conjunction with other security vulnerabilities to trick an admin into editing the membership settings for a page, potentially exposing members only content to non-members. It is unlikely that there was any active exploitation of this vulnerability. This issue may also have shown up as a bug on some sites using page builders, where the membership settings for a post would be cleared out when editing a post. (Thanks to the wp.org plugin review team for catching this issue.)<br \/>\n* SECURITY: Better escaping of variables shown in the Require Membership meta box and related SQL queries.<br \/>\n* BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Renamed the Vietnamese language files to match what is expected.<\/p>\n<p>= 2.4.2 &#8211; 2020-08-24<br \/>\n* SECURITY: Updated the PMPro REST API endpoints accessed via the GET method to also require appropriate capabilities to access. The membership confirmation text will be hidden from non-members and non-admins. The endpoints to check a user&#8217;s level or access to a post require the pmpro_edit_memberships capability now. You should make sure your API users have the appropriate capabilities to use the API. You can use the pmpro_rest_api_route_capabilities filter and\/or pmpro_rest_api_permissions filter to change this behavior.<br \/>\n* BUG FIX: Fixed issues with the PMPro REST API endpoints, including the discount code and checkout level endpoints.<br \/>\n* BUG FIX: Fixed issue with backslashes in the display name when editing form the PMPro frontend profile page.<br \/>\n* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where timestamps were showing up incorrectly for recent orders shown on the dashboard page.<br \/>\nBUG FIX: Fixed issue where PMPro would always try to add capabilities to the administrator role, even if you removed that role for some reason.<br \/>\n* ENHANCEMENT: Added a pmpro_get_no_access_message() function, which can be used to show the no access messages.<br \/>\n* ENHANCEMENT: Added a &#8220;show_noaccess&#8221; property to the membership shortcode. When set, it will show the noaccess message to users who don&#8217;t have the levels specified.<br \/>\n* ENHANCEMENT: Added a pmpro_user_profile_update_errors hook, which can be used to show errors on the PMPro frontend profile page.<br \/>\n* ENHANCEMENT: The pmpro_set_capabilities_for_role() function now returns true or false if the caps were added in case others want to use this function and tell if it worked.<br \/>\n* ENHANCEMENT: You can now include links in the description of the fields you add to the PMPro advanced settings page via the pmpro_custom_advanced_settings filter.<br \/>\n* ENHANCEMENT: Updated the PayPal gateways to use the latest versions of the PayPal buttons.<br \/>\n* ENHANCEMENT: Fixed styling of the PMPro update script notice.<br \/>\n* ENHANCEMENT: Added the pmpro_account_membership_expiration_text filter to the expiration dates shown on the cancel page when using MMPU.<\/p>\n<h4>2.4.1 &#8211; 2020-08-10<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issues with password resets on WP Engine hosting due to security features added by their mu-plugin.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where end dates were showing up incorrectly in the confirmation email sometimes.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where renewing memberships were extended one day less than they should have been in some cases.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where users without a PMPro Plus license were sometimes not getting an error when trying to update a Plus Add On.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Added compatibility for core auto-updates for our Add Ons which aren&#8217;t hosted in the .org repository.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed issue where PHP sessions were set up to track ReCAPTCHA even if you weren&#8217;t using ReCAPTCHA. ReCAPTCHA is now only loaded on the checkout page. Loading sessions unecessarily would break some Varnish cache setups.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Updated the single invoice\/order page. No longer showing the end date, which isn&#8217;t really related to the order. Showing a better status related to the order now.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed some links to the PMPro site in the plugin admin area.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Now saving a hash of the Stripe secretkey when saving webhook ids. This allows us to keep track of webhook ids if you switch between gateway environments or swap your Stripe keys for some reason.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: No longer running the Terms of Service text through wpautop. This usually just added extra spacing to your TOS. Shortcodes are rendered now though. Added a filter pmpro_tos_content so you can change the TOS content or how it is shown.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added a checkout_levels API endpoint. This will allow us to build features that adjust the price on the frontend at checkout.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added a pmpro_member_profile_edit_form_tag action to the form tag on the frontend member profile page. This is useful to set the form enctype for file uploads.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added Romanian Leu as a currency option.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added the pmpro_stripe_payment_intent_params filter. Useful if you would like to set a specific statement descriptor for the site. See https:\/\/gist.github.com\/ideadude\/16983fdfa0da12fc40ef36d870f4cbd0<\/li>\n<li>REFACTOR: Removed some unused methods from the Stripe class.<\/li>\n<li>REFACTOR: Removed the help pointer about the menu location change.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.4 &#8211; 2020-07-24<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Now detecting if the Stripe webhook is set up correctly. You can now create or disable the webhook from the payment settings page in the WP admin dashboard.<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Added a link to use and set up SendWP for more reliable email sending from WP.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed further issues with dates and timezones.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where reports would cause white screens on some server set ups. We had some report start dates set to 1960, which caused issues. (Thanks, Sam &#8220;gausam&#8221; on GitHub)<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue with the query to find expiring memberships that happened on certain MySQL setups.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue that was caused if other code called wp_login_url() too early.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed an error in the is_login_page() function.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed a fatal error that was happening in PHP 5.2 or earlier due to code syntax that was not supported then. We noticed a few other cases as well, but decided we won&#8217;t support PHP 5.2 consistent with WP and other plugins.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed the URL used when using 2Checkout in sandbox mode.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed JavaScript errors that would occur sometimes on the Billing Update page when using the Stripe gateway.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where the dummy $0 orders created when using the &#8220;Stripe Updates&#8221; feature weren&#8217;t saving with the updated subscription_transaction_id. This would prevent future payments from being linked to that user and could prevent subscriptions cancellations from being synchronized. When updating to PMPro 2.4, an update script will run to try to restore these subscription_transaction_id values. However, any recurring orders that occured when the id was missing will not be added to PMPro. You will have to update them manually.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed JavaScript error on the edit discount code page.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Showing expiration date as text when it is set as a readonly field. (Thanks, Rodmar &#8220;rodmarzavala&#8221; on GitHub)<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Now checking if headers were already sent before trying to start the PHP session. If headers are sent before PMPro tries to start the session, there is usually another error somewhere on the WP site that needs to be fixed. But at least we aren&#8217;t adding to the confusion by trying to start the session late causing another error in the log.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Updated misleading hint for the PayPal Express IPN URL on the payment settings page.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed invalid key description in the SQL in includes\/setup.sql. The actually query used to set up table in PMPro was correct though. The setup.sql file is included for reference and developers who want to create the tables &#8220;manually&#8221; in MySQL.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: The post type search filter now supports cases where post type set in WPQuery is an array.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed warning that showed when a user with no levels visited the frontend account page.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Fixing warnings that would be logged at checkout in certain cases.<\/li>\n<li>BUG FIX\/ENHANCEMENT: Better handling of cases where users who checked out using a gateway different from the current setting are shown a message that they cannot update their billing information. They should instead checkout again to renew their membership.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Updated to use the latest version of the Stripe API and SDK.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: More detailed logging for Braintree webhook debug emails.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added a getTransactionStatus method to the PayPal and PayPal Express payment gateway classes. (Thanks, Mirco Babini)<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added a checkout_level API call. This will be used in the future to update the price total at checking using JS and is also needed to implement support for Google Pay and Apple Pay through Stripe.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Cleaned up the email settings page.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Better handling of some login and password reset errors.<\/li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added links to the PMPro YouTube and Facebook profiles.<\/li>\n<li>REFACTOR: Cleaned up some code in incldues\/content.php, especially around the pmpro_search_filter() function.<\/li>\n<li>REFACTOR: Removed the package-lock.json file from the repository.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/paid-memberships-pro\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2948997\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/paid-memberships-pro\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2948997\" alt=\"Membership levels or Pricing page to showcase your subscription plans.\"><\/a><p>Membership levels or Pricing page to showcase your subscription plans.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/paid-memberships-pro\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2948997\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/paid-memberships-pro\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2948997\" alt=\"Set up the membership levels that best fit your business, whether they are Free, Paid, or Subscriptions (Annual, Monthly, Weekly, Daily).

I purchased and installed PMPro thinking this was going to be a cakewalk for adding registered and paid members to a client's website. It was not a cakewalk. I was not looking to do anything their sales docs didn't describe. I didn't need customizations. I just needed a plugin that worked out of the box the way the sales docs described. I didn't get that. Here is what I did get ...<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">OVERALL\u20143 out of 5 Starts: Were I to do this again, I would NOT buy this plugin, I'd go elsewhere. Tepid support seemed offended that I was pointing out bugs THEY created. No one seemed to want to admit that their plugin lacked a register \/ signup form that was reCAPTCHA and Social OAuth \"aware\". After 12 years, it feels like this company is now run by a bunch of people who no longer care nor are they interested in building the best, but just a group of junior devs who come to work everyday to collect a paycheck. I messaged their founder, Jason, no reply. Crickets.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">PRO: GREAT FEATURES\u2014Where this product really shines is in its breadth of features. It does what they say in terms of restricting content, albeit, sometimes badly, but it will work.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">CON: OVERPRICED\u2014The $400 price tag is steep and recurring for all the features. It's a good value compared to having to hire a decent programmer to do this for you. Way overpriced. They do offer 3 tiers of pricing, but the free version is so limited as to be next to worthless. It's merely a way for you to install and get hooked into upgrading with features you're really going to need to make the thing work at all. Feels like bait and switch to me.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">CON: ATROCIOUS CODEBASE\u2014Looking under the hood to make some template customizations and fix their bugs made my software engineering hair stand on end! This is amateur code created by junior to mid-level people. This codebase needs a serious update.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">CON: FRAGMENTED DOCS\u2014There are a boatload of docs for the plugin, but they are piecemealed and fragmented. Yes, the search feature on the support part of their website is good, but it still took me days to find the features I needed.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">PRO: VERY EXTENSIBLE\u2014The website offers a boatload of drop in or easily configurable \"code recipes\" that allow you to change how the plugin behaves. These are super-awesome for programmer types like me, but might be way over the head of your typical WP user. Lots of hooks to play with if you know what you're doing.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">MEH: SUPPORT\u2014I opened 4 support tickets with them and got reasonably speedy responses. Had this plugin been better coded and had a better \"happy path\" to install and configure, I would not have needed to open any support tickets. The support tickets I opened should not have been necessary. Then the support kept telling me to hire a developer to fix the issue.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">CON: NO REGISTER FORM\u2014OMG! How do you have a membership plugin that doesn't have its own embedded register \/ signup form? This is a serious oversight and one the company needs to fix. Yes, they do have add-on you have to pay for, but this should be in their free version. I had to install a \"code recipe\" to get the Signup add-on to work with the Social add-on. Big oversight.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">CON: ADD-ONS NOT \"AWARE\" OF EACH OTHER\u2014When you install their Social Login add-on, their Signup add-on should be aware that it needs to show the Register \/ Login with Google, or whatever OAuth providers you configure. They are aware sometimes, but the Signup plugin was not showing the SSO for Google. And when I asked the support guy about it, he said they have no plans to add Social to their Signup add-on. Big mistake they do not intend to fix.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">CON: BUGS\u2014After 12 years, you would think that even the most basic of bugs would be taken care of. Nope. The plugin is buggy as the add-ons do not seem to play well other plugins within their code base. Very annoying. The support staff actually pointed me to their GitHub repo to merge a PR (pull request) to fix their code. Listen people, NO ONE outside of a developer is going to know what this even means. Fix your code yourselves and push out the updates pronto. Good God!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">CON: NO USER TEMPLATES\u2014There is no way that I could find buried in their docs to easily change how a form is arranged or displayed. A user should be able to edit a template that doesn't get destroyed when the software updates. MAJOR oversight.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">CON: ATROCIOUS FORM LAYOUTS\u2014The form layouts are dated and written by people who did not know modern Bootstrap layouts. Spans embedded within header tags, JS scripts massaging the UI and causing \"FOUC\" really needs to be updated. If you want your site to look awful, just use their stock templates. I had to write whole JS plugins and deep CSS to fix their oversights.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">CONCLUSION: I spent 3 days going back and forth with support to configure this monstrosity. This should not have been necessary had the plugin not been buggy and been designed by real software engineers who cared. I didn't need customizations, I just needed it to work out of the box as advertised. It did not work as advertised. This review is borne out of the frustration I had with the product and the company's lack-luster support. They need to fix both. But they won't. It's probably the reason they have competitors chomping at their heels now eroding their marketshare. Time to step it up guys. You're getting lazy. But you don't care ...<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Fantastic Membership Tool<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/patrick-b\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9a5947d96004d05a77117a15e68fbae2?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9a5947d96004d05a77117a15e68fbae2?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/patrick-b\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Patrick Boehner <small>(Patrick B)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 27, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">PMPRO is a reliable and robust membership system with excellent support.
