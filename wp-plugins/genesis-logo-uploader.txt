You basically use WordPress Customizer, upload your logo, and your done.<\/p>\n<p>It actually adds an image rather than an h1 tag and a background image, and also creates the class .site-logo.  Since Genesis 2.0 images are responsive, it\u2019ll fill the space it\u2019s in.  Meaning if you want it to shrink, you\u2019ll have to adjust the width of the container in your css.<\/p>\n<p>This is for Genesis 2.0 and up.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p><strong>NOTE:<\/strong> Only works with Genesis Framework version 2.0 or higher as the parent theme.

A lot of themes use the Custom Header theme support, so you have to make sure that\u2019s removed from your functions.php file.  Also, a lot of themes use logos as background image, so in the CSS, under .site-title (or similar), there may be be an attribute called \u2018text-indent\u2019.  Remove that.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why didn\u2019t you include styles to make the logo appear nice?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because every logo is different. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to have a default style for a rectangle logo if you\u2019re logo is round, etc. Adding a little padding, width, and margin in the style sheet should make every logo appear fine.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the logo link to use site_url() instead of \u2018\/\u2018 <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Official WordPress Release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Works great if you follow the instructions<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/cybergrace\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d05b05be7f23d258b2742671f1d84fd4?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d05b05be7f23d258b2742671f1d84fd4?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/cybergrace\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">cybergrace<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>Folks the message \"Oh No!! You have custom_header activated in your functions.php. Open that file and remove:<br \/>\nadd_theme_support( 'custom-header' );\" does not mean \"trash your file.\"<\/p>\n<p>1. Open up functions.php via your FTP program or a web editor (not a word processing program)<br \/>\n2. Notice the lines with a hashtag (#), these are explanatory lines for the lines coming afterwards. In other words, putting a hashtag (#) at the beginning of a line of code stops the code from working<br \/>\n3. Look carefully at functions.php. You will see a couple lines where it says:<br \/>\nadd_theme_support( SOMETHING OTHER THAN 'custom-header')<br \/>\nSo, do NOT delete these or put hashtags in front of that code<br \/>\n4. Patiently find the EXACT line of code:<br \/>\nadd_theme_support( 'custom-header' );<br \/>\n5. Put a hashtag at the beginning of the line (and the couple lines after it if you want, they are a connected little blob of code)<br \/>\n6. Save (not as a word processing file or functions.php.txt, just plain old functions.php<br \/>\n(if you do not know how to do this then learn that before you even think of editing any plug ins)<br \/>\n7. Presto! You can now upload a logo (assuming you turned on \"use an image logo instead of text-based logo in GENESIS --&gt; THEME SETTINGS --&gt; HEADER --&gt; choose \"Site Title\/Logo\")<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your time writing this cool plugin, Jonathan!
