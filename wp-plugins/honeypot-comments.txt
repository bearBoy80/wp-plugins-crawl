Instead, activate this plugin and let a simple hidden honeypot input field catch spam bots, which will fill out all fields in the form (even our hidden honeypot field). If that honeypot field isn&#8217;t empty, the comment won&#8217;t process, effectively nuking most spam comments.<\/p>\n<p>I also made sure that the <strong>id<\/strong> of the field is utilizing a random string of letters and numbers every time the page is loaded (ie: <em>34rscsDW37g8gf<\/em>) so that spam bots can&#8217;t target a specific id name in order to bypass it, making it harder for the bots to win.<\/p>\n<p>Installation is dead simple, just activate the plugin and you&#8217;re done.
