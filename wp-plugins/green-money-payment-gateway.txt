For over a week and a half, Green.Money has been verifying and processing fraudulent checks that came into our bank. After a few days, money was taken from my account and checks bounced. Due to Green Payment Processing's terrible e-check service and checking our bank statements, we were able to supply the product to our customers. Not even a name or a phone number had been confirmed by them, and we had no idea that they did. They say they'll take responsibility if a verified check bounces, but I have email confirmation that the checks were verified, and they don't. In fact, they charged us a return fee, a purchasing fee, on orders that were never cleared. They claimed to take responsibility. Our third-party merchant sent us fraudulent checks, but Green Payment Processing still paid them over $4,000 in fees. Because they had the audacity to charge us processing and sales fees on a fictitious order, Green.Money was the only one who benefited from the fraudulent transaction. In other words, Green.Money clearly exploits its users. They immediately closed and deleted the account after we showed them the bounced fraudulent checks that came from them.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Rock solid plug-in!

It works as advertised and all of our web development clients absolutely love it. \n\nI own an eCommerce web development consultancy in Denver, Colorado USA. KJ Proweb is the name my company. I'm posting this honest 3rd party review because we have close to 80or 90 very happy eCommerce sellers using Green.Money. \n\nWe build websites for merchants selling CBD, kratom, delta-8\/9, hemp flower and pre-rolls (with high THC content). Green.Money's plugin and pay acceptance solution was a life saver. \n\nOne Last Thing\nI carefully read three negative reviews below. They're trying to blame a software plug-in and payment processors for financial losses when it's actually the result of fraudulent purchase attempts on the part of the buyer! It happens everyday all day. \n\nIn other words, a buyer may enter their banking details into the system to complete a purchase. You notice a \"new sale\" on the books for the day and get excited. But wait a minute. If the buyer doesn't have money in the bank account the transaction will fail! Then, you have NSF fees to deal with (and that's the buyer's fault not the processor). Don't blame the processor when it's actually shady customers trying to buy your products or services without money in bank. That's unfair and crazy. And you don't experience \"charge-backs\" with this service. Not ever. It's impossible.\n\nHappy selling and enjoy the Green.Money plugin.\n\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Scam Company<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/questforbar\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3376096500f18e8df34d81085d3b3e42?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3376096500f18e8df34d81085d3b3e42?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/questforbar\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">questforbar<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 18, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">If you like being charged for a service that you don't use then choose this fraudulent company.
