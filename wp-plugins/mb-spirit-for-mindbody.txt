view and clients who were paying cash at the door, the support team added what I needed (and better!) within just a few hours. My fitness studio saw a huge increase in class sign-ins once we implemented the seamless MB Spirit website and eliminated the interstitial pages and jumpy navigation of MindBody itself.  On the tech side, it took zero effort to add my schedules to my WP site in the footer, in pages, and within the body of any post; Facebook integration was equally carefree. You have total control over your schedule display with this plugin - choose to display just the days you have classes, just classes for the next 3 days, or whatever view will help your studio thrive.  In short, this plugin works <em>for<\/em> your business, rather than your business having to work around software limitations.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Complete Best Mind Body API Powerful Plug-In<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/motogeek\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7b87a35e27032a15f15acc391c8dee8f?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7b87a35e27032a15f15acc391c8dee8f?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/motogeek\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">motogeek<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 1, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I evaluated a lot of plugins for this need. This is the best one by far! So glad I found this plugin, the initial settings screen in your word press will look like a lot but just be patient and go through the steps to get the API connected as you only need a few steps to get going (was about 5 minutes to get setup). We initially were going to create a custom API, but MB Spirit did all the work already and super easy to use. The widget API visual creator is top notch and allows you to select what you want, filter, hide from Mind Body software to show on your website. It allows visitors to purchase and register for our Mind Body classes and products through our website. The support when needed to answer a couple questions was a quick friendly response. There is a free trial. We did the trial and then signed up for a year it worked so well and easy to use for future functionality in our site as it grows. Thank you so much for this plugin! Huge time saver for our web team!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Wow Great Support<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mimmo_l\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/4e4f286242e7d11d1fb49954b85748e6?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/4e4f286242e7d11d1fb49954b85748e6?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mimmo_l\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">mimmo_l<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>The plugin offers an easy way to integrate mindbody features  into the website.

Glad I found your plugin\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.1.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1370857","caption":"Settings Manager"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1370859","caption":"Media Icon to add shortcodes to any page or post"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1370862","caption":"Widget Selector view"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1370863","caption":"Widget customization options with preview of widget presentation"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1370865","caption":"Shortcode format - additional settings can be added here and you can also adjust the layout if you used an open shortcode tag"},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=1370868","caption":"Rendered class schedule from injected shortcode"},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=1370869","caption":"Example of schedule presentation within a different web site design"},"8":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/screenshot-8.png?rev=1370870","caption":"Rendered event listing from injected shortcode"},"9":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/screenshot-9.png?rev=1370871","caption":"Example of event listing within a different web site design"},"10":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/screenshot-10.png?rev=1370874","caption":"MB Spirit dashboard with quick access to widget code and analytics"},"11":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/screenshot-11.png?rev=1370876","caption":"MB Spirit dashboard widget builder with additional options for content elements and layout"},"12":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/screenshot-12.png?rev=1370880","caption":"MB Spirit dashboard widget preview"}},"tags":{"api":"api","classes":"classes","mindbody":"MINDBODY","schedule":"schedule","staff":"staff"},"versions":{"1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.1.zip","1.0.10":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.10.zip","1.0.11":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.11.zip","1.0.12":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.12.zip","1.0.13":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.13.zip","1.0.14":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.14.zip","1.0.18":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.18.zip","1.0.19":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.19.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.2.zip","1.0.20":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.20.zip","1.0.21":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.21.zip","1.0.22":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.22.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.3.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.4.zip","1.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.5.zip","1.0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.6.zip","1.0.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.7.zip","1.0.9":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.0.9.zip","1.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.1.1.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1370855","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mb-spirit-for-mindbody\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1370856"}}
