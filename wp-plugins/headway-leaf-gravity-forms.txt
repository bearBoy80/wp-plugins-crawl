Gravity Forms gives you the ability to utilize conditional form fields and provides email notification routing. Some of the other amazing features of Gravity Forms are form Scheduling so your form only shows up when you want it to. You can also limit form entries when you want to run a contest and stop it at a certain number.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about Gravity Forms, <a href=\"http:\/\/headwaythemes.com\/go\/gravity-forms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">click here<\/a>.  You must have Gravity Forms for this Leaf to work.<\/p>\n<p>Since we at Headway Themes believe Gravity Forms is one of the most valuable plugins for WordPress currently available, we have decided to push the envelope even farther and make a leaf that works directly with Gravity Forms. The Gravity Forms leaf allows you to place a form anywhere you wish with the utmost ease.<\/p>\n<p>Seeing that most of the features lay in Gravity Forms itself, the Gravity Forms leaf is relatively simple. It consists of 3 options: the form to be displayed, whether or not to display the form title, and the form description.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin requires <a href=\"http:\/\/headwaythemes.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Headway Themes<\/a> to be installed and activated for it to work.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>headway-leaf-gravity-forms<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Remember that you need to have Headway Theme installed and activated to  use this plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Want support for this?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please direct all support questions to the Headway Themes Support <a href=\"http:\/\/headwaythemes.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">forums<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/headway-leaf-gravity-forms\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1573780\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/headway-leaf-gravity-forms\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1573780\" alt=\"screenshot-1.png.\"><\/a><p>screenshot-1.png.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/headway-leaf-gravity-forms.1.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/headway-leaf-gravity-forms\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1573780","caption":"screenshot-1.png."}},"tags":{"gravity-forms":"gravity forms","headway":"headway","headway-theme":"headway theme","headway-themes":"headway themes","leaf":"leaf"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/headway-leaf-gravity-forms.1.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/headway-leaf-gravity-forms.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/example.com\/","banners":[]}
