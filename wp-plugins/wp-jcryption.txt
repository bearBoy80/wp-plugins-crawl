This plugin encrypts submitted<br \/>\ndata in a way similar to https transmission.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Does this plugin encrypts transmission of my site pages entirely?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The plugin encrypts only data being posted from most important forms<br \/>\n(that contain password fields: login, reset password, user profile)<br \/>\nand forms you specify additionally. To secure all incoming and<br \/>\noutgoing traffic of your site a SSL certificate is needed.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I have SSL certificate installed on my site already.
