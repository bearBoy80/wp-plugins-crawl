Most API providers require an API key of some sort (similar to a username and password) to ensure that only authorized people are able to use their services.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What info is sent or received?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you install the plugin and enter your API ID and key, your WordPress site will contact the Robly API, asking for all the lists you have set up in your account. You are then able to choose certain lists to which contact form submissions are added, and those choices are saved in your WordPress options.<\/li>\n<li>When somebody submits a contact form, WordPress will contact the Robly API and search for that email address in your Robly account. If found, it will update their information according to the settings you specified; otherwise, it will create a new contact with the contact information and add them to the list(s) you selected.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I have a hard-coded HTML field and it doesn\u2019t show up in the list of fields; what do I do?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click the \u201cAdd a custom field\u201d button at the bottom of the Robly settings section.<\/li>\n<li>In the \u201cCustom Field Name\u201d field, enter the <code>name<\/code> attribute of your custom field.<\/li>\n<li>Choose the Robly field(s) for the custom field and save the contact form.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.2.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update documentation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a bunch of PHP undefined index issues for new installations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix issue preventing form submission if no sublists are set for that form<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update readme<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix some sublist and field caching issues if credentials not set on first run<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add support for custom fields<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix some array bugs<\/li>\n<li>Ignore more field types that don\u2019t make sense for Robly data fields<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Major upgrade<\/li>\n<li>Add individual form and field settings to capture all data<\/li>\n<li>Add option to ignore a form<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Check for email address in submitted data<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve debugging<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add GitHub Plugin Updater URL<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial plugin<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/cf7-robly\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1410362\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/cf7-robly\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1410362\" alt=\"Settings screen\"><\/a><p>Settings screen<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/cf7-robly\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1410362\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/cf7-robly\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1410362\" alt=\"Per-form settings\"><\/a><p>Per-form settings<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/cf7-robly\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1410362\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/cf7-robly\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1410362\" alt=\"Custom fields\"><\/a><p>Custom fields<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Real saver for me<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/billrodgers\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/749391fdcf17e60fd572bf1bc274bbe8?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/749391fdcf17e60fd572bf1bc274bbe8?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/billrodgers\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\"> <small>(BillRodgers)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>Robly allows one return\/thanks URL but we wanted to be able to track each form and create goals in Google. Between those two problems we were not able to use Robly's form builder or pop up forms.<\/p>\n<p>Using Contact Form 7 in conjunction with this excellent plugin we were able to overcome both our hurdles. Bonus is that it really easy to set up. Once you are connected to Robly this plugin pulls in all your lists and you choose the fields. Easier to use than main Contact Form 7 even.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of this review, I don't see very many downloads of this add on but that's because Robly isn't as popular as some of the other list\/newsletter software such as Mail Chimp. But someone using Robly, this plugin does a great job and for me is a life saver.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/cf7-robly.1.2.5.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/cf7-robly\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1410362","caption":"Settings screen"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/cf7-robly\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1410362","caption":"Per-form settings"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/cf7-robly\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1410362","caption":"Custom fields"}},"tags":{"cf7":"cf7","contact-form":"contact form","contact-form-7":"contact form 7","form":"form","forms":"forms"},"versions":{"1.2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/cf7-robly.1.2.1.zip","1.2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/cf7-robly.1.2.2.zip","1.2.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/cf7-robly.1.2.3.zip","1.2.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/cf7-robly.1.2.4.zip","1.2.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/cf7-robly.1.2.5.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/cf7-robly.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/cash.me\/$AndrewRMinionDesign","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/cf7-robly\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=1410362","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/cf7-robly\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=1410362"}}
