It uses all available security measures to prevent fraudulent transactions and ensure data safety yet it\u2019s easy to integrate with merchants\u2019 systems.<br \/>\nIn addition, it allows merchants to review and manage transactions, prepare reports, etc. through a user-friendly, intuitive administration interface.Another feature the plugin offers, is the ability for the merchant to define a prefix value that will be appended in the order id that is sent to JCCgateway.<\/p>\n<p>All orders sent to JCC for processing by the e-shop will have that prefix.<br \/>\nIt can be used when logging in to merchant admin console of JCC to identify from which e-shop does the order come, when merchant has multiple e-shops.
