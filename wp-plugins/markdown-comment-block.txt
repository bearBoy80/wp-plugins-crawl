While I do love Iceberg, once I publish an article I typically bring back the default Gutenberg experience \u2014 thus removing any comments I previously added.<\/p>\n<p>Having the ability to add, and keep, any relevant editing comments within my posts, without rendering them on the front-end, means that I am freed up to mentally jot any idea down without thinking about it. It is simply natural and convenient.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/richtabor.com\/markdown-comments\/?utm_source=wp-org&amp;utm_medium=markdown-comment-block&amp;utm_campaign=readme-learnmore\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn more about Markdown Comment &rarr;<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s interesting about Markdown Comment:<\/h3>\n<h4>1. Editor only<\/h4>\n<p>The block only renders within the editor. For developers reading this, that means there\u2019s no save function. I don\u2019t want my unfinished ideas, reminders, and notes rendered within my post &#8211; even if they\u2019re hidden by CSS.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Helpful block transforms<\/h4>\n<p>I added a couple transforms, to and from headings and paragraphs, and a raw shortcut when you type <code>%%<\/code> and hit the [space] key. This lets me quickly add comments, and even convert whole paragraphs or headings to a comment.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Easily resolve comments<\/h4>\n<p>To support that path towards simplicity, I wanted a method to quickly resolve \u2014 i.e. banish \u2014 a comment entirely. So, I added a toolbar control to quickly resolve the comment, removing the block entirely.<\/p>\n<h4>4. No rich text support<\/h4>\n<p>Comments need to have minimal impact on editing, and feel as natural as possible. That\u2019s why there are no typical RichText controls (although you can still bold, italicize and add hyperlinks). And while you <em>can<\/em> change the color of the comment \u2014 there are no other typographic controls.<\/p>\n<h4>5. Entirely CSS Variable ready<\/h4>\n<p>Global styles and full site editing are opening the door for themes to be heavily powered by CSS variables. Blocks should be designed with that same mentality, which is exactly what I did here. I added simple CSS variables with fallbacks that are the default values. To further theme the comment, there\u2019s no need to override any styles with classes, just write a few CSS variables.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>markdown-comment-block<\/code> folder to your <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory or alternatively upload the markdown-comment-block.zip file via the plugin page of WordPress by clicking &#8216;Add New&#8217; and selecting the zip from your local computer.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Search for the block within the Gutenberg block editor.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='can%20the%20markdown%20comment%20block%20be%20used%20with%20my%20theme%3F'>\nCan the Markdown Comment block be used with my theme?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! If you&#8217;re using Gutenberg (i.e. the block editor) on your site, you should have no issues with the block.
