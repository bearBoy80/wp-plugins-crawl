For each file, it searches pages or posts that<br \/>\nreference the file.  That is, the plugin searches for the part of each file&#8217;s path that comes after the path<br \/>\nto the uploads folder, such as <code>2010\/01\/my great but forgotten image.jpg<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>The path is searched as-is, as well as URL-encoded with &#8216;%20&#8217; for spaces, and the same with &#8216;+&#8217; for spaces &#8211;<br \/>\n    2010\/01\/my%20great%20but%20forgotten%20image.jpg and <code>2010\/01\/my+great+but+forgotten+image.jpg<\/code>.  HTML entity-encoded<br \/>\nforms of all of these are also searched.<\/p>\n<p>If no matches are found, then the file is considered unused.<\/p>\n<p>Note that this plugin plays it safe, and does not distinguish between older post\/page revisions and the current version<br \/>\nof a post\/page.  If a revision references a file, the file will be considered still in use.<\/p>\n<h3>Restoring<\/h3>\n<p>If something goes wrong, you can always restore.  If you have shell access to your site, this is easy.  Simply log in,<br \/>\nnavigate to your <code>wp-content\/plugins<\/code> directory, and locate the Upload Janitor archive &#8211; it will look like<br \/>\n    upload_janitor_archive_YYYY-mm-dd.tar.gz.  Then, type:<\/p>\n<pre><code>    tar zxf &lt;archive name&gt; .\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This will restore all files within the archive.<\/p>\n<p>If you do not have shell access to your server, you will have to download the archive, extract it, then upload the<br \/>\ncontents back to your server.  The archive will be accessible at http:\/\/your-blog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/upload_janitor_archive_YYYY-mm-dd.tar.gz<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Unzip the package, and upload <code>upload-janitor<\/code> to the <code>wp-content\/plugins<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Visit &#8216;Upload Janitor&#8217; within the &#8216;Tools&#8217; menu in WordPress to use<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tweak for compatibility with some apparently buggy PHP installations<\/li>\n<li>Additional error reporting for &#8216;tar&#8217; archiver<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Not great, lacks features<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"2 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"2\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/amityweb\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/cb653890395f5137195dd6fac3d312c3?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/cb653890395f5137195dd6fac3d312c3?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/amityweb\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">amityweb<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 19, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This is good in concept but not good in pratice because of the lack of the following important features:\n\n1) Cant set it to check only media folders (e.g. 2016, 2017 etc), and it will check the whole Uploads folder. Therefore it reports files as \"not being used\" as actually being used, like we have geo location data, ithemes security logs, backups etc. We are only interested in the media items, so would like to specify media folders\n\n2) Does not show thumbnails, only a list. If you have an image called 3e67dhw39d3.jpg you have no chance knowing what it is whether you want to delete it or not\n\n3) It checks the posts if the images are used or not. This is not actually the best way. What i would expect is to compare the Uploads folder to the Media section in WordPress. I would like to delete files in uploads that are not listed in Media. Instead it is suggesting to delete files that are in Media but just not in any post (does it even check ACF fields?)<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/upload-janitor.0.2.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"clean":"clean","delete":"delete","files":"files","unused":"unused","upload":"upload"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/upload-janitor.0.1.zip","0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/upload-janitor.0.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/upload-janitor.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/atastypixel.com\/blog\/wordpress\/plugins\/upload-janitor","banners":[]}
