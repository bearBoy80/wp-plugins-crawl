If you want to use it in full capacity, consider getting <a href=\"https:\/\/shop.milandinic.com\/downloads\/simple-email-queue-plus\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plus version<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Usage<\/h3>\n<p>First, you need to set what is maximum number of emails that can be sent in a given period. By default, it sends 10 emails in 6 minutes. This means that if you want to send 15 emails in 6 minutes, only 10 emails are sent while rest 5 emails are put in queue and sent in the next period, after 6th minute has passed.<\/p>\n<p>You can change this limits by using filters from you code. Filter <code>simple_email_queue_max<\/code> is used to set maximum number of emails that are sent in period. It expects positive integer to be passed.<\/p>\n<p>To change period length, you can use filter <code>simple_email_queue_interval<\/code>. It also expects positive integer to be passed but please take care that this number is of seconds, not minutes (for example, if your period is 30 minutes, you would pass <code>1800<\/code>).<\/p>\n<p>Different hosts use different limits. Please consult your host&#8217;s documentation or support to find this out.<\/p>\n<p>If you want user interface in your admin area, use <a href=\"https:\/\/shop.milandinic.com\/downloads\/simple-email-queue-plus\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plus version<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To use this limits, you need to use function <code>simple_email_queue_add()<\/code> instead of built-in function <code>wp_mail()<\/code>. Both accept same parameters.<br \/>\nEmails that are sent using <code>wp_mail()<\/code> function are not sent using queue and are not counted for limits. If you want that all emails are sent using queue, even those sent using <code>wp_mail()<\/code> function, use <a href=\"https:\/\/shop.milandinic.com\/downloads\/simple-email-queue-plus\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plus version<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/dimadin\/simple-email-queue\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub<\/a>.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Released on 4th April 2019<\/li>\n<li>Use latest version of both <code>WP_Temporary<\/code> and <code>Backdrop<\/code> packages<\/li>\n<li>Increase required PHP version<\/li>\n<li>Improve README<\/li>\n<li>Minor code changes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Released on 15th December 2015<\/li>\n<li>Sync <code>WP_Temporary<\/code> with WordPress 4.4<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Released on 2nd November 2015<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t use Composer files as of this version<\/li>\n<li>Various README improvements<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Released on 12th October 2015<\/li>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Essential plugin for WordPress and for sending bulk eMails<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/hatthabasel\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d732ac4dcfb82ea7fd86abebee6d3607?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d732ac4dcfb82ea7fd86abebee6d3607?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/hatthabasel\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Atipa Pluemchai <small>(hatthabasel)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 4, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This plugin is an absolute must for all WordPress users who want to send bulk emails to their WordPress users without having to purchase services from bulk email service companies like SendinBue or MailChimp. \n\nThe software consists of two plugins \"Simple Email Queue\" and \"Simple Email Queue Plus\", the last one just costs 10$ and does a great job. In the Settings you can define the interval in seconds of sending eMails and in the second field you can define the max number of eMails to send for the defined interval.\n\nIt works great even with other plugin. If you have question, just ask Milan the developer. Milan is very competent and provides excellent support.\n\nI'm excited!\n\nAtipa Pluemchai\nHattha Thai Spa, Basel, Switzerland<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/simple-email-queue.1.3.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"email":"email","email-queue":"email queue","emails-limits":"emails limits","queue":"queue","sending-limits":"sending limits"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/simple-email-queue.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/simple-email-queue.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/simple-email-queue.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/simple-email-queue.1.3.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/simple-email-queue.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/milandinic.com\/donate\/","banners":[]}
