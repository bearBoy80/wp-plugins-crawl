With that information,<br \/>\nthe plug-in generates a moderately attractive status page that allows you to view at a glance the state of your bucket&#8217;s tests (pass or fail).<\/p>\n<p>This is great for organizations that wish to expose a basic level of information about system status to the public (or private, if you choose to make<br \/>\nthe page in WordPress set that way, or password protected) without having to give people access to your Runscope account.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Enable <strong>Status Page for Runscope<\/strong> within the <strong>Plugins<\/strong> &gt; <strong>Installed Plugins<\/strong> interface.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a new Page by navigating to <strong>Pages<\/strong> &gt; <strong>Add New<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Give the new Page a quick name (eg. &#8220;Status&#8221;). Next, change the page template by selecting <strong>Page Attributes<\/strong> &gt; <strong>Template<\/strong> and selecting the<br \/>\n&#8220;Status Page for Runscope&#8221; template.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In the <strong>Publish<\/strong> metabox, click the <strong>Publish<\/strong> button to save and create the new Page.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>On the edit screen of your new Page, a metabox called <strong>Status Page for Runscope Settings<\/strong> will appear. Following the instructions provided in the<br \/>\nmetabox, enter a <strong>Access Token<\/strong> and <strong>Bucket Key<\/strong>, and save those settings by clicking the <strong>Update<\/strong> button.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>View your Page. If your Runscope settings were entered correctly, the page should pause briefly, and then show the last state of each Test in the<br \/>\nbucket, as well as a summary of the bucket at the top of the page. Done!<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Tips &amp; Tricks<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve got object caching turned on in WordPress, the page will automatically cache the last response it got from Runscope for 60 seconds. It&#8217;ll mean<br \/>\nthe results of your page will be slightly out of date (by up to 60 seconds), but the results will display much quicker.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s totally possible to display multiple status pages for different buckets in Runscope! Just create a new Page per each bucket and make sure to enter the right bucket key into each.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release; tested compatibility with WordPress v4.2.4.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/status-page-for-runscope.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":[],"versions":[],"donate_link":"https:\/\/github.com\/yllus\/api-status-page","banners":[]}
