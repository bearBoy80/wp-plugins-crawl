Now you can.<\/p>\n<p>Install this plugin and activate it on the main site and for each subsite that should use the main site&#8217;s forums, or network-activate to enable on all sub sites.<\/p>\n<p>If you want both main site and sub site forums displayed on the sub site, set a different root slug and topics slug in the forum settings. After that, both slugs will be known on the sub site and display their respective forums.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BUT!<\/strong> There is a reason why you cannot normally do this and that is because the code base is not really supportive of it. I have monkey patched my way to the goal and I&#8217;m doing some evil black magic like hooking &#8216;query&#8217; and running regular expressions on the query. All of this is only ever done to your forum pages, so be cool, give it a try. If it works for you: great. If it doesn&#8217;t: deactivate, relax, look for a different solution (or patch mine).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Profile Note:<\/strong> Profiles are not merged! Favorites, topics started etc show main\/sub site only. If you want your users to see all their subscriptions in one place, you&#8217;ll have to write some custom code and likely patch my code too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BuddyPress Note:<\/strong> It does work with network enabled BuddyPress, but they don&#8217;t play together nicely because of the BuddyPress\/bbPress integration stuff. I have monkey patched this to work. If you do not have BuddyPress installed in \/members\/ you&#8217;ll have to monkey patch my monkey patch, please see the code. And as for the profiles: Same thing as with bbPress profiles.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great Ideas<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/skriaz\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e44bb7cfc376c8521073dcb1f0dd1b60?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e44bb7cfc376c8521073dcb1f0dd1b60?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/skriaz\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">skriaz<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 27, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">It is Great Alternative plugin.
