Compare this with the desktop on your<br \/>\ncomputer: 100 links in plain text or 100 links with app icons, what do you prefer? Exactly!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Note 1: this plugin only supports PHP version 5.3 or later (see FAQ)<\/li>\n<li>Note 2: this plugin is still in BETA until it is at version 1.0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>includes a server component and a client component, so you can have a single icon server on<br \/>\na high power machine and lots of clients just requesting icons, you could even set up a server<br \/>\nfor your friends (or as a business functionality). However ofcourse you can enable both the client<br \/>\nand the server if your run this on just 1 installation,<br \/>\nit also means you can build clients in different languages requesting icons from your server. <\/li>\n<li>add icons in content, widget areas, comment area and comment author link each with its own styling.<br \/>\nIf you understand filters in WordPress you can add them to any piece of content.<\/li>\n<li>add icons from scanning sites directly, their \/favicon.ico, Google and getIcon.org. The more<br \/>\nproviders you add the higher the chance it will get to 100% icons. (however there are some urls<br \/>\nusing conditional javascript redirects to other sites containing the favicons that still slip).<\/li>\n<li>image filtes such as converting all icons to PNG. If you understand WordPress filters you can<br \/>\nadd more icon filters to build a nice physical directory with icons in your desired format<\/li>\n<li>add default icons (if a site has none), several IDENTICONS is included, you can add more<br \/>\ndefault icons if you know WordPress coding a bit.<\/li>\n<li>exclusion of filetypes: do not process pdf, zip etc&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>status icons showing you: good links, redirects and bad links (handy for cleaning). You can<br \/>\nextend this to all HTTP return codes. 418 however is included if you can find a site that<br \/>\nreturns a 418 \ud83d\ude42<\/li>\n<li>lots of developer filters so you can after process image or add your own components in the flow<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Low Fat:<\/p>\n<p>The server will search for an icon only every 30 seconds (default) and in the meanwhile use Google<br \/>\nfor icons so you will SLOWLY build a good icon base. On top of that the client requests are<br \/>\ntransient cached on 1 hour (default) so every unique request only call the server once each<br \/>\nhour (and even then only if a visitor hits that page). On top of that the server has a transient<br \/>\ncache also on 1 hour (default). So &#8230; it will build up very slowly with<br \/>\nperformance and being nice to your database and providers in mind. However notice that if you have<br \/>\na lot of outgoing links the server will grow to a large database (it stores all requests and<br \/>\nicons).<\/p>\n<p>Developers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>can add their own plugins for each of the modules provided:<\/li>\n<li>can add their own plugins to define pieces of content to filter<\/li>\n<li>can add plugins to the cache<\/li>\n<li>can add plugins for other favicon sources or repositories<\/li>\n<li>can add plugins for providing other default icons<\/li>\n<li>can add plugins for handling other filetypes content<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The plugin uses a plugin framework (GPLv2) so you can also copy the framework and make your<br \/>\nown plugin around it. If you have improvements on it please send them to me.<\/p>\n<p>Languages:<\/p>\n<p>The plugin is ready for internationalization but since I still intent to make a lot<br \/>\nof changes full translation will happen in a later release. I also need to write<br \/>\nsome of the inline help.<\/p>\n<h3>Contact Info<\/h3>\n<p>contact info:<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/edward.de.leau.net\/contact<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>download the plugin from https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/wp-favicons\/<\/li>\n<li>copy the complete directory in your plugin dir<\/li>\n<li>activate the CLIENT plugin in WordPress clients <\/li>\n<li>activate the SERVER plugin on the WP install you are going to use as icon server<\/li>\n<li>(or activate them both if you have just 1 installation)<\/li>\n<li>go to setting &gt; icon client \/ icon server to configure the settings<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"<p>Q: Is there an example?<br \/>\nA: See &#8220;http:\/\/populair.eu&#8221; that uses the client to request icons from the server<\/p>\n<p>Q: What is Dummy Mode?<br \/>\nA: If you have not turned on the cache you are in dummy modus: all your icons will be<br \/>\n   retrieved from Google.<\/p>\n<p>Q: Should I turn on all image providers?<br \/>\nA: This will take the longest time during load but it definitely will provide you with<br \/>\n   the most correct list of icons e.g. facebook application need to have a pagescan for the<br \/>\n   favicon<\/p>\n<p>Q: Does it work with all favicons out there?<br \/>\nA: Still enhancing the code to at least grab everything possible<\/p>\n<p>Q: Why dont i see all icons?<br \/>\nA: There are several caches to slowly load the icons from requests. If you want to disable<br \/>\n   caching and BURST a lot of requests to both providers and your own database you can set<br \/>\n   WP_FAVICON_TRANSIENT_TIMEOUT to 1 in the client and WP_FAVICON_REQUEST_TIMEOUT in the<br \/>\n   server files (wp-favicons-client.php and wp-favicons-server.php). Only recommended if you<br \/>\n   have the bandwidth<\/p>\n<p>Q: When should I clean the cache?<br \/>\nA: After you make changes to the settings or if a new version of the plugin arrives that fixes<br \/>\n   more items that concern the cache<\/p>\n<p>Q: Is it final yet?<br \/>\nA: No only if it reaches version 1.0.0 it will be out of beta so if you have suggestions for improvements<br \/>\n   please e-mail me<\/p>\n<p>Q: What are the PHP 5.3 or later requirements?<br \/>\nA: these are my includes: ?with-curl ?with-pdo-mysql=mysqlnd ?with-zlib ?with-mcrypt<br \/>\n   ?enable-mbstring ?enable-mbregex ?with-gd ?with-jpeg-dir ?with-png-dir ?with-xmlrpc<\/p>\n<p>Q: If i build my own client what is the XMLRPC call?<br \/>\nA: default WP XMLRPC: blogid, username, password, followed by &#8216;text&#8217;, you will get the<br \/>\n   text as return value enriched with links to icons<\/p>\n","changelog":"<ul>\n<li>v.0.1 initial version<\/li>\n<li>v.0.2 adds widget support<\/li>\n<li>v.0.3 cache support + file types exclusions + static css<\/li>\n<li>v.0.4.0 I18n, added plugins support, new plugin framework<\/li>\n<li>v.0.4.5 app.facebook.com icons are now supported<\/li>\n<li>v.0.4.7 comment author link added and fixes for icons with different extensions<\/li>\n<li>v.0.4.8 temporary disabled the cache<\/li>\n<li>v.0.4.9 new db hash fix <\/li>\n<li>v.0.5.4 adds status icons<\/li>\n<li>v.0.5.7 quick fix for wp3.3<\/li>\n<li>v.0.6.0 code now split in server and client component<\/li>\n<li>v.0.6.3 added more transient xmlrpc caching + optimzed outgoing requests timeout<\/li>\n<li>v.0.6.6 changed database check to check updates in informationschema<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-favicons\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1566901\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-favicons\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1566901\" alt=\"Example of my sidebar &quot;lifeline&quot;
