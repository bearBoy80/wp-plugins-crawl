Crawling these links normally requires a lot of CPU, memory and bandwidth because they are not cacheable and\/or create crawling loops (while they are useless). Optimizing your robots.txt when running a WooCommerce online store allocates more processing power for pages that really matter.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin also blocks the search pages from WordPress from getting indexed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Please only activate this plugin if you know what you&#8217;re doing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h4>What can I do with this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>This plugin adds the necessary lines to the virtual robots.txt file that WordPress creates automagically to block to block WooCommerce assets that should not be indexed and the Search pages.<\/p>\n<h4>What ideas is this plugin based on?<\/h4>\n<p>None. We needed a fast solution to add these lines to the robots.txt file and this was the solution we coded.<\/p>\n<h4>What is the robots.txt file?<\/h4>\n<p>The robots.txt file is a plain text file located at the root folder of a domain (or subdomain) which tells web crawlers (like Googlebot) what parts of the website they should access and index.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing a search engine crawler looks at when it is visiting a page is the robots.txt file and it controls how search engine spiders see and interact with the web pages.<\/p>\n<h4>System requirements<\/h4>\n<p>PHP version 7.1 or greater.<br \/>\nWe require 7.1 or higher because we believe that everybody should be running a modern PHP version.
