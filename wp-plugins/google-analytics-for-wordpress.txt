Most of them do not provide accurate WordPress analytics either.<\/p>\n<p>Some WordPress stats plugins use third-party servers to mitigate this issue, but they all lack powerful features that Google Analytics can offer.<\/p>\n<p>Google Analytics is the #1 analytics solution in the world. It comes with all the powerful features that you can ever ask for. MonsterInsights makes it easy for you to use all advanced Google Analytics features in WordPress.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20choose%20google%20analytics%20by%20monsterinsights%20vs%20google%20site%20kit%3F'>\nWhy choose Google Analytics by MonsterInsights vs Google Site Kit?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The MonsterInsights Google Analytics plugin is built for all types of websites, large or small, to get up and running quickly with Google Analytics and Google Analytics 4.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond simply providing a Google Analytics dashboard, our plugin makes configuring advanced features as easy as point-and-click that would otherwise still require a developer to implement.<\/p>\n<p>Our Google Analytics plugin also includes many features such as Google Ads tracking, Google Optimize support, form conversion reporting, goal tracking, Search Console integration, Pagespeed insights, advanced eCommerce tracking, and more.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a reason over 3 million users have trusted MonsterInsights to provide Google Analytics data to their website.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20monsterinsights%20together%20with%20another%20google%20analytics%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I use MonsterInsights together with another Google Analytics plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You should only use one Google Analytics plugin on your WordPress site.
