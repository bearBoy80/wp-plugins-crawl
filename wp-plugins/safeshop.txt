Totaling 25KB in 9.6s\n\nI would like the ability to chose where to position the trust mark on the website. A floating bar is an antiquated way of adding these things. \n<ul>\nIn the footer\nDuring checkout.\nWidget\n<\/ul>\n\nIf the app\/service is going to request reviews... does it integrate with the woocommerce email templates (eg: Completed order)?\n\nCan the merchant use the reviews for testimonials on the website by way of a widget \/ shortcode?\n\nFrom a merchant point of view, Trust Seals are good to display as it can increase conversions. It appears only to service Safeshop by creating customer-generated content for their ecosystem. \n\n2 stars because it works, but at this point adds little value at this time. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/safeshop.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"consumer-trust":"consumer trust","reduce-costs":"reduce costs","safe-shop":"safe.shop","trust-seal":"trust seal","trustmark":"trustmark"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
