Version 1.0.1 should work much better.<\/p>\n<p>If you want a different CSS file (also known as a skin) for the different sites you are working on in WordPress Multi-Site you have to make a child theme (best practice) or copy a theme and change its name, css, and whatever else you may desire to change (less than optimal solution).<\/p>\n<p>But wait! There is a better solution!<\/p>\n<p>You can add site specific CSS to each blog individually, instead of changing your theme or using a million child themes.<\/p>\n<p>This let\u2019s you keep all the functionality built into your favorite theme and just change the look a bit. It is a much lighter solution than creating yet another child theme? which gets tedious on multi sites.<\/p>\n<p>We originally developed this because we created a child theme based on twenty-ten and then wanted to create several variations? but wordpress doesn\u2019t let you make a child theme of a child theme. Now, we do not need to. And for just thirty nine ninty&#8230; wait&#8230; It is free? What is wrong with us?<\/p>\n<p>Got comments? Wanna share this with all your multi-site friends? Cool! We do too!<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Here are three different ways you can install this plug-in:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use the handy install option built into wordpress.<\/li>\n<li>or&#8230; Download the zip file, un-zip, and upload to the plug-ins directory.<\/li>\n<li>or&#8230; Copy the contents of site-specific-css.php to the functions.php of your favorite child theme.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Then if you installed as a plug-in (options 1 or 2 above), activate the plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Next make sure you can upload a css file.<br \/>\n1. Goto the Super Admin menu<br \/>\n1. Select options, and near the bottom find a list of all acceptable file extensions.<br \/>\n1. Make sure css is on the list.<\/p>\n<p>Now to use it.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the css file you\u2019d like to apply to your site using the media upload (recommended) or ftp.<\/li>\n<li>After you upload, copy the location of the file.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure you have the correct site and child theme active, then look under appearance. There will be a new menu item for Site Specific CSS.<\/li>\n<li>Paste the URL of the CSS file into the only (for now) option box, then save changes.<\/li>\n<li>Enjoy your new look.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>What is next for this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Here are some features we want to add: (feel free to vote on features and\/or contribute code)<br \/>\n* Link to multiple custom CSS files.<br \/>\n* Include a small amount of CSS directly in the header via an input box.<br \/>\n* Upload to the media library directly from the options page.<br \/>\n* Allow linking to files in the media library via point and click.<br \/>\n* Check that CSS is a valid upload type and add if not.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What other questions do you have?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is the first release so we are gathering questions right now.
