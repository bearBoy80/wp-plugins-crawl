Select which posts are included in your indexes using<br \/>\na combination of categories and tags, display them in up to four columns on a single page or over multiple pages.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the AZIndex plugin can be used to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create an alphabetical index of all your blog posts, based on their titles, using extracts as short descriptions.<\/li>\n<li>Create a music review index, sorted by the name of the artist and the name of their albums.<\/li>\n<li>On blogs with multiple authors, create an index of posts by each author&#8217;s name.<\/li>\n<li>Create a full alphabetical index of all your blog&#8217;s published pages in seconds with no PHP, HTML, or CSS required.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Full list of features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Index blog posts by title, extract, author, or any custom field.<\/li>\n<li>Create indexes for your blog pages.

This is the text like &#8220;(more)&#8221; and &#8220;(continued)&#8221; that appear on the index page.  I will do the admin pages too once the plugin gets closer to being finished.  I will, of course, make the POT file available for people to translate into their languages.

Just check the appropriate option in the settings for your index.  If you only want to index pages,<br \/>\nremember to check the option to exclude posts from the index.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>But I only want to add some of my pages to the index.  How do I do that?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>With posts it&#8217;s easy, you can tag or categorize the ones you want to put in an index and you&#8217;re done.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no easy way to categorize or tag pages, but don&#8217;t worry, there is a nice little plugin<br \/>\ncalled <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/tags4page\/\" rel=\"ugc\">tags4page<\/a> which allows you to tag pages when you edit<br \/>\nthem. Once you have tagged the pages you want in the index simply specify that tag in the index settings.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What if I want an index that includes all my posts except a few that I don&#8217;t want in there?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can tag posts you don&#8217;t want in your index or put them into a category, and then exclude that category or tag<br \/>\nfrom the index by adding its name to the &#8220;Include\/exclude category (or tag)&#8221; fields with a &#8216;~&#8217; character in front of it.<br \/>\nFor example, if you want to exclude all your announcements from your index, tag all those posts with an &#8216;announcements&#8217;<br \/>\ntag and then add &#8220;~announcements&#8221; to the &#8220;Include\/exclude tags&#8221; field in the index settings.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>When I have more than one column on a page, why are the columns sometimes different lengths?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>That is because the index items are split evenly between the columns, but some items can take up more column space<br \/>\nthan others.  If there are several large items in one of the columns, it may end up being much longer than the others.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Help! The headings in my index have no links.  What gives?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You probably have the &#8216;Group items&#8230;&#8221; option selected for your index.  If you don&#8217;t have any subheadings,<br \/>\nthen make sure you deselect this option.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why does the layout of my index look strange with some WordPress themes?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well, just like anything else appearing in a page or post on your blog, your blog&#8217;s current theme will affect<br \/>\nthe appearance of the index.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the time that&#8217;s a good thing, because you don&#8217;t want your indexes to look out of place in your blog.<br \/>\nBut occasionally a WordPress theme&#8217;s stylesheet just may not work well with your index.<\/p>\n<p>If that happens there are two ways to resolve the problem:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Modify the theme&#8217;s stylesheet so that it doesn&#8217;t interfere with the appearance of the index.<\/li>\n<li>Turn on the &#8220;Use customized stylesheets&#8221; option for your index then modify the index&#8217;s stylesheet to fix any unsightly styling.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Note: One common problem with some themes is that you&#8217;ll see bullets appearing next to items in the index.<br \/>\nThis happens when there is a CSS style in the theme&#8217;s stylesheet that defines the style tag &#8216;list-style-type&#8217;<br \/>\nor &#8216;list-style&#8217;.  The easiest way to fix this is to comment out or delete this line from your theme&#8217;s stylesheet,<br \/>\nbut you should check to see if this causes other formatting issues in your blog.  If you feel you can&#8217;t<br \/>\nremove that line, the next easiest way to solve the problem is to make a copy of that style (it will begin<br \/>\nsomething like &#8220;#content .page ul ol {&#8220;), turn on custom CSS styling for the index and paste the style<br \/>\ninto the stylesheet for the index.  Then all you have to do is modify the &#8220;list-style&#8221; (or &#8220;list-style-type&#8221;)<br \/>\nelement and replace &#8220;disc&#8221; (or whatever the type is) with &#8220;none&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Another problem I have seen can happen with multi-column indexes where the right-hand column<\/p>\n<p>Once I have some time, I will write a longer article about modifying stylesheets since this is an important<br \/>\ntopic in getting your index to look just the way you want it.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I get AZIndex to work with the WP Super Cache plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Easy.  Just follow the instructions provided with WP Super Cache to install and configure that plugin.  Once<br \/>\nyou see that blog pages are being cached (check the &#8220;cached pages&#8221; counters on the WP Super Cache settings page<br \/>\nif you&#8217;re not sure if they are) then you should see you index pages being cached too.  If you make a change to<br \/>\nyour blog that affects the contents of your index, AZIndex will tell WP Super Cache to flush the cache so that<br \/>\na new index page can be generated.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Help!  I am having problems getting WP Super Cache to work.<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;m afraid I cannot offer any assistance unless the problem is directly related to AZIndex.  WP Super Cache is a very popular<br \/>\nplugin and there is plenty of advice and help available on the web both at the<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/wp-super-cache\/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress site<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/ocaoimh.ie\/wp-super-cache\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin owner&#8217;s<br \/>\nhome page<\/a>.  If you are having trouble with index pages being updated because of WP Super Cache, you can add<br \/>\nthe index page URL(s) to the list of &#8220;Rejected URIs&#8221; in the WP Super Cache settings page.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I get non-English characters in my index links and headings to display correctly?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Select the <em>&#8220;Turn on additional support for national languages&#8221;<\/em> option in the index settings.  Note, in the<br \/>\nvast majority of cases, you should not have to use the other NLS options (locale or collation table).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I have turned on the national language support, but the items in the index are not being sorted in the correct order for my language.<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is possible that you are running on a server that is not using the correct locale for your language.  You can<br \/>\nset a different locale by selecting the <em>&#8220;Set locale to be used while sorting index&#8221;<\/em> option, but you can only<br \/>\nuse locale names that are supported by the server.  Please ask your system administrator for that information.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>My index is being sorted in the correct order, but items are grouped wrongly and the alphabetical links are incorrect.<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some languages, like Swedish, have different rules for collating (sorting) accented characters from other languages.  When<br \/>\nyou turn on the alphabetical headings and links, AZIndex uses a default collation table to determine how those accented<br \/>\ncharacters should be grouped, but this table does not work for all languages.  For those languages where the collation rules<br \/>\nare different, you can select the <em>&#8220;Set locale to be used while sorting index&#8221;<\/em> option and chose another table from the<br \/>\nsupplied list.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>You say that this is a BETA release, what exact does that mean?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It means that this is an early release of the plugin.  While I have tested many of the features as thoroughly as<br \/>\npossible, I am not able to test all the features of the plugin with all the browsers on all versions of WordPress,<br \/>\nPHP and MySQL.  So it is possible you will come across a combination where there is still a one or two bugs.<\/p>\n<p>It also means that there are one or two features left to be finished, like internationalization.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you may have to delete and recreate your indexes when you decide to move up to a new version.  Please read<br \/>\nthe release notes before upgrading.<\/p>\n<p>However, the vast majority of users should be able to use this version of the plugin without any trouble.<br \/>\nJust make sure to test it out before you publish your index page.<\/p>\n<p>Any feedback you can provide me is most welcome.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I still have more questions\/problems\/requests, where do I go for answers?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simple, either leave a comment at the <a href=\"http:\/\/azindex.englishmike.net\/feedback\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AZIndex Plugin Home Page<\/a>,<br \/>\nor email me at
