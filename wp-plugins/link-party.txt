Display the images in a structured way.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>\/illi3<\/code> directory to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Visit the Link Party! Settings menu to create and view Link Parties.<\/li>\n<li>Use shortcode to view a party on a page.  [linkparty id=&#8221;#&#8221;] where # is the number of the Link Party<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>How do i submit a link<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Links are submitted in posts and pages by using the shortcode.  At the bottom of a gallery is the submit button, as long as the submission end date has not been reached.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I delete something?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can delete a Link Party from the settings page, but we recommend not doing that because it will break that shortcode if you have previously used it.  As for individual images, when you are logged into wordpress and viewing your site, a red X will appear next to the link.  Clicking that red X will delete that link.  Only people logged in with editing privileges will be able to see the X.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Where are the images stored<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>All images are stored on your website in the content directory.  This plugin does not rely on third party software or hosting, which increases speed for the gallery.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What if I don&#8217;t want my Link Party to start until a certain date.<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently their is functionality to have submissions end by a certain period, but we did not want the plugin confusing by having starting and ending times.  If you do not want your party to go live until a certain time, we recommend you use the built-in WordPress publish time functionality.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Will this be the last version of Link Party!?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We hope not.  There are features we would love to add and if the plugin is used we plan on adding new features.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I have multiple Parties on a single page?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. And No.  You can display as many galleries as you like on a single page, but currently you can only add a link to the top most party.  Even if the 2nd party is open for submissions, new submissions will be added to the top-most Party.  However if you want to do a round up of Parties where submissions have ended, you can have as many links as possible.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/link-party.1.0.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"gallery":"gallery","illi-style":"illi style","image-submission":"image submission","link-party":"link party","linkparty":"linkparty"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/link-party.1.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/link-party.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.illistyle.com\/linkparty\/","banners":[]}
