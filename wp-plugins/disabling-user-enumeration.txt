User enumeration is often a web application vulnerability, though it can also be found in any system that requires user authentication.<\/p>\n<p>An enumeration attack allows a hacker to check whether a name exists in the database. For example, to set up a brute-force attack, rather than searching through login and password pairs, all they need is a matching password for a verified user name, saving time and effort.<\/p>\n<p>The phrase \u201cusername harvesting\u201d refers to a vulnerability that when exploited allows people or programs interacting with an application to determine what a valid username is vs an invalid username.<\/p>\n<p>**You can check your site have user enumeration by simply type https:\/\/selectedfirms.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users that&#8217;s it. **<\/p>\n<p>Features:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>We only disable for non logged in users.<\/li>\n<li>You can deactivate with single click.
