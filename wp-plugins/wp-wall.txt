In short, folks just don't want to register, because they honestly don't know what will happen to their personal data after they provide it. Will it be sold? Will they suddenly begin receiving piles of email spam? Or worse?<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, this can have a negative influence on the number of actual registered members that you have on your WP blog.<\/p>\n<p>But wouldn't it be nice if your WP blog visitors could at least let you know through a comment that they stopped by, without having to go through the hassle of actually registering on your blog?<\/p>\n<p>Enter the WP Wall plug-in.<\/p>\n<p>While you can force them to leave an email address if you want to, you can let them post on your WP Wall without becoming a registered member of your blog, without submitting themselves to a CAPTCHA, and without leaving an email address. According to the author of this plug-in -- Vladimir -- you will still have protection from anti-spam plug-ins, such as Akismet, being as WP Wall comments are stored in the regular comments section on your blog.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, also, unlike some of Vladimir's more expensive commercial plug-ins, this plug-in is free. So that is a plus.<\/p>\n<p>The only reason why I gave this plug-in four stars instead of five, is because I discovered a few small bugs in the CSS interface.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-wall\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1567131","caption":"WP Wall in Action"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-wall\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1567131","caption":"WP Wall Admin Panel"}},"tags":{"ajax":"ajax","comments":"comments","jquery":"jquery","post":"post","posts":"posts"},"versions":{"0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.0.2.zip","0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.0.3.zip","0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.0.4.zip","0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.0.5.zip","0.51":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.0.51.zip","0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.0.6.zip","0.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.0.7.zip","0.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.0.8.zip","0.8,1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.0.8,1.zip","0.8.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.0.8.2.zip","0.8.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.0.8.3.zip","1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.0.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.2.zip","1.2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.2.1.zip","1.2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.2.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.3.zip","1.3.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.3.1.zip","1.3.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.3.2.zip","1.3.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.3.4.zip","1.3.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.3.5.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.4.zip","1.4.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.4.1.zip","1.4.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.4.2.zip","1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.5.zip","1.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.6.zip","1.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.7.zip","1.7.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.7.2.zip","1.7.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-wall.1.7.3.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.networkforgood.org\/donation\/MakeDonation.aspx?ORGID2=510144434","banners":[]}
