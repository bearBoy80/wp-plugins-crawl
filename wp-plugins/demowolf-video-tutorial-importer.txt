DemoWolf is a producer of video support tutorials that focus on the web hosting industry, and includes hundreds of how-to videos on such topics as cPanel, Plesk, WordPress, WHMCS, Email programs, Facebook, Twitter&#8230; and many other subjects that web hosting end users often need help with. Members get access to these videos and can embed them on their websites, typically in their support pages or a knowledgebase.<\/p>\n<p>Once you download the videos.xml file from your demowolf.com Members Area, you&#8217;ll use the DemoWolf Video Tutorial Import Plugin to import that file to your WordPress website. You&#8217;ll have the following 3 options before you import them:<\/p>\n<p>Option 1 &#8211; Import videos as blog posts<br \/>\nThis option creates a new blog post for every video being imported, and creates a new blog post category for each &#8220;video series&#8221;. The videos will be categorized by the series their associated with, with new categories for the series being created as well.<\/p>\n<p>Option 2 &#8211; Import videos as pages ? one page per video series<br \/>\nThis option creates one new page for every &#8220;video series&#8221; being imported, and all videos in that series will be embedded on that page, along with their titles. A video series can have anywhere from 10 to 30 videos in it.<\/p>\n<p>Option 3 &#8211; Import videos as pages ? one page per video<br \/>\nThis option creates one new page for every video being imported. The page title will correspond to the video title, and the video will be embedded on its new page.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Step 1: Login to your DemoWolf.com Member Area, choose the video series you want, then click to export the video embed codes (downloads the videos.xml file)<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: Login to your WordPress website as admin<\/p>\n<p>Step 3: Navigate to Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload Plugin<\/p>\n<p>Step 4: Click &#8216;Choose File&#8217;, locate the DemoWolf Video Tutorial Import Plugin (import_videos.zip), then click &#8216;Install Now&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>Step 5: Click &#8216;Activate Plugin&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Step 6: In the WordPress main menu under &#8216;Tools&#8217;, locate and click the new &#8216;Import Videos&#8217; link.<\/p>\n<p>Step 7: By &#8216;Upload Video XML&#8217;, click &#8216;Choose File&#8217; and select the videos.xml file you downloaded in step 1.<\/p>\n<p>Step 8: Choose which of the 3 import options you want (read the descriptions above)<\/p>\n<p>Step 9: Click &#8216;Import Videos&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it! The plugin automatically imports all videos and sets up new pages (or blog posts and categories) according to the option you chose. You can now further modify your new pages or posts however you want.<\/p>\n<p>For those DemoWolf members who want their videos embedded in their WordPress website, this plugin will definitely help.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Do I have to be a DemoWolf member to use this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Technically no. However, you have to at least have been a DemoWolf member at some point to be able to download the videos.xml file that this plugin is designed to import into your website.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I am not a DemoWolf member, but I do have a copy of the videos.xml file. Will this plugin work for me?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes the plugin will work. It will successfully import all the DemoWolf video embed codes into your website. However, if you are not an active DemoWolf member, then your domain will not be white-listed by DemoWolf, and therefore the videos will not work on your website. Instead of see the videos, you&#8217;ll see an error message.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve already used this plugin to import my DemoWolf videos, but now there are newer DemoWolf videos available that I want to add. Can I use this plugin again?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, absolutely. You can use the plugin as many times as you want. It will create new blog posts or pages each time it&#8217;s used, depending on the options you choose.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/demowolf-video-tutorial-importer\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1559362\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/demowolf-video-tutorial-importer\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1559362\" alt=\"&lt;p&gt;Once the plugin is installed, navigate to &quot;Tools&quot; then &quot;Import Videos&quot; and you&#039;ll arrive at this screen.
