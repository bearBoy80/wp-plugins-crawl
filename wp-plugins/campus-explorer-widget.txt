Find the Campus Explorer widget and drag it to a Widget Area. Update settings (or leave blank for default values) and hit save.<\/p>\n<p>Or you can create a shortcode at Settings &gt; Campus Explorer &gt; Shortcode Builder. The shortcode without any custom settings is, you guessed it, [campusexplorer]. Enter custom texts and area of study and concentration if you need a more customized experience.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Wait, I don&#8217;t have a source code.
