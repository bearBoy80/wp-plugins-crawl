See settings page of SFDL in your WordPress.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20define%20horizontal%2Fvertical%20style%20within%20shortcode%3F'>\nCan I define horizontal\/vertical style within shortcode?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, together with path defined in shortcode you can also define its style. For more information see settings page of SFDL in your WordPress.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20define%20my%20own%20icons%20%2F%20overwrite%20default%20icons%20%2F%20add%20missing%20icons%20for%20file%20extensions%3F'>\nCan I define my own icons \/ overwrite default icons \/ add missing icons for file extensions?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, icons are now loaded as background in css, therefore its easy to overwrite them in your theme style file.<br \/>\nAlso every file div wrapper has a class named as extension of the file. You can then target this class to change\/add icons for the extension (example: .download-icon.pfd).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20disable%2Fenable%20loading%20animation%3F'>\nCan disable\/enable loading animation?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can disable\/enable the animation in settings of the plugin. You can also disable it individually within shortcode by using loading_animation=&#8221;disable&#8221; or loading_animation=&#8221;enable&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20set%20different%20text%20for%20empty%20folders%20based%20on%20page%20language%3F'>\nCan set different text for empty folders based on page language?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can define the text in CSS. You have to get the language from the page somewhere. For example if your theme writes language class to body tag the css will be: body.en_GB .sdfl-no-files-available-wrapper::after {content: &#8220;No files available at the moment.&#8221;;}<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20completely%20change%20the%20styles%20your%20plugin%20is%20using%3F'>\nCan I completely change the styles your plugin is using?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. To use your styles you need to create a folder called simple-ftp-directory-lister within your theme directory with a subfolder called css. From now on all the styles of the plugin will be loaded from this folder. Be aware that you should be using child theme in order to keep any theme changes after you update the theme. There are 5 different css files that controls styles. You need to copy these files from the plugin folder to the css folder you just created. Now change anything you want in these files, the plugin will be loading these and ignore its own css files. Example where you need to create the folder: \/wp-content\/themes\/themeyouareusing\/simple-ftp-directory-lister\/css\/&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.4.6, 1.4.7<\/h4>\n<p>Minor improvements<\/p>\n<h4>1.4.5<\/h4>\n<p>Added possibility to hide file extensions.<\/p>\n<h4>1.4.4<\/h4>\n<p>Added possibility to overtake styles.<\/p>\n<h4>1.4.3<\/h4>\n<p>Updated example of upload directory.<\/p>\n<h4>1.4.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added icon and text if main folder is empty.

I had to present results not as previous by the plugin and it was not very difficult. As I had problem with pagination because the website is only one page to present directory on the homepage, I used posts, one for 20 directories. With the WP pagination and a little adding of PHP. And the results is absolutly as expected.
