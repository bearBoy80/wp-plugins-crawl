Simple to use and provided all the design aspects of a site theme that I needed. I would give it a 4+ STARS with the one exception. The free version has a required credit in the footer which I did not want. In order not to show that there is a modest fee, and rightly so. I had NO problem with the modest fee and gladly paid. Over the course of the next three weeks and MANY emails, I waited for the code, and specific instructions on how to apply. The help desk either did not understand what I was asking or...? \"Please send the code I paid for and specific written instructions on installation and use.\" To which they seemed to answer every question I did not ask and never the one I asked. Never did receive the code, nor instructions. Yes, it was a verified sale - thank you from the ColorLib and tracking\/conformation through PayPal. It was a perfect theme for small to medium sites, clean, well documented. Between myself, friends and family we have purchased at least 8 licenses of ColorLib competition --- of lesser quality, (and more costly) but have learned how to work around the bugs.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Useless<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/suyashekhande\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b9c7bd8e5044dd049445243e054d5f5c?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b9c7bd8e5044dd049445243e054d5f5c?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/suyashekhande\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">suyashekhande<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 13, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Very BAd plugin.
