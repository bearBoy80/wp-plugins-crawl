That was a while ago.  Since then I started to use WordPress (well, this weekend actually), installed Bad Behaviour, and thought &#8220;I really need to be able to see these logs without using phpmyadmin&#8221;.  I then decided to write a plugin that would do that, but did a bit of hunting around first and these guys&#8217; plugins were what I found, so I expanded on them, and this is the result.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>bblr.php<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Optionally set a &#8220;number of log entries per page&#8221; value in the Options -&gt; BBLR Options menu.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Can also (optionally) be installed through the WordPress plugin installer.<\/p>\n","faq":"<p>What version of Bad Behaviour does this work with?<\/p>\n<p>I have tested it with version 2.0.10 + 2.0.16, 2.0.23, 2.0.25 &#8211; It would work with any other version of Bad Behaviour that uses<br \/>\nthe same database table structure.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s the point?<\/p>\n<p>It lets you view the logs that Bad Behaviour keeps for you without you having to leave WordPress<br \/>\nand examine your mysql database.  Handy if you don&#8217;t know SQL or don&#8217;t want to leave the WordPress area.<\/p>\n<p>What you choose to do with that information, is, of course, pretty much up to you.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve noticed in the current (2.0.23) version of Bad Behavior that there is a log reader included, so I probably will<br \/>\nbe developing this only for my own amusement, but there you go.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<p>V1.0    Initial Release<br \/>\nv1.1    Moved main plugin page under Plugins in menu structure<br \/>\n        Added link from activity box.<br \/>\nv1.3    Included checkbox for filtering out warnings<br \/>\n        Localisation of time values.<br \/>\nv1.4    Only shows dashboard entry for authorised users.<br \/>\n    Couple of bits of cleanup.<br \/>\nv1.5    Fix to location of plugin with auto-install.<br \/>\n    Brought key info up to date.<br \/>\nv1.6    Various fixes, code cleanup, ready for WP 2.7<br \/>\nv1.7    Fix up activation\/deactivation<\/p>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bad-behavior-log-reader.1.7.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"antispam":"antispam","bad-behaviour":"Bad Behaviour","logs":"logs","reader":"reader"},"versions":{"1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bad-behavior-log-reader.1.4.zip","1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bad-behavior-log-reader.1.5.zip","1.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bad-behavior-log-reader.1.6.zip","1.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bad-behavior-log-reader.1.7.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/bad-behavior-log-reader.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
