Customers can start a conversation with us and they can go about their day and we can continue the conversation with them on their phone's SMS app. \n\nThe different departments in our company each have the TextSanity account open on a computer and can see and respond immediately when a customer starts a conversation.We also have some sales guys in the field and they just have teh TextSanity mobile app on their phones so when someone starts a conversation that they need to jump in on, they can easily do it from their mobile devices.\n\nNo complaints here. It's just good technology.\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/textsanity.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"sms":"sms","text":"text"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/textsanity.1.0.0.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/textsanity\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2473323","high":false}}
