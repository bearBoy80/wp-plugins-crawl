This plugin lets you manage page comment \/ discussion checkboxes with ease!<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Unzip <code>page_comments_off_please.zip<\/code> inside the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory (or install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer)<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; admin menu in WordPress and the checkboxes will be off next time you go to create a page.<\/li>\n<li>Use the settings page in ( Settings -&gt; Page Comments )  in order to change the default behavior to to disable all page comments.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Installation Instructions<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unzip <code>page_comments_off_please.zip<\/code> inside the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory (or install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer)<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; admin menu in WordPress and the checkboxes will be off next time you go to create a page.<\/li>\n<li>Use the settings page in ( Settings -&gt; Page Comments )  in order to change the default behavior to to disable all page comments.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What is the main function of the plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is designed so that when you create a new page, you don&#8217;t have to uncheck the discussion checkboxes for allow-comments and pingbacks-trackbacks.  This has a button to disable comments on old pages, but that is mainly for people who just forgot to install this to begin with.  It&#8217;s best to use this from the start and include it in your new-site setup routine.  This is targeted toward CMS users and Web Designers.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is this different from the old plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Only a Little.  If you just install it and leave the settings alone, it will continue to work the way you are familiar.  You may be interested in the mass-disable function on the settings page for when you already have comments on your pages.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I set the preference to turn the default comment status for pages off or on?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is located under Settings-&gt;Page Comments.  Enjoy!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What is &#8216;Legacy Mode&#8217; for?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is provided as a backup method for some themes or wordpress customizations prohibit the normal method of operation.
