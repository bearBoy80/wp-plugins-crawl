Search bots won\u2019t run the JavaScript to<br \/>\nto activate the gateway, and so it will not appear for them at all. The script is executed after the page is loaded, and<br \/>\nthe content is rendered.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What source is used for legal drinking ages?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Legal drinking ages by country are referenced from <a href=\"http:\/\/drinkingage.procon.org\/view.resource.php?resourceID=004294\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ProCon.org<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why the hastle, can&#8217;t I just input a specific age?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugins exist that allow you to set a specific age requirement for visitors. This is for worldwide alcohol brands. All countries don\u2019t have the same drinking age.<br \/>\nSo solutions where the gateway is based on a static entry age aren\u2019t viable. An age, and location must be gathered by the gateway to determine if a user is credible<br \/>\nto enter the site. Tequila consumption in Mexico is legal 3 years earlier than it is for residents of California.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.1.0<\/h4>\n<p>As this is the first version, there is not much to say.<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-drinking-age\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1546072\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-drinking-age\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1546072\" alt=\"The admin page showing the options for this plugin.\"><\/a><p>The admin page showing the options for this plugin.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-drinking-age\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1546072\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-drinking-age\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1546072\" alt=\"An example of WP Age Gateway in action with default settings.\"><\/a><p>An example of WP Age Gateway in action with default settings.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-drinking-age.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-drinking-age\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1546072","caption":"The admin page showing the options for this plugin."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-drinking-age\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1546072","caption":"An example of WP Age Gateway in action with default settings."}},"tags":{"age-gateway":"age gateway","age-restriction":"age restriction","drinking-age":"drinking age","drinking-age-gateway":"drinking age gateway","gateway":"gateway"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
