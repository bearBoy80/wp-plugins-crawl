This experimental plugin brings the ability to activate and deactivate plugins from within the customizer. Plugin installation and updates could be a potential future phase depending on the success of this experiment.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the customizer preview cannot currently reflect changes to the active plugins list. Additionally, plugins are not sandboxed &#8211; broken plugins activated from here could break your site. Use this plugin with caution. However, changes are not published to your live site until you &#8220;Save and Publish,&#8221; and the plugin manager does functionally activate and deactivate plugins. Preview functionality requires hooking into WordPress before plugins are loaded (for obvious reasons), which isn&#8217;t possible to do within a plugin.<\/p>\n<p>See https:\/\/core.trac.wordpress.org\/ticket\/40451 for additional discussion.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<p>See full details here: https:\/\/plugins.trac.wordpress.org\/log\/customize-plugin-manager.<\/p>\n<h4>0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix display of active versus network-active plugins on multisite.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/customize-plugin-manager\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1692754\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/customize-plugin-manager\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1692754\" alt=\"Plugins section in the customizer.\"><\/a><p>Plugins section in the customizer.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/customize-plugin-manager.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/customize-plugin-manager\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1692754","caption":"Plugins section in the customizer."}},"tags":{"customize":"customize","plugins":"plugins"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
