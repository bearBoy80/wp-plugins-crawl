So no conflict of interest that I can think of! :)<\/p>\n<p>Seriously though, of course I was a little nervous installing a plugin that hadn't been updated in 4 years, but even though the repository has 851 Google Maps plugins, I only see ONE stopwatch plugin! Granted it may not be the most wanted feature, but for me it's just perfect to add a stopwatch to the class website I'll be using starting next week. When we have timed activities, I can use the timer right from the web page I'm on without having to go anywhere else. Very handy!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks Luis!\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/stopwatch.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/stopwatch\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=657192","caption":"<strong>Paused<\/strong> - Keeps running even after the user leaves.
