In a case, thousands of users are entered by tempring with the basic wp_user table structure.. where ID was converted to just int field with no PRIMARY KEY or INDEX associated, date field (user_registered) was converted to decimal and user_email field was changed to accept only 20 characters (varchar 20) .. etc.. and thus thousands of records were entered through a script with duplicate email addresses, user_logins and even with duplicate IDs!<\/p>\n<p>Note: At the moment, this script takes care of ID, user_login and user_email fields only. One can easily extend it to check other fields as well.<\/p>\n<p>I will try to make those fields entered through a configuration script in near future.<\/p>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/duplicate-user.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":[],"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
