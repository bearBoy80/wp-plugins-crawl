Either the template does not include <code>get_header()<\/code> in its templates pages or the author of the template forgot to include <code>wp_header()<\/code> in the header.php file and\/or <code>wp_footer<\/code> in the footer.php of the WordPress theme. Be sure to look at the default theme, or other quality themes (eg: standards-compliant XHTML and CSS) to see how they work<\/p>\n<p>Q: I&#8217;m using the advanced method but it it does not work for me ?<\/p>\n<p>A: To use the advanced method you must have <strong>a well understanding of html and of the WordPress Loop<\/strong> to determine the html <code>class<\/code> and <code>id<\/code> attributes to make the plugin works. If you don&#8217;t know them because you&#8217;re not familiar with coding and\/or debugging html I shall advise you to use the PHP method.<\/p>\n<p>Q: Can I change the generated list <code>class<\/code> attributes or the generated list appearance ?<\/p>\n<p>A: Of course, in order to do so, you must edit the CSS files you&#8217;ll find in the css subdirectory in the plugin directory<\/p>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/refgenerator.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"links":"links","posts":"posts"},"versions":{"2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/refgenerator.2.2.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=ishop%40isaro%2erw&item_name=RefGenerator&item_number=Support%20Open%20Source&no_shipTags","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/refgenerator\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=530678","high":false}}
