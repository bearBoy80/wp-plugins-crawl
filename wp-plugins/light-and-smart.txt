It works as said on the description.\n\nThis plugin is for the tiny bits of kilobytes that was left unoptimized, cleaning the WP emojis (who use them these days?) and removed the generator meta tag. This is enough to like the plugin already.\n\nSecondly - for those who're installing heavy plugins just to include GA\/GTM\/FBP I believe this is an excellent option. Once when I used plugins for that I went trough couple and they were quite heavy for the only tasks that they have.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/light-and-smart.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/light-and-smart\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2348699","caption":"Plugin Light and Smart settings page"}},"tags":{"clean":"clean","lean":"lean","lighten":"lighten","optimize":"Optimize","remove":"remove"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"https:\/\/extremo.dev","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/light-and-smart\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2348699","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/light-and-smart\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=2348699"}}
