Connecting your preferred gateway to vcita is super easy!\n\nMaybe this being trial software is buried somewhere in the description. Maybe the Square integration is buried somewhere too. Maybe the unadvertised features are awesome. But combine them all &amp; it's hard to get a warm fuzzy.

I loved it so much I instantly signed up and tested it, it worked great. 2 weeks later, I upgrade to the premium version as I really wanted to take advantage of everything. <\/p>\n<p>I'm a Microsoft Outlook Expert, people search the internet for \"Outlook Expert\" and find my website that has the vCita plug-in, which instantly adds a more professional appeal. I used to get emails from clients, now instead I get bookings right away and comments that lead to sales. Since last February, I have over 800 bookings and many more comments. vCita also has saved me many hours of booking appointments with my prepay clients and just over all, no more \"Let's find a time...\" back and forth. Now I just send them my link and it's in their hands to find a good time. I can't even believe I worked without it this long. <\/p>\n<p>The plug-in is so awesome, I put it in all of my SEO blogs as well as my main website www.callthatgirl.biz and I use the pop up, which attracts folks to get on my calendar. <\/p>\n<p>AAAAA++++++.
