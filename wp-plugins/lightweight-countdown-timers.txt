The plugin ads a timers section in the main menu. Here you can create multiple timers with a few simple settings. When saved, the shortcodes to show the timer in the frontend are showed.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally you can use a shortcode to show content only before, or after the deadline of the timer.<\/p>\n<h4>Timezone for the timers<\/h4>\n<p>The timers always use the timezone set in your WordPress setting, keep this in mind when setting the deadline.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='can%20i%20add%20multiple%20countdown%20timers%3F'>\nCan I add multiple countdown timers?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can create as many timers as you like.
