Once the checkout is complete (or the user cancels), the user will be redirected back to your site to a customizable thank you page.<\/p>\n<h4>Pricing<\/h4>\n<p>We&#8217;re committed to making this the easiest to use payment solution for WordPress available so we&#8217;ve set it up so you&#8217;ll only be charged for using this service when you make money.<\/p>\n<p>Using our secure servers with Stripe costs 4.9% + 30\u00a2 per successful transaction.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you successfully charge someone $20 then after fees you&#8217;ll collect $18.72 \u2014 which Stripe will automatically deposit directly into your bank account.<\/p>\n<p>The fee above already includes Stripe&#8217;s fee (2.9% + 30\u00a2) &#8212; we just add an additional 2.0% for the use of our secure servers &#8212; which makes a grand total of 4.9% + 30\u00a2 per successful transaction.<\/p>\n<h4>Why is there a small fee (in addition to Stripe&#8217;s fees) when using Buy Now Plus in the first place?<\/h4>\n<p>Unlike other stripe payment plugins for WordPress, Buy Now Plus does not require you to install an SSL Certificate on your site. This is because we use our secure servers to process payments through Stripe. Our servers cost money to maintain &amp; secure &#8230; hence, we must charge a small fee for this service.<\/p>\n<p>So before using this plugin you just have to do the math. For some users the small per transaction fee will be a cost savings (particularly for those who&#8217;s web host charge for SSL) and for others, the convenience \/ ease of use of Buy Now Plus will be worth the small fee.<\/p>\n<h4>How can I run test transactions through this system?<\/h4>\n<p>When you create a payment form with Buy Now Plus you can easily specify whether transactions created with it should be test or live transactions (using the livemode attribute). There are no fees (from Stripe or our servers) for running test transactions.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend setting up forms initially in test mode to get the payment flow working properly before charging real transactions. Once you&#8217;re satisfied that the payment flow works for you then it&#8217;s easy to set the form to live by changing the value of the livemode attribute from &#8220;false&#8221; to &#8220;true&#8221;.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>All you&#8217;ll need to do to get this setup is<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Register for a free account on buynowplus.com<\/li>\n<li>Connect your Stripe account <\/li>\n<li>Find your API key on the settings page and get ready to copy and paste<\/li>\n<li>Download &amp; Install the Buy Now Plus WordPress plugin<\/li>\n<li>Enter the API key from your buynowplus.com settings into the Buy Now Plus settings page in the WordPress admin<\/li>\n<li>Use the &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; button in the WordPress editor to place a shortcode on any page of your site<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>That&#8217;s it!<\/p>\n<p>And you can use this on an unlimited number of sites after you have your API key.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Validated with 5.2.2<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Some features would be added<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"3 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"3\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/yiggory\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9d638820b38fb68fa95e563c4ee1e3f4?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9d638820b38fb68fa95e563c4ee1e3f4?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/yiggory\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">gameslopedy <small>(yiggory)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>This plugin is cool but I think it has some shortcoming:<\/p>\n<p>- There is no statistics on buynowplus.com , we cannot see the transaction is failed or not<br \/>\n- Checkout form display must be develop for quality visualization<br \/>\n- I also cannot see the stats on my stripe account events too.<br \/>\n- Some credit cards may be require name and last name, zip code fields, you may be make require them\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Saved me!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/usuaggie\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/dcceb5cc345b1d36d924502e52a8f74c?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/dcceb5cc345b1d36d924502e52a8f74c?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/usuaggie\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">usuaggie<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>I have been selling an electronic accessory locally at trade shows, but it recently started gaining traction from folks in other states.<\/p>\n<p>I needed a way for them to buy it through social media and wanted something simple on my site for them to purchase through as well.
