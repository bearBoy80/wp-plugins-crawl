With many other platforms, anyone can just write a review about you, without having bought anything.<\/p>\n<p>We stand for honesty. But real honesty. That&#8217;s why we only allow people to leave a review who have received an order from your store.<\/p>\n<p>If you are not yet using ReviewPack, <a href=\"https:\/\/reviewpack.eu\/join?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=wordpress&amp;utm_campaign=wp_plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">creating an account is 100% free<\/a> and only takes you about 30 seconds.<\/p>\n<h3>Automated invites with WooCommerce reviews<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin has a free integration with your WooCommerce store. This means that an invitation will only be sent to your customer after the order has been completed. This review invitation will not be sent until you change the order status to Completed. The invitation for the review will then be scheduled in 4 days.<\/p>\n<p>With this WooCommerce reviews implementation you can really increase the number of conversions which can lead to more sales. You can also add widgets on your site, which helps to increase sales.<\/p>\n<h3>Display review widgets<\/h3>\n<p>Another benefit of this plugin is the ease to implement the review widgets. These widgets can be implemented by using a simple shortcode. All shortcodes are displayed in the WP Admin (ReviewPack -&gt; Widgets).<\/p>\n<p>A widget displays the amount of reviews and your current company score. This will help to convert leads into customers and raise your conversion rates.<\/p>\n<h3>Improve your review SEO<\/h3>\n<p>With this plugin, you can not only gather reviews from your customers, but we will also add the required markup for the search engines. This will boost your reviews SEO, with our automated JSON+LD markup.<\/p>\n<p>The review markup is used by poplar search engines. They will interpret the code and might show them in the search results.<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/reviewpack-reviews\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2483056\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/reviewpack-reviews\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2483056\" alt=\"Display beautiful review widgets which boost your conversion rates.\"><\/a><p>Display beautiful review widgets which boost your conversion rates.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/reviewpack-reviews\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2483056\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/reviewpack-reviews\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2483056\" alt=\"Integrate with WooCommerce for automated invites.\"><\/a><p>Integrate with WooCommerce for automated invites.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">I helped develop it, but I also use it myself!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/petervw\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1c3eb9bf7491e0dc3a7190e2ad85f4de?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1c3eb9bf7491e0dc3a7190e2ad85f4de?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/petervw\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">petervw<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">March 1, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><em>Disclosure: ik heb geholpen bij de ontwikkeling van deze plugin<\/em>\n\nDespite being involved in the development of this plugin, I also use it for my clients myself.
