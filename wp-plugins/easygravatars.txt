The gravatar image is keyed to your email address, so<br \/>\nthat it is unique to you.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin will display gravatars for the people who comment on your posts.<br \/>\nYou do not need to modify any of your template files &#8212; just activate the<br \/>\nplugin, and it will add gravatars to your comments template automatically.<\/p>\n<h3>Credits<\/h3>\n<p>Based on a code snippet from Matt Mullenweg:<br \/>\n  http:\/\/photomatt.net\/2007\/10\/20\/gravatar-enabled\/<br \/>\n  http:\/\/pastebin.ca\/743979<\/p>\n<p>Props to David Potter for pointing out that Gravatar normalizes email<br \/>\naddresses to lowercase before hashing with MD5:<br \/>\n  http:\/\/dpotter.net\/Technical\/index.php\/2007\/10\/22\/integrating-gravatar-support\/<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Copy the easygravatars folder and its contents to your wp-content\/plugins<br \/>\ndirectory, then activate the plugin.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin will add a new Easy Gravatars section under the Options menu.<br \/>\nThere, you can configure the size and maximum rating of the gravatars that<br \/>\nyou wish to display. You can also set the location of a default image to<br \/>\ndisplay for users who have no gravatar (the default is a 1px transparent<br \/>\ngif), you can tweak the CSS for the wrapper around the image, and you can<br \/>\nselect to attach the gravatar to either the comment author link, or the text<br \/>\nof the comment.<\/p>\n<p>By default, the gravatar is floated to the right of the comment author&#8217;s<br \/>\nname, which should work well with most templates.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>I have a Gravatar, but it doesn&#8217;t appear<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Gravatar service allows you to register multiple email addresses. Make<br \/>\nsure that the email address you use in your WordPress comments matches an<br \/>\nemail address registered on the Gravatar server.<\/p>\n<p>Also, check the rating of your gravatar versus the maximum allowed rating in<br \/>\nthe Easy Gravatar options. If your gravatar is rated &#8216;R&#8217;, but you set the<br \/>\nmaximum Easy Gravatar rating to &#8216;PG&#8217;, the image will be blocked.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Some people see Gravatars, but others don&#8217;t<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>In some cases, there have been reports that Internet Explorer 6.0 does not<br \/>\ndisplay gravatars properly. This is probably due to CSS bugs in IE6. I will<br \/>\ntry to isolate this as time allows, but the best advice is for users to<br \/>\nupgrade to IE7 (for security and better standards support), or to use<br \/>\nanother browser, like Firefox or Opera.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>My comment author links disappear<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You may have another plugin which is conflicting with Easy Gravatars. In<br \/>\nparticular, Joost de Valk&#8217;s Google Analytics plugin version 1.3 also tried<br \/>\nto modify the comment author link. Upgrade to version 1.4 or higher of his<br \/>\nplugin, or select the &#8220;Comment Text&#8221; API hook in Easy Gravatar&#8217;s Advanced<br \/>\nOptions.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Gravatars appear, but&#8230;<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The placement of the Gravatars within your comments template is controlled<br \/>\nby the <code>Span style<\/code> and <code>API hook<\/code> options. The gravatar is rendered as an<br \/>\nimage tag within a span, which is prepended to either the comment author<br \/>\ninformation or the text of the comment, depending on the hook selected.<\/p>\n<p>The default options should work fine with most WordPress templates, but<br \/>\nthere&#8217;s always the chance that a template with a complex layout might have a<br \/>\nconflict. If simply changing the API hook selection doesn&#8217;t give a result<br \/>\nwhich is to your liking, you will need to modify the CSS in the span style.<\/p>\n<p>Sorry, but help with CSS styling is beyond the scope of this document.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Doesn&#8217;t WordPress 2.5 have Gravatars built-in? Why do I need Easy Gravatars?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, WordPress 2.5 added native support for Gravatars. However, older themes<br \/>\ndon&#8217;t support them. If you are using a theme which doesn&#8217;t already support<br \/>\nadding Gravatars, you either need to modify the templates yourself, or use<br \/>\nEasy Gravatars to add them automatically for you.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.3      2010-01-14<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested compatibility up to WordPress 3.0-a<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2      2008-03-06<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>When running under WordPress 2.5, use the built-in Gravatar image functions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1      2007-11-16<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Gravatar images now link to comment author&#8217;s URL, if provided.<\/li>\n<li>Gravatar code now prepended to text instead of appended.<\/li>\n<li>Code reorganized.
