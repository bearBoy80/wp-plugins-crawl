There are some additional steps you need to take in order to make it work, which are not mentioned here. But will pop up when you are installing it.\n1. You need to change the page slug\n2. You'll need to add an additional file to your site and add text to it\n3. In addition I'm not sure that when adding a new page, if it will show up by accident on your navigation menu, and you might have to remove it from the list.\n\nThe plugin itself works as advertised. After everything is set up. If a visitor has visited your site before. And they try to reach you while being offline. They will get the message.\n\nDespite its shortcomings in documentation. I give this plugin full marks, because I'm assuming that people who are technically savvy will be the only ones trying this out. And they will find their way with using it.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Love<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/nguyenvanduocit\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e8e44883053a46d4a9255c230fe78824?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e8e44883053a46d4a9255c230fe78824?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/nguyenvanduocit\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Duoc Nguyen <small>(nguyenvanduocit)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 7, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">If you love it, please vote<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-offline-fallback.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"errors":"errors","offline":"offline","plugins":"plugins","service-worker":"service worker"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"http:\/\/laptrinh.senviet.org","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-offline-fallback\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1545140","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-offline-fallback\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1545140"}}
