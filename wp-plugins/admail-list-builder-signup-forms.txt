You can add signup forms to blog posts, site pages, the sidebar, or multiple landing pages. You can also set it to open automatically as a popup modal when customers land on a page. Just grab the Shortcode from your Admail.net account, insert it into the plugin admin settings, and you&#8217;re ready to go.<\/p>\n<p>Signup forms that are good looking, user-friendly and mobile optimized.
