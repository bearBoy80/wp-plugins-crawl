After other developers were failed to solve this complicated issue, i contacted Google feed manager Plugin support. Their most patient and professional team surprised me to solve this issue with ease.  <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Thank you very much<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Super plugin and support.

But wait, it's not what you think! Due to another plugin I had been using allowing me to take lazy man shortcuts, I had no idea my product mappings were all wrong, incomplete and inconsistent. When I switched to this plugin I found out that my brands, ganders, sizes etc hadn't been linked to WooCommerce in the correct way in the slightest, and I just didn't have the experience to have noticed. I asked a question of the plugin author due to a difficulty I was having mapping attributes, and I received a prompt response packed with good information. It made a switch click in my head about how attributes should be mapped in Woo, and the whole feed mapping procedure I was introduced to by this plugin finally let me CORRECTLY assign &amp; show sizes, colours, genders etc so that they actually show on my website &amp; perhaps more importantly- Google! Huzzah! Due to this revelational realisation, I did have to go back and re-do every single store product attribute field the correct way, hence the misleading introduction! That's obviously no fault of Feed Manager, and my whole life is now less frustrating on the website &amp; Google side of things. Plugin has operated faultlessly for several weeks now and auto generates &amp; syncs my refreshed product feeds every night like clockwork.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\"><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Bravo!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\"><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Lookin' at you Auke :)<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Perfect Plugin - Great support!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/paulschiretz\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6dd38c72d9423bf53ff8aad175dc7368?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6dd38c72d9423bf53ff8aad175dc7368?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/paulschiretz\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Paul <small>(paulschiretz)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 11, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">I use this plugin since 2 years now, does the job really well never any serious issue!
