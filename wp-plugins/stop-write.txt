You can prevent changes to your wp-admin, wp-content, wp-includes directories. Use this plugin if you got a nasty virus making changes to your site, cos it won&#8217;t be able to make changes if the site is non writable. There are some cons though, you won&#8217;t be able to upgrade if the site is completely non writable. When you do want to upgrade, make everything writable beforehand.<\/p>\n<p>Built by The Marketing Mix Perth: https:\/\/www.marketingmix.com.au<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>1) Install WordPress 5.6 or higher<\/p>\n<p>2) Download the latest from:<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/stop-write<\/p>\n<p>3) Login to WordPress admin, click on Plugins \/ Add New \/ Upload, then upload the zip file you just downloaded.<\/p>\n<p>4) Activate the plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Built by The Marketing Mix Perth: https:\/\/www.marketingmix.com.au<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Able to now control file permissions for htaccess and wp-config.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Commit<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">LOVE THIS PLUGIN<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/smpn\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/920746333f46bcc05f7a2580de5f6fa1?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/920746333f46bcc05f7a2580de5f6fa1?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/smpn\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">smpn<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 25, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This plugin will stop your website database from being defaced!\n\nPlease developer dont stop working on this plugin.\n\nThank you for sharing this plugin with us.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/stop-write.2.0.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"lock":"lock","permission":"permission","permissions":"permissions","security":"security","unlock":"unlock"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/stop-write.1.0.zip","2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/stop-write.2.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/stop-write.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
