Anyway copy the list of tags, and try to insert it again this time the plugin would insert the tags that were not inserted in the first round.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What happens if i tries to insert tags that are already in the database?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whenever you try to insert tags the plugin will tell you the number of tags that were successfully inserted, and will show you a list of tags that were not inserted &#8211; so you can know which tags where already there.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What is the use of that PHP Callback optional function?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This function will be called on each tag you insert, allowing you to progrmatically modifiy the slug or the name of the tag.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why i can&#8217;t edit the filter-tags file directly in the settings page?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>For the securirty of your website i made the view of that file a read-only view.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can i use this plugin to add terms from other taxonomies?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>For the moment this plugin works only with tags, however it is easy to customize it to work with other taxonomies. If i see requests for such a feature i may add it in the future.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/quick-bulk-tags-creator\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1848429\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/quick-bulk-tags-creator\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1848429\" alt=\"Settings page\"><\/a><p>Settings page<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/quick-bulk-tags-creator\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1848429\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/quick-bulk-tags-creator\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1848429\" alt=\"Edit tags page\"><\/a><p>Edit tags page<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Perfect plugin!

It's so easy to use. I even add 20.000 tags once a time and it did in seconds.\n\nI totally suggest to ue this plugin, gladly.\n\nThank you so much for the developer.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/quick-bulk-tags-creator.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/quick-bulk-tags-creator\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1848429","caption":"Settings page"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/quick-bulk-tags-creator\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1848429","caption":"Edit tags page"}},"tags":{"post-tags":"post tags","tags":"tags","taxonomies":"taxonomies","terms":"terms"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/quick-bulk-tags-creator\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1848429","high":false}}
