You can then serve that media through a CDN like Amazon Cloud front, Cloudflare, Fastly and others.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond cloud storage, Media Cloud also has deep integration with Imgix, the leading real-time image manipulation and optimization CDN.  Media Cloud is the first plugin for WordPress to bring the full benefit of what Imgix offers &#8211; simplifying your development efforts, reducing your site\u2019s page load times and opening up creative options that simply haven\u2019t existed until now.<\/p>\n<p>Media Cloud also provides advanced image editing tools that provide improved cropping options, effects, filters, watermarking and more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOTE<\/strong>: This plugin requires PHP 7.1 or higher<\/p>\n<h4>Upload to S3, Cloudflare R2, Minio, Google Cloud Storage, Digital Ocean Spaces, DreamHost Object Storage and others<\/h4>\n<p>Automatically copy media uploads to the cloud and serve them directly from your cloud storage provider, CloudFront or any other CDN.<\/p>\n<h4>Video Encoding with Mux<\/h4>\n<p>Upload videos and encode them nearly instantly to adaptive bitrate HLS that plays back smoothly and beautifully on any device regardless of bandwidth.

If you just use the S3 functionality of this plugin, you are already one step ahead.  Using S3, all of your media is centrally located in one place that you can then distribute through a high performing content delivery network to improve page load speeds for your site.  You also don&#8217;t have to worry about disk space on your servers anymore.<\/p>\n<p>Imgix is a content delivery network with a twist.  In addition to distributing your media, it also allows you to edit them, in real-time. and deliver the edited version through their CDN without altering the original.  Want to add a new image size to your theme?  You can do this with Imgix without having to use a plugin to recut all of your existing media to this new size.  Imgix optimizes format delivery and a bunch of other things.  It&#8217;s seriously the greatest thing to happen to WordPress and web development in the history of ever.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>4.5.24 &#8211; 09\/27\/2023<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix Clean Uploads task to deal with crusty databases that have URLs in the _wp_attached_file meta field.<\/li>\n<li>Added <code>media-cloud\/storage\/verify\/settings<\/code> filter to enable skipping cloud storage settings verification.

If you run into<br \/>\nissues with this, you can set a toggle in the settings to always include the scripts.

This support is only provided for specific development scenarios, you should not<br \/>\nuse Supabase Storage for general purpose storage because you think it&#8217;s inexpensive.

Now, you can now upload PDFs of any size without issues (subject to WordPress and web server limitations).<\/li>\n<li>PDF upload speed should be greatly improved.  If you don&#8217;t care about generating PDF preview images, you can improve it even more by turning off <strong>Extract PDF Page Size<\/strong> in the <strong>Image and PDF Upload Handling<\/strong> section of <strong>Cloud Storage Settings<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Added a new setting <strong>Background Only When Using the Media Library<\/strong> that, when enabled, limits image optimizations to only run in the background when using the WordPress Media Library pages in the admin, otherwise the image optimizations will run during the upload.  Enabling this could improve compatibility with some plugins.<\/li>\n<li>Image Optimizations that fail would prevent the upload from being transferred to cloud storage.

Note that heartbeats are only sent by administrator level users or users with the <code>mcloud_heartbeat<\/code> permission.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a javascript error with the real time debug log viewer.<\/li>\n<li>Rebuild thumbnails will now correctly rebuild thumbnails when Imgix is enabled.<\/li>\n<li>Minor UI tweaks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>4.2.35 &#8211; 6\/17\/2021<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed Replace Image functionality which would fail to work on certain versions of MySQL due to an SQL query being used being not compatible.<\/li>\n<li>Added a drop down to control how tags are managed when replacing an image.  Controls if they should be merged, replaced or do nothing.  Default is Replace.<\/li>\n<li>Replacing an image now replaces the title of the attachment.<\/li>\n<li>Removed option to delete media after migration because too many people were shooting themselves in the foot.  After a successful migration, it&#8217;s important you check to make sure your media has been migrated successfully and then run a Clean Uploads task after to remove files from your server.<\/li>\n<li>Removed <code>--delete-migrated<\/code> from <code>wp mediacloud:storage migrateToCloud<\/code> command.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a warning for <code>Logger.php<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>4.2.34 &#8211; 6\/17\/2021<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a toggle to make the <strong>Debug Log<\/strong> display log entries in realtime.<\/li>\n<li>Added a toggle to <strong>Batch Processing<\/strong> settings that allows you to disable your theme and any plugins when processing items in the background.

When enabled, private images, or image sizes that have had<br \/>\ntheir privacy level set to private, will be rendered through imgix.

Media Cloud now will support any Elementor addon and running the<br \/>\n<strong>Elementor Update Task<\/strong> is super safe.  Instead of the brute force text search\/replace we were doing before, we are<br \/>\nnow analyzing every installed Elementor widget&#8217;s properties for images to update and then walking your Elementor post<br \/>\nor page&#8217;s structure to update accordingly.<\/li>\n<li>Rewrote the Storage Browser from the ground up.  Much much much faster and can now handle buckets of any size and<br \/>\nfile count.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Update Elementor<\/strong> task now generates a report on what was replaced\/updated on your Elementor pages\/posts.<\/li>\n<li>Support for custom sizes in images in Elementor.<\/li>\n<li>New integration for Google Web Stories.  If you use Google Web Stories, you may need to run the &#8220;Update Web Stories&#8221;<br \/>\ntask to make sure all of your URLs are correct.  You should only have to run this task once, though you will need to<br \/>\nrun it again anytime you change Media Cloud&#8217;s config in such a way that it changes the URLs to your images.<\/li>\n<li>Fix for &#8220;dynamically&#8221; resized images using Imgix that ignored the image&#8217;s default parameters set in the image editor.<\/li>\n<li>Fix for URL replacement where two or more of the same images at different sizes were being replaced by a single size<br \/>\nwhen using the classic editor.<\/li>\n<li>When adding media to a post that links to the original media, we are now replacing those URLs as well.  You can turn<br \/>\nthis off in <strong>Cloud Storage Settings<\/strong> in the <strong>URL Replacement<\/strong> category.<\/li>\n<li>Disable optimizers during migrate task to prevent certain images from being skipped.<\/li>\n<li>Fix for built-in ShortPixel optimization<\/li>\n<li>Fixed Unlink From Cloud task not scrubbing all S3 metadata<\/li>\n<li>Fix for imgix urls being double urlencoded<\/li>\n<li>Fix for image sizes in gallery blocks in Gutenberg<\/li>\n<li>PHP 8 compatibility fixes<\/li>\n<li>Fix for direct uploads going to unicode directory names<\/li>\n<li>CLI commands have been &#8220;namespaced&#8221; and some names have changed.

This is a good first step prior to migrating your library for the first time to<br \/>\nsee if you are missing any local files which may cause your migration to fail.<\/li>\n<li>Added new setting toggle <strong>Replace URLs<\/strong> in <strong>Cloud Storage Settings<\/strong> that allows you to turn off Media Cloud&#8217;s<br \/>\nrealtime URL replacement.  If you&#8217;ve been using Media Cloud since day zero of your WordPress site (you haven&#8217;t<br \/>\nmigrated an existing site) and haven&#8217;t changed any settings which would change the URL for your cloud storage since<br \/>\nthen (for example adding a CDN or enabling imgix), you may be able to turn this setting off.   Note that the URL<br \/>\nreplacement overhead is very minimal to begin with so the potential performance gain won&#8217;t be noticeable in most cases.<\/li>\n<li>When Debugging is enabled, Media Cloud will now log to Query Monitor&#8217;s log if you have that plugin installed<br \/>\nand activated.<\/li>\n<li>Added <strong>Reset Task Data<\/strong> to the Task Manager to clear out all task data from the database, aka the nuclear option.<\/li>\n<li>Added Report Viewer to view the reports that the various tasks that Media Cloud runs produces.<\/li>\n<li>Added new CLI command <code>wp mediacloud:storage replace<\/code> which will search and replace URLs in your database.  When used<br \/>\nin conjunction with the new <strong>Replace URLs<\/strong> toggle in <strong>Cloud Storage Settings<\/strong> you can minimize all of the work<br \/>\nthat Media Cloud is doing on the front end to make sure that URLs are correct.  <strong><em>There are a lot of caveats to using<br \/>\nthis command<\/em><\/strong>.

Since the first days of Media Cloud, we&#8217;ve been using the <code>authenticated-read<\/code><br \/>\nACL for private cloud storage uploads.  There was a historical reason for that and functionally there is no difference<br \/>\nbetween <code>authenticated-read<\/code> and <code>private<\/code> ACLs for nearly all cloud storage providers.  If you are using Scaleway and have<br \/>\nprivate uploads enabled, make sure you change the privacy settings from Authenticated Read to Private.  For other<br \/>\ncloud storage providers you do not need to do this, but we suggest you do.  You will also need to change the privacy on<br \/>\nany existing private uploads by going to the Media Library, switching to list view, filtering on <code>Authenticated Read<\/code><br \/>\nand then doing a bulk action <code>Change Privacy to Private<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Added the ability to specify a custom region.  Mostly useful for S3 compatible cloud storage providers, but also useful<br \/>\nwhen Amazon released a new region and their is a lag time for us updating our list.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed changing ACL on the attachment edit screen to update the ACL for any generated image sizes.<\/li>\n<li>Fix for direct uploading non-image files when using the &#8220;Add New&#8221; page in WordPress admin.<\/li>\n<li>Added a new debugging mode that will generate a CSV log file of URL replacements on a given page.  Enable it by going to<br \/>\n<strong>Media Cloud -&gt; Debug Settings<\/strong> and toggle on <strong>Debug Content Filtering<\/strong>.  Visit a page that you are having issues<br \/>\nwith and a log file will be generated in your <code>WP-CONTENT\/mcloud-reports<\/code> directory.  DO NOT LEAVE THIS RUNNING.

It still does, but you can make it honor it by setting the Upload File Prefix setting to an empty value or return FALSE from the new <code>ilab_storage_should_use_custom_prefix<\/code> filter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.20<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed EWWW Image Optimizer compatibility<\/li>\n<li>Fixed compatibility with Offload S3 when transition to Media Cloud from that plugin<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a bug for when you have the <code>wp-cli\/wp-cli<\/code> package installed via composer when using Bedrock<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.19<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Completely revamped the importer, thumbnail regeneration and batch rekognition processor.<\/li>\n<li>Added a setting in Storage Settings that allows you to specify the connection timeout for background processing for the importer and other batch tools.  This could be helpful in some hosting situations.  If you&#8217;ve been getting the <code>cURL 28<\/code> error, try increasing this setting.<\/li>\n<li>Added a setting in Storage Settings to do the batch importing in the browser, instead of in the background on the server.  This is more reliable as the browser is directing the batch, <strong>HOWEVER<\/strong>, you cannot close the browser window while a batch is running.  If you cannot get background batch processing working, turn this on.<\/li>\n<li>Revamped the importer interface.  It now shows the thumbnail of the image that it currently being processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.18<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP 5.6 related fixes.<\/li>\n<li>Added PHP version compatibilty check to the Troubleshooter tool<\/li>\n<li>The Troubleshooter tool is always enabled (as long as Storage is enabled)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.17<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added toggle to serve images from your storage provider using signed URLs (S3 only right now)<\/li>\n<li>Add option to serve GIFs from S3 (or whatever storage provider) instead of Imgix, if you have Imgix enabled.  Animated GIFs are a premium Imgix feature, so this option works around that a little.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.16<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for image_intermediate_size for imgix URLs (thanks Tobias Alex-Petersen)<\/li>\n<li>Fix for image scaling (thanks Tobias Alex-Petersen)<\/li>\n<li>Support for WordPress&#8217;s crop positions (thanks Zac M-W)<\/li>\n<li>Support for defining default imgix parameters for sizes. Instead of using <code>add_image_size($name, $width, $height, $crop)<\/code>, use <code>addImigixImageSize($name, $width, $height, $crop, $imgixParams)<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>System report now includes active plugins and active must use plugins<\/li>\n<li>Before running the importer, or bulk rebuilding thumbnails, first test that we can access the server without any issues.  If there is an issue it is displayed as an error to the end user.<\/li>\n<li>Added Troubleshooter page that will help you troubleshoot any basic setup problems you might be having.  To turn on, enabled Media Cloud Debugging and then navigate to &#8220;Troubleshooter&#8221; in the admin navigation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.15<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added compatibility for ShortPixel Image Optimizer<\/li>\n<li>Added compatibility for EWW Image Optimizer<\/li>\n<li>Added compatibility for Smush Image Optimizer (Note: Smush is not compatible with Media Cloud when using Imgix).<\/li>\n<li>Added compatibility for Imagify Image Optimizer (The best we tested, btw)<\/li>\n<li>Ability to keep WordPress generated thumbnails when using Imgix<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.14<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Media Cloud debugging now logs to database, no need to configure php.ini.<\/li>\n<li>Improved stablity of the importer.  Even if one item fails to import, the rest should continue processing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.13<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Skipped for superstitious reasons<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.12<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Version bump to match github<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.11<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a cropping related bug<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.10<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Using WordPress&#8217;s image editor now works with Media Cloud.  Crops, rotations, etc. will be re-uploaded to S3.<\/li>\n<li>Added more Rekognition regions<\/li>\n<li>When theme or plugin zip files are uploaded, skip handling them with Media Cloud<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility fixes for Foo Gallery, Master Slider, Photo Gallery, and Smart Slider 3<\/li>\n<li>Added warning and error notices for plugins that are incompatible with Media Cloud: NextGEN Gallery, Smush.it, ShortPixel Image Optimizer, MetaSlider, Imagify, and EWWW Image Optimizer.<\/li>\n<li>Updated FAQ<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for bbPress front-end user uploads.  Should fix issues with other front-end user uploads too.<\/li>\n<li>Added warning for BuddyPress.  Imgix features of the plugin and BuddyPress are not compatible.  BuddyPress does some strange upload stuff and is a convoluted mess.  I tried, but I gave up.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for importer.  Imported file&#8217;s directory structure is retained when importing into S3.<\/li>\n<li>Fix for compatibility with WooCommerce and a lot of other plugins<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for crop tool<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix URL for PDF uploads<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated PDF library<\/li>\n<li>Added better Google Cloud instructions (thanks @michaeljberry)<\/li>\n<li>Fix ILAB_AWS_S3_BUCKET_PREFIX environment variable (thanks @JulienMelissas)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added &#8216;flip&#8217; imgix parameter to the image editor<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for Wasabi (https:\/\/wasabi.com) storage service<\/li>\n<li>Direct uploads via Wasabi (requires Imgix)<\/li>\n<li>Fix for direct uploads failing<\/li>\n<li>Fix for CSS issues on settings pages<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for detecting faces using Imgix&#8217;s API.  You can enable this setting in the Imgix settings.  With the detected faces, you can use those in the <code>Focus Crop<\/code> settings of the image editor.  <strong>Note<\/strong> that Rekognition does a vastly superior job in detecting faces (sorry Imgix) and I would urge you to use that instead.  But if you aren&#8217;t using Amazon S3 for storage, you&#8217;ll have to use the Imgix face detection if you want to use the Focus Crop feature.<\/li>\n<li>Added support for Imgix&#8217;s Entropy and Edges cropping modes (https:\/\/docs.imgix.com\/apis\/url\/size\/crop).  You can access these in the image editor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for Imgix&#8217;s Focal Point Cropping (read about it here: https:\/\/docs.imgix.com\/apis\/url\/size\/crop).  Right now it only supports focal cropping to a point, however it can use faces that have been detected with the Amazon Rekognition feature of the plugin.  Yes, I know, Imgix has this feature using their face detection and I will add it in the future!<\/li>\n<li>To use the new Focal Point Cropping, click on <code>Edit Image<\/code> in attachment details to open up the Imgix Image Editor.  Click on the &#8220;Focus Crop&#8221; tab and go to town.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added WP-CLI support<\/li>\n<li>Added WP-CLI command <code>wp mediacloud import<\/code> to import the media library to cloud storage from the command line.<\/li>\n<li>Added WP-CLI command <code>wp mediacloud regenerate<\/code> to rebuild thumbnails for cloud storage from the command line.<\/li>\n<li>Added WP-CLI command <code>wp rekognition process<\/code> to run the media library through Amazon Rekognition from the command line.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for PHP 5.6.  Was using a couple of PHP 7.x features.<\/li>\n<li>Slimmed down the size of the plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for uploading non-image files.  This bug was introduced in 2.0.3.  If you&#8217;ve uploaded non-image files since then, you&#8217;ll need to re-upload them.  Sorry!<\/li>\n<li>Hovering over the cloud icon when in the media library grid will display storage info about that file<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Greatly enhanced the Storage Info panel on the attachment details edit page.  This now shows you all of the different sizes that have been generated, as well as any that might be missing.<\/li>\n<li>Added the ability to rebuild thumbnails.  If you are using Imgix, this is unnecessary.  If you aren&#8217;t using Imgix, you should be using Imgix.  You&#8217;re never going to do better than Imgix.  Relying on WordPress to resize your images and then serve those images from a CDN tied to your cloud storage is a better choice than just serving everything from WordPress, but you are still inserting management tasks into your workflow that Imgix alleviates entirely.  Seriously, check it out.  If you still want to persist with this madness, then this new thumbnail regeneration feature is built just for you.  Enjoy.<\/li>\n<li>Added &#8220;Regenerate Thumbnails&#8221; bulk action to WordPress&#8217;s media library list view.  Use Imgix and you&#8217;ll never have to worry about this stuff ever again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for bug when deleting from remote storage<\/li>\n<li>Fix for CDN URL not being applied<\/li>\n<li>Documentation fix<\/li>\n<li>Settings clean up<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for srcset not being generated on WordPress generated image tags.  Note that this will only fix future uploads, not existing uploads.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Major refactoring of the code base<\/li>\n<li>Storage services are now &#8220;pluggable&#8221;, meaning new ones can be added that aren&#8217;t S3 compatible<\/li>\n<li>Added native Google Cloud Storage support<\/li>\n<li>Direct uploads to Google Cloud Storage<\/li>\n<li>Added native Backblaze B2 support<\/li>\n<li>Improved support for other S3 compatible services<\/li>\n<li>Other misc. fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Major refactoring of the code base<\/li>\n<li>Storage services are now &#8220;pluggable&#8221;, meaning new ones can be added that aren&#8217;t S3 compatible<\/li>\n<li>Added native Google Cloud Storage support<\/li>\n<li>Direct uploads to Google Cloud Storage<\/li>\n<li>Added native Backblaze B2 support<\/li>\n<li>Improved support for other S3 compatible services<\/li>\n<li>Other misc. fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enabled Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration for even faster uploads.  You should enable this ASAP.<\/li>\n<li>Direct uploads to Minio storage servers now work (still requires Imgix).<\/li>\n<li>Fix for missing mime_content_type() errors on misconfigured PHP installs<\/li>\n<li>Added path style endpoint option for S3 compatible endpoints<\/li>\n<li>Misc. fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Rekognition importer utility for running existing media on S3 through Rekognition<\/li>\n<li>Added bulk actions for S3 importing and Rekognition processing to the WordPress media library<\/li>\n<li>Added S3 icon overlay in the media library (grid mode)<\/li>\n<li>Added S3 column to the media library (list mode)<\/li>\n<li>Misc. fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for Amazon Rekognition for auto tagging and categorizing uploaded images<\/li>\n<li>Added debug for support tickets<\/li>\n<li>Misc. fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Upload media directly to S3, bypassing WordPress.  This feature requires Imgix.<\/li>\n<li>Ability to cancel S3 Importer<\/li>\n<li>Fixes to S3 importing<\/li>\n<li>Misc. fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility with S3-compatible services like Minio, Google Cloud Storage (when in interoperability mode) and Digital Ocean Spaces.  (thanks to Vladimir Pouzanov)<\/li>\n<li>Fix for S3 Importer on Windows (seriously stop hosting WordPress on Windows)<\/li>\n<li>Misc. fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed collision with Types plugin<\/li>\n<li>Added donation link.  If you find this plugin useful, PLEASE donate to my JDRF fund raiser for finding a cure for type 1 diabetes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added flag to skip bucket checks to avoid rate limiting errors from Amazon on media heavy sites<\/li>\n<li>Fixed the log spam for the isset offset error<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated AWS SDK to 3.26.5<\/li>\n<li>Fix for PDF upload bug<\/li>\n<li>Misc. bug fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix incompatibility with WP Rocket<\/li>\n<li>Fix for env() bug<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve new user on-boarding<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed plugin name<\/li>\n<li>Ability to import non-standard image types such as TIFF, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator (requires Imgix)<\/li>\n<li>Ability to render PDF as images (requires Imgix)<\/li>\n<li>Turn off auto-upload for non-image types<\/li>\n<li>Specify specific MIME types to NOT upload to S3<\/li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with Offload S3<\/li>\n<li>Added ilab_s3_upload_params filter for the ability to specify custom S3 metadata for each upload<\/li>\n<li>Ability to define custom ACL for uploads<\/li>\n<li>S3 info displayed in Attachment Details pop up modal<\/li>\n<li>S3 metabox added to Attachment edit pages, allowing you to edit the Cache-Control, Expires and ACL for the S3 upload<\/li>\n<li>Fix for cropping images on S3<\/li>\n<li>Other bug fixes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed plugin name<\/li>\n<li>Ability to import non-standard image types such as TIFF, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator (requires Imgix)<\/li>\n<li>Ability to render PDF as images (requires Imgix)<\/li>\n<li>Turn off auto-upload for non-image types<\/li>\n<li>Specify specific MIME types to NOT upload to S3<\/li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with Offload S3<\/li>\n<li>Added ilab_s3_upload_params filter for the ability to specify custom S3 metadata for each upload<\/li>\n<li>Ability to define custom ACL for uploads<\/li>\n<li>S3 info displayed in Attachment Details pop up modal<\/li>\n<li>S3 metabox added to Attachment edit pages, allowing you to edit the Cache-Control, Expires and ACL for the S3 upload<\/li>\n<li>Fix for cropping images on S3<\/li>\n<li>Other bug fixes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed plugin name<\/li>\n<li>Ability to import non-standard image types such as TIFF, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator (requires Imgix)<\/li>\n<li>Ability to render PDF as images (requires Imgix)<\/li>\n<li>Turn off auto-upload for non-image types<\/li>\n<li>Specify specific MIME types to NOT upload to S3<\/li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with Offload S3<\/li>\n<li>Added ilab_s3_upload_params filter for the ability to specify custom S3 metadata for each upload<\/li>\n<li>Ability to define custom ACL for uploads<\/li>\n<li>S3 info displayed in Attachment Details pop up modal<\/li>\n<li>S3 metabox added to Attachment edit pages, allowing you to edit the Cache-Control, Expires and ACL for the S3 upload<\/li>\n<li>Fix for cropping images on S3<\/li>\n<li>Other bug fixes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for importing non-image files to S3 with the importer tool<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to specify Cache-Control and Expires metadata for S3 uploads (thanks to metadan)<\/li>\n<li>Fix for @{versioning} bucket prefix token<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for admin notice dismissal when used with Bedrock<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for imgix admin notice<\/li>\n<li>Added filter for defining default imgix parameters (thanks to eightam)<\/li>\n<li>Fix for deleting files from S3 (thanks to Lotykun)<\/li>\n<li>Support for auto compress (thanks to JulienMelissas)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for image sizes disappearing in the insert media dialog.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug where SEO Framework and some other plugins were resizing images on the fly, causing an image to be<br \/>\ndownloaded to be resized.<\/li>\n<li>You can now specify a prefix to be prepended to file names when uploaded to S3.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved compatibility with other plugins that are using the AWS SDK.

With AWS S3 there is no delay in loading and media files are served immediately. You should be familiarized with AWS settings in order to manage all settings (check video tutorials on YouTube as the Media Cloud video tutorial is a bit outdated). Media Cloud also offers a support site where everything has been explained step by step. In my opinion, the developer has invested a huge amount of efforts creating this plugin and thanks to him Wordpress users count with a pretty simple solution to develop heavy projects.
