The best part is, this plugin doesn't use up a ton of resources to do it either!!<\/p>\n<p>Now I have a fairly complete suite of security software for my WordPress sites with the ability to generate logs and notices for both lockouts of bad users and valid user logins.  <\/p>\n<p>The only thing I wish this plugin had out of the box was two more variables for the email formatting, so I can send the user IP and the URL of the site in the emails as well.<br \/>\nThankfully the plugin is also simple enough that adding a <em>%USER_IP%<\/em> and <em>%SITE_URL%<\/em> replacement is easy too! <\/p>\n<p>Many thanks to the developer for doing the hard work for me!\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-login-notice.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"alert":"alert","login":"login","notice":"notice"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
