You need &#8220;CHMOD&#8221; the files to 755, or 777 just to be safe (That&#8217;s if you&#8217;re hosted on a Linux server, If you&#8217;re hosted on the Windows server you shouldn&#8217;t experience this problem)<\/p>\n<p>Which versions of PHP do I need?<br \/>\n&#8211; The community cloud will work on both php4 and php5, but it works best on php5. On php4 the cloud uses some web services.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<p>2.0:<\/p>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/community-cloud.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"cloud":"cloud","comments":"comments","community":"community","sidebar":"sidebar","widget":"widget"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/community-cloud.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/community-cloud.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/community-cloud.1.2.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
