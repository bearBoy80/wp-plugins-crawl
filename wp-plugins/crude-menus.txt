It can be difficult to set up and maintain menus with 50+ links.  It usually involves  looking for the post you&#8217;re trying to add, not finding it, remembering that the post is <em>actually<\/em> in the &#8220;article&#8221; custom post type so now you gotta go to that meta box and find it there, then drag-and-drop it to where you need it and and and&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be super if you could just put together a list of links and titles in something like Excel, paste that list into a textbox, and have WordPress create a menu based off of that?<\/p>\n<p>Well, now you can!<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/plugin-name<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Navigate to Appearances \/ CRUDE Menus.<\/li>\n<li>To create a menu, enter a unique menu name and the comma-separated list of pages you want to put as links in this menu.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Installation Instructions<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/plugin-name<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Navigate to Appearances \/ CRUDE Menus.<\/li>\n<li>To create a menu, enter a unique menu name and the comma-separated list of pages you want to put as links in this menu.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why do you call it &#8220;CRUDE Menus?&#8221;<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>CRUD is a common acronym in the database world &#8211; Create, Read, Update, Delete.

Just ask the Clampetts.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What can be imported for a menu item?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Link is mandatory; you can also import CSS class(es), Link Target (whether it opens in another tab), and a custom title.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What about integration with Nav Menu Roles, WP Mega Menu, Ubermenu, etc?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;d have to set that manually as well, through Appearance \/ Menus.  Menus created via CRUDE Menus will be standard WordPress menus, and will be able to be configured with other plugins just as if you had created them manually.  This plugin is designed to make creating large menus easier, but can&#8217;t bring in data for anything other than stock WordPress menu functions.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I use this to update existing navigation menus?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s planned for a future release.
