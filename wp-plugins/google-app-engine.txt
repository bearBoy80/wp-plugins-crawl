Batcache integrates with Memcache to cache your site on the App<br \/>\nEngine memcache server and will ensure that CloudSQL is used as little as<br \/>\npossible, reducing your costs.<\/p>\n<p>If you host a rarely updated site, we suggest adding the following configuration<br \/>\nto your <code>wp-config.php<\/code>:<\/p>\n<pre><code>$batcache = [\n    'seconds' =&gt; 0,\n    'max_age' =&gt; 60 * 30,  \/\/ 30 minutes.\n];\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This will cache pages on your site for a year and ensure that they do not expire<br \/>\nin memcache.
