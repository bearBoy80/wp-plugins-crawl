Teachers may create courses, lessons, and quizzes and is integrated with BBpress. The teacher may upload PDF\u2019s and podcasts as well to help get the lesson to users. When a user reads a lesson, views a course, or takes a quiz, WP-Tincan will automatically send a Tincan statement to the teacher saying which user did what. Using WP-Tincan will hopefully help the teacher understand what the user taking their course needs by letting the teacher know exactly what the user is doing.<\/p>\n<h3>SPECIAL THANKS<\/h3>\n<p>Rakhitha Nimesh for his work on WordPress Multiple Choice Quizzes<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/wp.tutsplus.com\/author\/rakhithanimesh\/<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/wp.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/plugins\/integrating-multiple-choice-quizzes-in-wordpress-creating-the-frontend\/<\/p>\n<p>TinCanJS<br \/>\nCopyright 2012 Rustici Software<\/p>\n<p>This product includes software developed at<br \/>\nRustici Software (http:\/\/www.scorm.com\/).<br \/>\n(wp-tincan\/js\/build\/tincan.js)<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unzip wp-tincan.zip<\/li>\n<li>Upload the unzipped files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Register for a FREE or Premium Scorm Cloud LRS Access at https:\/\/cloud.scorm.com\/sc\/guest\/SignUpForm<br \/>\n( Upon Gaining Access, All Info Needed for Step 5 is at https:\/\/cloud.scorm.com\/sc\/user\/LRSView<\/li>\n<li>Configure your LRS ( Learning Record Store ) Settings using the WP-Tincan &gt; &#8220;Tincan LRS Settings&#8221; Dashboard Link in your WordPress Dashboard<\/li>\n<li>Configure Your Wp-Tincan Settings:<\/li>\n<li>Create a New Certificate and paste the following code inside of your Content Box ( Use &#8216;text&#8217; view NOT visual view )<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION<\/p>\n<h3>[site_name]<\/h3>\n<p><strong>HEREBY PRESENTS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[student]<\/p>\n<p>With This Certificate in Recognition of Successful Completion of <strong>[course]<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Awarded on [date]<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create Courses<\/li>\n<li>Create Quizzes by Adding Individual Quiz Questions ( Keep in mind, a custom field is added for question answer possibilities that need to be filled out ) and Assigning each question to its appropriate &#8220;Quiz&#8221; ( quiz_categories ) taxonomy.
