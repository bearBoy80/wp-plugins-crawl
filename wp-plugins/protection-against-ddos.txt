It utilizes a very simple idea: when a real user accesses the login page, the plugin sets a validation cookie for this user. After the user submitted the log in form, the plugin checks if the cookie is there and correct. If so, the user is allowed to log in. Otherwise the user gets bounced off. Since malicious bots attack the WordPress login page directly, they don&#8217;t get the protection cookie and hence always get bounced off. Moreover validation happens at the server level BEFORE WordPress is even accessed (via .htaccess file) and hence no load is directed to the WordPress at all. The secure cookie is encrypted and unique for every site so the bots can&#8217;t falsify it. Simple and effective!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can it protect against any DDoS attack?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin protects against DDoS CAUSED by brute-force attacks ONLY. This is the most common cause for an operational WordPress site to be down though. If your site is under attack for other reasons (for example if you got a lot of traffic to one of your posts) this plugin will not help!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What are the system requirements?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin only works on the servers that support .htaccess files. Most Linux servers do.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.5.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added access control for autodiscover\/autodiscover.xml and wpad.dat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Can deny access to xmlrpc, RSS and certain countries now.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Multisite compatibility implemented.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Validation cookie is set via JavaScript now and encrypted.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Redirect POST-requests only for login page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Set validation cookie for all GET-requests.<\/li>\n<li>Use random cookie name for better security.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/protection-against-ddos\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2093105\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/protection-against-ddos\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2093105\" alt=\"Settings page.\"><\/a><p>Settings page.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">This is absolutely the best DDoS Protection plugin available<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/realact\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/dcd97894acb8f1d325ccac57b62cd612?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/dcd97894acb8f1d325ccac57b62cd612?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/realact\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Eli <small>(RealAct)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">April 24, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Our site was being attacked heavily using exactly the technics for which this plugin was creating for.
