It's fairly easy to set up and import your products into the Revcent account.  (you have to open one).  Once we imported the products from Woocommerce, we had to go into them in Revcent and set the appropriate ones up, on their subscription basis.    This took about a half hour for us, as we were just learning.   Now, it would take me just a few minutes.\n\nAfter finishing setup, I don't even have to go into my woocommerce site any more.   We can manage everything for each order (even non subscription ones) right within RevCent, and it sends all updates and notes and tracking updates back to Woocommerce. \n\nI also like how Revcent double verifies the PayPal transactions after they come in, and can even detect disputes.  It's pretty good.    I'm very happy I tried it, and the price is very fair. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">a nice upgrade<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/consumerhair\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f6b006e291af1552609da7588a813b0e?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f6b006e291af1552609da7588a813b0e?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/consumerhair\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">consumerhair<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 20, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Setting it up was easy, but I did get help from the people at Revcent who walked me through the configuration process.   Once done, which took about a half hour, I haven't needed any help.\n\nThe plugin itself is simple.  You basically set up your gateway in Revcent, and then just set Revcent as your gateway in Woocommece.   All the settings you make in your revcent account take over after that.    You manage the subscriptions in revcent, and the shipping, and refunds, etc.   Any changes you make in Revcent automatically sync the matching order in Woo.   \n\nI just found out I can add my other woocommerce store to the same revcent account, and manage both from the same place, which is a cool benefit.\n\nAs far as the subscription billing goes, it works really well.  You can do WAY more things to prevent cancellations with difficult customers.   \n\nAnyway, that's my two cents.   I do like this plugin very much and am now relying on it.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Extremely helpful<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/consumerskin\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7c1090e458f311e024c8edf48e1de0e3?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7c1090e458f311e024c8edf48e1de0e3?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/consumerskin\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">consumerskin<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 19, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">It works, first and foremost.

I tried another plugin for this, but the options for modifying subscriptions in order to save customers were just non existent.  \n\nWith this plugin, your Woocommerce store connects to their system, RevCent.  You have to have an account with them, which only took a minute to open.   Then, you manage all your sales and subscriptions and card processors, etc. from within the account.   If you update a sale\/order, it posts back to your Wordpress\/Woocommerce site, so everything stays in sync.\n\nOn the products I set to be \"subscription\" I can do a bunch of stuff I couldn't do before.   I can modify the price going forward, I can modify the number of days between billings, I can offer one time discounts to upcoming charges, I can change the product in the subscription (like for upgrade\/downgrade), and some other features I haven't gotten into yet.\n\nIt works perfectly so far.   It does take a little time to get your account in RevCent all set up for your offers, but it's easy once you get the hang of it.  They have live chat to help, which I needed the firs time.    Now that I'm set up though, it's simple. \n\nOne last feature that's great for me, is that they have a thing called \"decline salvage\" which is a set of rules you create to RE-try recurring charges that got declined.  You can re-try them at a discount too, and on an automated schedule if you want.   I have saved a few subscriptions with this feature, that I would have had to cancel otherwise.\n\nOverall, I'll give this plugin 5 stars.  But the plugin is really just a connection between your site and RevCent.   All the features and stuff you use are within the revcent account.
