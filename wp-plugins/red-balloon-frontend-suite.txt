See Frequently Asked Questions for more information.<\/p>\n<p>** Vertical Equaliser **<\/p>\n<p>Equalises the height of elements on the page. For example, you have 3 columns and you want the title of each to be the same height regardless of its length, so the columns display evenly.<\/p>\n<p>Add the class &#8216;rbveq&#8217; and &#8216;rbveq&#8211;groupname&#8217; to the elements you want to be the same height, where groupname is a unique identifier for that group. So your three titles might look like this:<\/p>\n<h3>Foo Bar<\/h3>\n<p>All those elements will now have the same height<\/p>\n<p>By default, elements will not be equalised below 768px, but you can customise the breakpoint by adding the class rbveq-breakpoint&#8211;xx to any one of the elements in the group, where xx is the breakpoint below which you do not want the elements to be height-equalised.<\/p>\n<p>** Autotype **<\/p>\n<p>Autotype makes text appear to type itself out once it scrolls into view. Use only on text elements, by adding the class &#8216;rb-autotype&#8217; and a unique ID.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you want a paragraph element to autotype when it scrolls into view you would use:<\/p>\n<p>Lorem Ipsum<\/p>\n<p>** Drop Cap **<\/p>\n<p>Turns the first letter of a paragraph into a drop cap. Simply add the class &#8220;rb-dropcap&#8221; to the text element. So if you want a paragraph element to start with a dropcap:<\/p>\n<p>Lorem Ipsum<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>\nCan I use these tools with Gutenberg editor?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use Autotype and Drop Cap. Click on &#8220;edit as HTML&#8221; for any text element and add the classes\/id as necessary.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nCan I use these tools with my visual builder plugin (DIVI, Elementor, etc)\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are able to add classes and IDs to elements then yes. More instructions for individual builders are coming soon. In the meantime please contact me if you need support.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nCan I get support?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Email me at chris@redballoonweb.com and I will help you implement the plugin on your website.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/red-balloon-frontend-suite.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"align":"align","dropcap":"dropcap","effects":"effects","type":"type"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
