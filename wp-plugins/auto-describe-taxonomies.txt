Having added some sanity checks and a missing array expansion, the plugin now works.

So this is version 1.0.4.<br \/>\n*If you have Dan Frateans Auto Describe Tags, I suggest uninstalling it prior to installing Auto Describe Taxonomies as it will do the same thing and there is no sense in having two describing engines running on your installation.<\/p>\n<h3>TODO<\/h3>\n<p>*automatic language conversions of described taxonomies Status: researching &#8230;<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin zip archive.<\/li>\n<li>Extract it in your &#8216;wp-content\/plugins&#8217; folder or upload via admin panel.<\/li>\n<li>Browse to your plugins section and activate the plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>OR &#8211;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Install it via the plugin manager.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Why did you do this?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Dan Fratean was working on an upgrade that broke and he dropped off the face of the Earth.
