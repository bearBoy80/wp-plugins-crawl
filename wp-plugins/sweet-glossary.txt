When you activate the plugin, it creates a Custom Post Type called \\&#8221;glossary\\&#8221;. From there you can add all the terms you want to the glossary, as simple as creating a new post.<\/p>\n<p>And then what? Just use the shortcode \\&#8221;[sweetglossary]\\&#8221; to display the list of terms you have created in your glossary.<\/p>\n<p>The shortcode displays a sweet table with all the terms created in the glossary in alphabetical order and with a link to each of the terms to improve the SEO of your site.<\/p>\n<p>It also inserts a search box to filter all the terms dynamically.<\/p>\n<p>Add the shortcode wherever you want. The recommended way is to insert it in a page, with an SEO optimized title and add an introduction before adding the shortcode.<\/p>\n<p>And that\\&#8217;s it!
