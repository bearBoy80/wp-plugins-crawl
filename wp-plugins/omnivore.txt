And the list of supported platforms keeps growing.  The support team and the overall management are wonderfully responsive, caring, and professional. And they are pro-active. Linking a high throughput Woocommerce site to multiple platforms is not an easy feat - but this plug-in in concert with their excellent support Gurus make the whole process fast and effective.  Simply Highly Recommended as Omnivore lets us extend our reach into various markets unlike anything else.  Kudos to the Team!!!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/omnivore.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"omnivore":"omnivore","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/omnivore\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=1968699","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/omnivore\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=1968699"}}
