Supported patterns are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Hourly &#8211; every 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 or 12 hours starting from a given time<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Daily &#8211; every day at a given time<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Weekly &#8211; every week on chosen week days (more than one day can be selected) at a given time<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Monthly &#8211; every month on a given date at a given time<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Monthly by week day &#8211; every month on a given week and day (e.g. first monday, last saturday, second friday, etc.)<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Yearly &#8211; every year on a given month and date at a given time<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Other features<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When configuring Smart Countdown FX or adding a shortcode to you post you can choose one of or both recirrence patterns defined in &#8220;Smart Countdown FX Easy Recurring Events&#8221; configuration. The opition to use both patterns will merge events from each recurrence into a single timeline. Of course you can merge any kind of patterns but mostly this feature serves for creating different schedules for week days and weekends in a combined &#8220;Weekly&#8221; pattern.<\/p>\n<p>All events in a recurrence pattern have the same duration which can be set in &#8220;Duration&#8221; option in plugin configuration. When recurring events are imported the widget will show countdown to the next scheduled event and after event starts it will show &#8220;In progress&#8221; (or whatever title you set for &#8220;count up&#8221; mode) while event is in progress (i.e. during the interval set as &#8220;Duration&#8221;). After that the counter will automatically start countdown to the next event.<\/p>\n<p>Overlapping events are also supported.<\/p>\n<p>For samples and complete list of features <a href=\"http:\/\/wp.smartcalc.org\/recurring-events\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">see this page<\/a><\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content\/plugins\/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
