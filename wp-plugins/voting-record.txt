Elected officials can record and display their votes and citizens can track and display the votes of an elected official they follow.<\/p>\n<p>Votes are entered on a dashboard widget. A vote management page is available from the posts menu. Recent votes are shown by adding <code>&lt;?php recent_votes(); ?&gt;<\/code> in your theme templates or <code>[RECENT-VOTES]<\/code> within a text widget. You can show a search votes form by using the shortcode <code>[SEARCH-VOTES]<\/code> on a page or post. Options for Voting Record include:<\/p>\n<p>Options Include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The option to specify a primary voter (if most or all of the votes being tracked are from one person).<\/li>\n<li>How many recent votes to show &#8211; limited by number of votes or number of days. This includes a &#8220;Days plus&#8221; option which displays the specified number of days plus any extra votes to reach a minimum list size specified by the user (defaults to 5).<\/li>\n<li>Output for the recent votes and the search results are specified by templates. Each template contains a variable to specify what should precede the list, a variable to specify what should follow the list, a variable to show what should display if there are no results, and a template of how the list items should be formatted. List items allow the use of the following template tags &#8211; {bill} to display the name of the bill, {vote} to display the vote cast, {voter} displays the name of the voter, {date} displays the date the vote was cast, {desc} displays the description, {result} displays the overall pass\/fail outcome of the vote, {tally} displays the overall vote tally. In addition to those standard tags, the header and footer for the search results can use the {count} tamplate tag to display a count of the results from the current search.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<p>To install it simply unzip the file linked above and save it in your plugins directory under wp-content.
