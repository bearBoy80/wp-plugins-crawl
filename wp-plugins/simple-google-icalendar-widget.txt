Build and tested with Iana timezones as used in php, Google, and Apple now also tested with Microsoft timezones and unknown timezones. For unknown timezone-names using the default timezone of WordPress (probably the local timezone).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Recurrent events, Timezone,  Daylight Saving Time<\/h3>\n<p>Most users don&#8217;t worry about time zones. The timezonesettings for the WordPress installation, the calendar application and the events are all the same local time.<br \/>\nIn that case this widget displays all the recurrent events with the same local times. The widget uses the properties of the starttime and duration (in seconds) of the first event to calculate the repeated events. Only when a calculated time is removed during the transition from ST (standard time, wintertime) to DST (daylight saving time, summertime) by turning the clock forward one hour, both the times of the event (in case the starttime is in the transition period) or only the endtime (in case only the endtime is in the transition period)  of the event are pushed forward with that same amount.<br \/>\nBut because the transition period is usually very early in the morning, few events will be affected by it.<br \/>\nIf a calculated day does not exist (i.e. February 30), the event will not be displayed. (Formally this should also happen to the time in the transition from ST to DST)<\/p>\n<p>For users in countries that span more time zones, or users with international events the calendar applications can add a timezone to the event times. So users in other timezones will see the event in the local time in there timezone (as set in timezone settings of WordPress) corresponding with the time.<br \/>\nThe widget uses the starttime, the timezone of the starttime and the duration in seconds of the starting event as starting point for the calculation of repeating events. So if the events startime timezone does&#8217;not use daylight savings time and and timezone of the widget (i.e. the WP timezone setting) does. During DST the events are placed an hour later than during ST. (more precisely shift with the local time shift). Similar the events will be shift earlier when the timezone of the starttime has DST and the timezone of the widget not.<\/p>\n<p>Of course the same effect is achieved when you schedule the events in UTC time despite using local time DST in your standard calendar.<br \/>\nIn these cases, a special effect can be seen of using the same times twice in the transition from DST to ST. If an event lasts less than an hour. If the event starts in the last hour of DST then it ends in the first hour of ST in between the local clocks are turned back one hour. According to the local clock, the end time is therefore before the start time. And the widget shows it like this too. The same also applies to Google and Outlook calendar.<br \/>\nTheoretically this could als happen with recurrent events in the same timezone with DST. In my test I have seen this with Google calendar but not with the widget. PHP and therefore the widget uses the second occurence if the result of the calculation is a time that is twice available (at least in the version of PHP I use), but using the first occurence like Google does is just as good.<\/p>\n<p>Test results and comparison with Google and Outlook calendar have been uploaded as DayLightSavingTime test.xlsx.<\/p>\n<h3>From the ical specifications<\/h3>\n<pre><code>see http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/rfc\/rfc5545.txt for specification of te ical format.\n(see 3.3.10.

Thus probably most calendars will only give the plain text in the Description in the iCal output.<br \/>\nSecondly: For security reasons  this plugin filters the HTML to convert characters that have special significance in HTML to the corresponding HTML-entities.<\/p>\n<p>But if you trust the output of the calendar application you can set a checkbox to allow safe html in the output. So if you manage to get the HTML in the Description and you set the checkbox to allow safe html you can get that html in the output, with exception of the tags that are not considered safe like SCRIPT and unknown tags.<br \/>\nAnd with the current version  of Google Calendar you can put some HTML in the Description output. (April 2022) I saw the  &lt;a&gt; (link),  &lt;b&gt; (bold text),  &lt;i&gt; (italic text),  &lt;u&gt; (underlined text) and  &lt;br&gt; (linebreak) tags in a iCal description. They will all come through with &#8220;Allow safe html&#8221; checkbox on. Probably even more is possible, but Google can also decide to comply more to the standard.<br \/>\nWith Microsoft Outlook the HTML tags were filtered away and did not reach the iCal description<\/p>\n<p>In case you have all kinds of HTML in your appointments a plugin that uses the API of te calendar-application might be a better choice for you.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20use%20microsoft%20office%20outlook%20calendar%3F'>\nHow to use Microsoft Office Outlook Calendar?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>First you have to share your calendar to make it public available, or to create and share a public calendar.

Test code deleted. Present as RC to wordpress.<\/li>\n<li>0.2.0 starting work on repeating events <\/li>\n<li>0.1.0 Added support for start and end time with timezone<br \/>\n    Changed lay-out of output of teh widget so that is more in line with bootstrap 4 and with the iframe-widget of google<br \/>\n    a lot of small changes eg: better support for events in a timezone and events that last a whole day.
