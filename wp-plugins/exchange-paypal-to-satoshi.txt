That&#8217;s it.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nCan I sell satoshi to customers who uses not USD, but Euro or Roubles ?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, PayPal will do the conversion for any supported currency.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nWho pays the Bitcoin commission ?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nobody does. The crypto-currency transaction happens via micro-payment system, so it is free. By the way &#8211; it is also instant.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nIs it profitable ?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well, at least it is not unprofitable &#8211; the plugin checks the official exchange rate and reacts accordingly.<br \/>\nHowever when you set your exchange rates you have to consider PayPal commission on transactions and on currency exchange (if applicable).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nHow profitable it is?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is always &#8220;supply and demand&#8221;, so we can&#8217;t say.<br \/>\nWe only provide ability to sell satoshi for fiat currency at your own rates, the rest is up to you.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, PayPal will do the conversion for any supported currency.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nWhat if I sell more satoshi than I have?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is highly unlikely, but possible. It may happen if more than one person buys the rest of your satoshi simultaneously.<br \/>\nIn this case you have to contact the customer and settle the issue by refunding the fiat, or by sending satoshi by other means.<br \/>\nTherefore do not switch too many notifications off, so you will be informed and react in-time.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>V1.0.4 &#8211; 15.07.2020<\/h4>\n<p>Names of call-back were changed to avoid possible collisions.<\/p>\n<h4>V1.0.3 &#8211; 13.07.2020<\/h4>\n<p>Fixed the blank page happening if user did not configure the plugin.<\/p>\n<h4>V1.0.2 &#8211; 13.07.2020<\/h4>\n<p>Fixed ugly JavaScript timing error.<\/p>\n<h4>V1.0.1 &#8211; 12.07.2020<\/h4>\n<p>Bootstrap compatibility fixed.<\/p>\n<h4>V1.0.0 &#8211; 12.07.2020<\/h4>\n<p>Initial public release.<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2377820\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2377820\" alt=\"&lt;strong&gt;Exchange From&lt;\/strong&gt; - Front-end\"><\/a><p><strong>Exchange From<\/strong> - Front-end<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2377820\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2377820\" alt=\"&lt;strong&gt;Crypto-currency settings&lt;\/strong&gt; - Admin interface\"><\/a><p><strong>Crypto-currency settings<\/strong> - Admin interface<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2377820\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2377820\" alt=\"&lt;strong&gt;PayPal and Exchange settings&lt;\/strong&gt;  - Admin interface\"><\/a><p><strong>PayPal and Exchange settings<\/strong>  - Admin interface<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2377820\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2377820\" alt=\"&lt;strong&gt;Notification ans Front-end settings&lt;\/strong&gt;  - Admin interface\"><\/a><p><strong>Notification ans Front-end settings<\/strong>  - Admin interface<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2377820","caption":"<strong>Exchange From<\/strong> - Front-end"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2377820","caption":"<strong>Crypto-currency settings<\/strong> - Admin interface"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2377820","caption":"<strong>PayPal and Exchange settings<\/strong>  - Admin interface"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2377820","caption":"<strong>Notification ans Front-end settings<\/strong>  - Admin interface"}},"tags":{"bitcoin":"bitcoin","currency":"currency","exchange":"exchange","paypal":"paypal","satoshi":"satoshi"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.donationalerts.com\/r\/svinuga","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/exchange-paypal-to-satoshi\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2339271","high":false}}
