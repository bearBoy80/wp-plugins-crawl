No one controls it. Bitcoins aren\u2019t printed, like dollars or euros \u2013 they\u2019re produced by people, and increasingly businesses, running computers all around the world, using software that solves mathematical problems.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why bitcoin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It\u2019s cheap<\/p>\n<p>With credit card transactions, your merchant account bills you on a per-transaction basis. Some merchant accounts will charge a fee for debit card transactions, as you have to pay a \u2018swipe fee\u2019. Bitcoin transaction fees are minimal, or in some cases free.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s as private as you want it to be<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, we don\u2019t want people knowing what we have purchased. Bitcoin is a relatively private currency. On the one hand, it is transparent \u2013 thanks to the blockchain, everyone knows how much a particular bitcoin address holds in transactions. They know where those transactions came from, and where they\u2019re sent. On the other hand, unlike conventional bank accounts, no one knows who holds a particular bitcoin address.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to trust anyone else<\/p>\n<p>In a conventional banking system, you have to trust people to handle your money properly along the way. You have to trust the bank, for example. You might have to trust a third-party payment processor. You\u2019ll often have to trust the merchant too.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/information\/why-use-bitcoin\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More on why bitcion is an important payment layer here<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why adblockers?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are in a macro environment in which publishers are openly wondering where their revenues are going to come from in 20 years.  On a micro scale, there has been a lot of ink (and bits) spilled about the resounding need for change in the ad and publishing space <em>today<\/em>.  Some analysis\u2019 have shown that 9.26% of impressions were found to be ad-blocked, with some sites reaching as high as 50%  While there is innovation happening in online payments, no one has yet connected the dots in a meaningful way.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why Block Ads to Bitcoin<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Block Ads to Bitcoin is a free and easy way to monetize ad space that is unused due to adblockers.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How much can I expect to monetize with Block Ads to Bitcoin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen CPMs of over $2.00.
