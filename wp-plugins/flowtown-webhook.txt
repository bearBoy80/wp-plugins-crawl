There should be no problem with Intense Debate since it syncs comments in real time with your blog&#8217;s database. Disqus will only sync comments with your blog&#8217;s database when requested, but once the sync has been requested, the blog commenters will be added.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added better parsing for email to accommodate for &#8220;.&#8221; and &#8220;+&#8221; characters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added ability to only send approved commenters to Flowtown (spam commenters will always be filtered out).
