WP Roster comes with a fully-fledged application interface and is designed to take up the whole window of your site &#8211; the plugin comes with a custom page template to make this easily achievable so you can still maintain the existing look on your other pages. However, for most use cases, and what I recommend, is using the plugin on a barebones WordPress install on a subdomain. The plugin has been tested with the free Twenty Sixteen theme so for best results it is recommended to use this theme as otherwise additional CSS work may be required.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/northernbeacheswebsites.com.au\/wp-roster\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Check out WP Roster in action (pro version)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>WP Roster has been designed specifically for church service rostering however the plugin can be used for a wide range of team and event applications. Maybe if you run an event company this could be handy or perhaps you have a team or business that has daily\/weekly\/monthly tasks or roles.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin takes a table approach to presenting data as oppose to the more traditional calendar interface. This might not work for you but for certain contexts where each event has a bit going on this table view makes a lot more sense. With WP Roster you can create multiple dates, teams, members and lists and then on your main roster page allocate members to dates and teams with ease.<\/p>\n<p>For churches and other organisations, WP Roster creates a great middle-ground option which sits between having a full-blown CRM system which can be clunky and can require a lot of resources to maintain &#8211; and not to mention typically high ongoing fees and not having true ownership of your data; and DIY Excel spreadsheets which are hard to share, don&#8217;t look and work too great and aren&#8217;t the best solution to organise teams and events. Although WP Roster isn&#8217;t a full CRM system, it does use the built-in WordPress user system so you could extend the plugin however you want to! For example, it would be very easy to install a WordPress MailChimp user sync plugin to add all your members to MailChimp for ongoing emails etc.<\/p>\n<p>Every aspect of the plugin has been meticulously designed to present a truly beautiful and simple frontend and backend interface which is mobile friendly.<\/p>\n<p>Creating and deploying rosters is incredibly fast and easy. The plugin also comes with a setting restoration page so if you make a mistake you can easily roll back changes. The plugin has been made translation friendly except for popups &#8211; which I will make translatable based on demand.<\/p>\n<h4>Upgrade to pro<\/h4>\n<p>WP Roster is great but it is very limited compared to WP Roster Pro &#8211; in many respects this free version should be considered as a taster for those that need a really great roster system. WP Roster Pro comes with the following features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to create multiple rosters<\/li>\n<li>Ability to send conditional and dynamic automated notifications including SMS and email notifications (SMS charges are not included)<\/li>\n<li>Ability to upload members from a CSV file<\/li>\n<li>Add multiple dates with a click of a button<\/li>\n<li>Unavailable rows so users can add in their unavailability for those creating the roster with roster clash highlighting<\/li>\n<li>A dynamic run sheet template for each roster<\/li>\n<li>Take attendance of groups and rosters\/services<\/li>\n<li>Custom member fields<\/li>\n<li>Super awesome support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For most teams and organisations these are must-have features so <a href=\"https:\/\/northernbeacheswebsites.com.au\/wp-roster-pro\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">upgrade to pro today<\/a><\/p>\n","installation":"<p>There are a few options for installing and setting up this plugin.<\/p>\n<h4>Upload Manually<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and unzip the plugin<\/li>\n<li>Upload the &#8216;wp-roster&#8217; folder into the &#8216;\/wp-content\/plugins\/&#8217; directory<\/li>\n<li>Go to the Plugins admin page and activate the plugin<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Install via the Admin Area<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>In the admin area go to Plugins &gt; Add New and search for &#8220;WP Roster&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Click install and then click activate<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"<p>Please check out the Support tab in the plugin settings for FAQ&#8217;s<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>2.30<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility Update<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.29<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.28<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing of fatal error when bad shortcode used<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.27<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.26<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Force plugin updates <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.25<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows HTML in email content field<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.24<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updates for Sinch<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.23<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updates for Sinch<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.22<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updates for Sinch<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.21<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing of issue with WordPress hijacking query string &#8220;page&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.20<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with settings not saving for free users<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.19<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed date translation issue for notifications<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.18<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed date translation issue for run sheet download<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.17<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.16<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Made dates show based on WordPress language<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.15<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with clipboard functionality in WordPress 5.2<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.14<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with custom field setting not showing when first setting up the plugin<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.13<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Unavailable people listing now sorted alphabetically<\/li>\n<li>You can now set in roster settings the amount of unavailable rows<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.12<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with apostrophes in text items <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.11<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with apostrophes in list items <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.10<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with logo not working in menu<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Now you can upload a file to the roster<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove backslashes from a range of areas from the plugin<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Small bug fixes to user update procedure<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Small bug fixes to user update procedure<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Now supports segmentation statistics for attendance in the pro version! <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Now supports custom member fields for the pro version! <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Very minor fixes to the descriptions on the team tab to make things more clear<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor bug fixes around permissions and more reliable charting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Attendance now has line graphs and notices of attendances<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New pro feature, now collect attendance for notification groups and rosters!
