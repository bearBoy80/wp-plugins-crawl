The mini-extension leverages <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/composite-products\/composite-products-advanced-configuration\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Scenarios<\/a> to conditionally layer additional images over the main Composite Product image.<\/p>\n<h3>Documentation<\/h3>\n<p>The plugin introduces a new &#8220;Overlay Image&#8221; Scenario Action that lets you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose an image from your Media library.<\/li>\n<li>Define <strong>conditions<\/strong> for layering this image over the main Composite Product image.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This approach makes it possible to utilize either <strong>swapping<\/strong> or <strong>compositing<\/strong> techniques to conditionally modify the main product image.<\/p>\n<p>For more information and examples, check out the plugin&#8217;s repository on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/somewherewarm\/woocommerce-composite-products-conditional-images\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Important<\/strong>: The code in this plugin is provided &#8220;as is&#8221;. Support via the WordPress.org forum is provided on a <strong>voluntary<\/strong> basis only. If you have an active subscription for WooCommerce Composite Products, please be aware that WooCommerce Support may not be able to assist you with this experimental plugin.<\/p>\n<h4>Image Swapping<\/h4>\n<p>If you have previously worked with Variable Products and Variation Images, chances are you are already familiar with this technique. Here&#8217;s the idea behind image swapping:<\/p>\n<p>The main product image is <strong>swapped<\/strong> with an image that depicts the chosen options as soon as the configuration of the Composite Product is complete.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of replacing the product images, the same effect can be achieved by covering the main product image with a fully opaque (non-transparent) image.<\/p>\n<h4>Image Compositing<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Compositing<\/strong> is the combination of multiple layers of images into a single image. The final composition creates the illusion that all stacked images are parts of the same scene. For this technique to work, each layered image must include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>some <strong>transparent<\/strong> areas that allow lower layers of the stack to be seen;<\/li>\n<li>some <strong>opaque<\/strong> areas that introduce new elements in the scene by covering the layers below; and<\/li>\n<li>possibly, some <strong>semi-trasparent<\/strong> areas that introduce new elements while partially allowing the layers below to be seen.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: When multiple <strong>Overlay Image<\/strong> Scenarios exist, each adds its own image to the main product image stack. The layering order of these conditional images depends on the relative position of their Scenarios: If Scenario A is positioned higher than Scenario B under <strong>Product Data &gt; Scenarios<\/strong>, then the image added by Scenario A will appear higher in the stack than the image added by Scenario B.<\/p>\n<h4>Swapping vs Compositing<\/h4>\n<p>The <strong>Swapping<\/strong> technique is a viable choice if the number of Component Options is relatively low, as it requires you to <strong>capture one picture<\/strong> and <strong>create one Scenario<\/strong> for every possible configuration. Its main advantage over the <strong>Compositing<\/strong> technique is that it allows you to obtain a natural-looking result, even if you don&#8217;t have advanced image processing skills.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Compositing<\/strong> technique is often a better choice if the number of possible configurations is high, as it requires you to create one &#8220;compositable&#8221; image for each Component Option. However, specialized knowledge and tools are required to produce a natural-looking result. For this reason, the Compositing technique is often preferred when 3D product models are available, as 3D modelling software can speed up the production of &#8220;compositable&#8221; images.<\/p>\n<h4>Limitations<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>The product image cannot be opened in a lightbox once the mini-extension has stacked additional images over it.<\/li>\n<li>The image zooming feature included with WooCommerce is not compatible with the swapping\/compositing techniques introduced by the mini-extension. When a Composite Product includes Scenarios with the <strong>Overlay Image<\/strong> Scenario Action, the image zooming feature of the Composite Product is disabled.<\/li>\n<li>The plugin works with themes that declare support for the <code>wc-product-gallery-slider<\/code> feature.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","installation":"<p>Composite Products &#8211; Conditional Images:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Requires the official <a href=\"https:\/\/woocommerce.com\/products\/composite-products\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Composite Products<\/a> extension.
