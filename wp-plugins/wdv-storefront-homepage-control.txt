Will the plugin work now?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It may or may not work, depeding on the level of changes you have made. The plugin is supposed to work only on unchanged default home page template of Storefront Theme.<br \/>\nIt may work in case you have made only cosmetic changes, like changing colors and fonts, and may stop working if you have added hooks or filters to the theme.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<p>NA<\/p>\n","description":"<p>This plugin allows Woocommerce Storefront Theme users to control display of selected blocks and categories on default Storefront homepage template.<\/p>\n<p>Update: Note that Woocommerce version 4.7.0 and higher does not use the <code>Homepage<\/code> template by default (tested with storefront theme version 2.5.3). Instead the homepage is created with separte shortcode functions, giving the users a better way to manage the homepage.  But this plugin will still work, just make sure that the template used for the home page is <code>Homepage<\/code> template of storefront theme and not any other page template.<\/p>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Works very well for our needs.<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jeffwebsites\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/56d1d083189abf89c8f245e37a1d3611?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/56d1d083189abf89c8f245e37a1d3611?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jeffwebsites\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">jeffwebsites<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 15, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">After changing over to the Woocommerce StoreFront theme, the Home page had many added sections that we did not want on that page. \nThis plugin worked perfectly after loading it, I was able to just check the boxes and block all of the unwanted sections.\nSome minor tweaks are needed, but they do not affect the functionality or utility of this:\nIf we show the Products block, it only displays a few things, so that should be controllable to display more.\nTied to that, the plugin shows all of the products on the site and then you have to select each item individually if you want them on your Home page. There should be a \"Select all\" box at the top so if you want them all you don;t have to go through tens or hundreds of items.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wdv-storefront-homepage-control.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"storefront":"storefront","storefront-homepage":"storefront homepage","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"https:\/\/webdesignvista.com\/wdv_wordpress_plugin\/storefront-homepage-control-plugin\/","banners":[]}
