BuddyPress is a suite of components that are common to a typical social network, and allows for great add-on features through WordPress&#8217;s extensive plugin system.<\/p>\n<p>Aimed at site builders &amp; developers, BuddyPress is focused on ease of integration, ease of use, and extensibility. It is deliberately powerful yet unbelievably simple social network software, built by contributors to WordPress.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"VideoPress Video Player\" aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/video.wordpress.com\/embed\/wvvZgNwo?hd=1&amp;cover=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen allow='clipboard-write'><\/iframe><script src='https:\/\/v0.wordpress.com\/js\/next\/videopress-iframe.js?m=1674852142'><\/script><\/p>\n<p>Members can register on your site to create user profiles, have private conversations, make social connections, create and interact in groups, and much more. Truly a social network in a box, BuddyPress helps you build a home for your company, school, sports team, or other niche community.<\/p>\n<h4>Built with developers in mind<\/h4>\n<p>BuddyPress helps site builders &amp; developers add community features to their websites. It comes with a robust theme compatibility API that does its best to make every BuddyPress content page look and feel right with just about any WordPress theme. You will likely need to adjust some styling on your own to make everything look pristine.<\/p>\n<p>BuddyPress themes are just WordPress themes with additional templates, and with a little work, you could easily create your own, too! A handful of BuddyPress-specific themes are readily available for download from WordPress.org, and lots more are available from third-party theme authors.<\/p>\n<p>BuddyPress also comes with built-in support for Akismet and <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/bbpress\/\" rel=\"ugc\">bbPress<\/a>, two very popular and very powerful WordPress plugins. If you&#8217;re using either, visit their settings pages and ensure everything is configured to your liking.<\/p>\n<h4>The BuddyPress Add-ons<\/h4>\n<p>WordPress.org is home to some amazing Add-ons for BuddyPress, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/bp-attachments\/\" rel=\"ugc\">BP Attachments<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/bp-classic\/\" rel=\"ugc\">BP Classic<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>NB<\/strong>: BP Classic is a backwards compatibility Add-on for BuddyPress 12.0 and up bringing back the BP Legacy URL parser, the BP Default theme and BP Legacy widgets.<\/p>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/buddypress\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BuddyPress profile on WordPress.org<\/a> to find them all!<\/p>\n<h4>Join our community<\/h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in contributing to BuddyPress, we&#8217;d love to have you. Head over to the <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.buddypress.org\/participate-and-contribute\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BuddyPress Documentation<\/a> site to find out how you can pitch in.<\/p>\n<p>BuddyPress is available in many languages thanks to the volunteer efforts of individuals all around the world. Check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.buddypress.org\/translations\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">translations page<\/a> on the BuddyPress Documentation site for more details. If you are a polyglot, please <a href=\"https:\/\/translate.wordpress.org\/projects\/wp-plugins\/buddypress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">consider helping translate BuddyPress<\/a> into your language.<\/p>\n<p>Growing the BuddyPress community means better software for everyone!<\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>Requirements<\/h4>\n<p>To run BuddyPress, we recommend your host supports:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP version 7.4 or greater.<\/li>\n<li>MySQL version 5.7 or greater OR MariaDB version 10.4 or greater.<\/li>\n<li>HTTPS support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note: If you are in a legacy environment where you only have older PHP or MySQL versions, WordPress also works with PHP 5.6.20+ and MySQL 5.0+, but these versions have reached official End Of Life and as such may expose your site to security vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n<h4>Automatic installation<\/h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles everything itself. To do an automatic install of BuddyPress, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.<\/p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;BuddyPress&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you&#8217;ve found it, you can view details about the latest release, such as community reviews, ratings, and description. Install BuddyPress by simply pressing &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Once activated:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit &#8216;Settings &gt; BuddyPress &gt; Components&#8217; and adjust the active components to match your community (you can always toggle these later).<\/li>\n<li>Visit &#8216;Settings &gt; BuddyPress &gt; Pages&#8217; and setup your directories and special pages. We create a few automatically, but suggest you customize these to fit the flow and verbiage of your site.<\/li>\n<li>Visit &#8216;Settings &gt; BuddyPress &gt; Settings&#8217; and take a moment to match BuddyPress&#8217;s settings to your expectations. We pick the most common configuration by default, but every community is different.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20my%20existing%20wordpress%20theme%3F'>\nCan I use my existing WordPress theme?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!

It is good BuddyPress allows you precisely to turn what functionality what want on and turn everything else off. For my case I just wanted the ability to allow BuddyPress groups to have their own associated bbPress forum. It worked, although the default themes are rather plain - hence my desire for a good theme recommendation. BuddyPress and bbPress work well together. My only issue is one common to all Wordpress users. The more plugins you add to a Wordpress site, the greater the chances of some little issues occurring, although this is not the fault of BuddyPress or bbPress.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I was looking for what forum plug-in to use, I installed three different ones. bbPress was the most plain looking one by default.

The core functions are below average, the standard design of the plugin is awful, looks like a plugin built in the mid 2000s like the designs we used to see in 2006\/2007. The plugin is very primitive, there are no reshare options for status, no likes for post but a weird star that doesn't even gets notified to another user. Then why the hell the plugin doesn't support medias by default? You need toooo many plugin just to add some small simple things that should be inside the plugin by default, like also live notifications. I've been using Buddypress for years and my conclusion is that this plugin has been built only to make you pay for everything and make everything super complex, this plugin is not really customer friendly and it's not a nice choice to create a social network based platform, and if you want a decent social network prepare yourself to install 40+ plugins only for buddypress.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Blank registration page, profile page in classic themes with theme.json file<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"4 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"4\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/exstheme\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1823b8571e6996048b616b6602b21358?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1823b8571e6996048b616b6602b21358?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/exstheme\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">exstheme<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 31, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Plugin is great, our theme supports it.

I had high hopes for BuddyBoss, but the product doesn\u2019t live up to the hype. The one claim they make that they live up to is support, which is good.\n\nIf you want to build a site that\u2019s a straightforward clone of Facebook, with no unique functions or features, BuddyBoss might work well for you. \n\nBut if your members need functions beyond ordinary social media, you\u2019re probably better off with a plugin like Youzify that allows you to add these social media features to a regular WordPress site that allows you to do anything.\n\n<strong>Here are just a few of the major problems we encountered:<\/strong>\n1) They have a \"BuddyBoss Integrations\" webpage with a long list of plugins that supposedly are compatible with BuddyBoss, but I think they just mean your computer won\u2019t blow up if you combine them.  For instance,  Elementor is on that list, which was a major plus since we use it heavily. But it turns out that none of the core BuddyBoss pages (like Groups, Forums, Members, etc.) are editable in Elementor: you can only create new pages in Elementor using their Sample page.\n\n2) Don't believe their claim of requiring fewer plugins: you\u2019ll need tons of them. It\u2019s true that you don\u2019t need BuddyPress, but that\u2019s about it for cutting down on plugins.\n\n3) Many of our support requests got the reply that we would need to hire a professional developer to get what we want. Sometimes it seemed like sending business to developers was the reason they created BuddyBoss.\n\n4) The turning point came when we realized that we were spending half our development time trying to work around BuddyBoss limitations. We bought it to make our lives easier, not harder.\n\nWe were far beyond the 14-day money back guarantee. But, since we never used BuddyBoss for even one minute on a live site, I was hoping for at least a partial refund, since it turned out to be useless to us. (There\u2019s no way you can really discover that in just 14 days.) No such luck: $228 and six months of work wasted.\n\nI worry about the future of the BuddyBoss company.  They regularly have lifetime license offers that they push really hard. They are sacrificing future revenues for a cash infusion now, which makes me wonder whether they have staffed-up too fast and created too much overhead.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Friends need this<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/anonymized-13836360\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/4abc46daebb8b3cde35da435097d3431?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/4abc46daebb8b3cde35da435097d3431?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/anonymized-13836360\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Anonymous User 13836360 <small>(anonymized_13836360)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 13, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">\u9080\u8acb\u670b\u53cb\u4f86\u8a0e\u8ad6\u5340<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Requires too many plugins<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"3 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"3\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/akashicseer\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ebf8c2fae48bfdce679712d6d51c1f5d?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ebf8c2fae48bfdce679712d6d51c1f5d?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/akashicseer\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">akashicseer<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 31, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">First off I am a programmer and web developer. I thought I would try out buddypress with wordpress because I use wordpress for my blog. I am running buddypress locally on my pc with vagrant\/virtualbox ...\n\nBuddypress itself works fine. I was really excited at first. I thought Oh wow this is cool, I can use this. I was playing around and I went to create a post and noticed there was no way to add any sort of media or emoji's etc.  It seems like things are missing all over. So I got to reading the Buddypress doc, then I got to googling.\n\nIt turns out that in order to allow users to add media you need a plugin. rtMedia is what came up. Ok I'll add that. Try it out. Images upload everything else fails. Come to find out you need the transcoder for that. OK I think. I add that. WELLLL... Now you need to pay $9 a month. And if you want the pretty options of rtMedia you need to pay $499 a year. Ok what about reporting and mediating? More plugins. More money. \nWant to let users edit their posts??? YEAH ANOTHER PLUGIN and More money$$$\nWant to let users share ??? yeah you got it, another plugin. \n\nThis is as bad as the micro-transactions in games. Basically you will be plugin shopping just to create the basic feeling of a social platform. Being able to report content is very important.\n\nI mean it seems like everything is a damned plugin and who knows if all of these plugins will work together or with my theme or blah blah blah.\nI didn't go much further. Who knows how many more plugins I would need to get an actual usable social platform that someone would use up and running. \nThere are many other options out there that work great, look great and cost less. Media is one of the most important parts of a social platform, without that it is nothing but a boring giant comment website.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Best free plugin for social media<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/reymatog\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9f3a100e17a1c363353411d698ce0640?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9f3a100e17a1c363353411d698ce0640?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/reymatog\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">reymatog<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">June 3, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">It is somewat missing most of privacy tools for members tho:(<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/buddypress.12.0.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/buddypress\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1534012","caption":"<strong>Activity Streams<\/strong> - Global, personal, and group activity streams with threaded commenting, direct posting, favoriting and @mentions.
