When logging in with Credly Login, a new WordPress user account will automatically be generated and associated with the user&#8217;s Credly account for future logins.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin also comes with a sidebar widget that allows users to login on the front-end of your site with either their WordPress or Credly credentials.<\/p>\n<p>If a user already has a WordPress account on your site, the Credly Login plugin will look for a WordPress user that has the same email address associated with their Credly account. If one is found, the Credly account will then be used to log in with that existing user account.<\/p>\n<p>While this is a standalone plugin which will work on any WordPress site, it makes a great companion to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/badgeos\/\" title=\"BadgeOS\" rel=\"ugc\">BadgeOS<\/a>, which empowers you to issue achievements and badges for a wide range of activity on your site.<\/p>\n<p>Badges earned with BadgeOS can be sent automatically to <a href=\"https:\/\/credly.com\/\" title=\"Credly\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Credly<\/a> when earned, where recipients can manage and share them with other lifelong achievements.
