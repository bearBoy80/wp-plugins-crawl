The default timeout duration is 3600 seconds (1 hour), but you can adjust this on the Inactivity Logout Settings page.<\/p>\n<h3>Why should I use such a thing?<\/h3>\n<p>There may be many reasons to do so! For example, imagine you&#8217;re uploading a large file to your WordPress library. If you&#8217;re inactive for too long, you&#8217;ll be automatically logged out before the upload process finishes. This means you&#8217;ll have to start the entire process from the beginning again. However, by using this plugin, you&#8217;ll be able to extend the time session to whatever length you need.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Upload the entire staylogged folder to the wp-content\/plugins\/ directory.<br \/>\nActivate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.<br \/>\nGo to the Inactivity Logout Settings page under the Settings menu and adjust the logout time duration as desired.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<p>Initial release of StayLogged plugin.<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/staylogged\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2925921\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/staylogged\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2925921\" alt=\"\"><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/staylogged\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2925921\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/staylogged\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2925921\" alt=\"\"><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/staylogged\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2925921\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/staylogged\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2925921\" alt=\"\"><\/a><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/staylogged.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/staylogged\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2925921","caption":""},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/staylogged\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2925921","caption":""},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/staylogged\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2925921","caption":""}},"tags":{"inactivity-logout":"inactivity logout","security":"security","stay-logged":"stay logged"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
