Every time someone visits your website they will have the ability to read your positive reviews and also a simplified way to leave a positive review for you on the major review websites.  The system will allow you to filter out negative reviews by directing any review 3 stars or less into a messaging system.  Start My Review allows you to get reviews from Google, Yelp, Yellow Pages, BBB and directly from your WordPress website.  This systems is created in part through the integration of reviews from 3rd party sources. When a positive review is placed on a 3rd party website, it is then parsed for display to the end user by the Start My Review system.
