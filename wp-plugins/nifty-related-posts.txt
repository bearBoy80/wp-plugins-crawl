Includes options for thumbnail size and alignment, excerpt length, related posts per page, and more. Minimal styling and disable CSS option to fit with your theme.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the \\&#8217;nifty-related-posts\\&#8217; folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the \\&#8217;Plugins\\&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Visit the Settings panel to set up Nifty.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Does this plugin use thumbnails for the related posts?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It uses the built-in WP post thumbnail or &#8220;feature image&#8221; for related posts thumbnails. The alignment and thumbnail size can be set in the options panel,<br \/>\nand thumbnails can also be disabled.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Does this plugin work with custom post types?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>At the moment, it does not. I may add custom-post type support in the future, depending on user feedback.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I show related posts by tag or a custom taxonomy?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at this time. This is also a feature I may add in future versions.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I Choose the Number of Related Posts to Show?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This setting is available in the options panel. Nifty is configured to show up to 20 related posts.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Where Can I Get Support?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You may seek community support within the WordPress.org forums. I will try to monitor and assist as needed.
