Stripe is made for developers and testing is a huge part of that. Just be sure to get your api and publishable keys at Stripe.com.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Do I need SSL in test mode?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. But you can use ssl while in test mode.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Do I need SSL in production mode?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. We recommend using SSL to safeguard your users from additional risks.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Are there any filters for this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. In fact, all frontend texts can be managed via the backend settings and frontend images (payment form icons and images) can changed by using these two filters: mesasix_stripe_checkout_icon and mesasix_stripe_cards_icon. We will be adding more features in the next release.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is this safe?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely.

And dont let the fact that this plugin has not been updated for 2 years scare you off that just means the developer perfected and got it right 2 years ago so he has not had to keep fixing all the bugs like everyone else!!  <\/p>\n<p>Highly recommend!!!  Seriously wasted days trying to get a bunch of the other plugins to work smoothly.  I was so happy that i had to take the time to right this review!!  Give it a try you will be happy you did!!\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woocommerce-mesasix-stripe-payment-extension.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woocommerce-mesasix-stripe-payment-extension\/assets\/screenshot-1.PNG?rev=918156","caption":"Backend Settings Page"}},"tags":{"credit-card-payment":"credit card payment","mesasix":"mesasix","stripe":"stripe","woo":"woo","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"http:\/\/mesasix.com\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woocommerce-mesasix-stripe-payment-extension\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=918156","high":false}}
