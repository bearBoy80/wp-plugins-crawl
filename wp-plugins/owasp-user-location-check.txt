That information comes from ipinfo.io, an external service which provides available information on user&#8217;s IP address and does not in any way compromise WordPress security. Once the country of attempted login is identified, the plugin compares current locations with that of the previous successful CMS login within the last 2 hours. If country is different, the plugin flags it as unauthorized login attempt and sends notification to OWASP manager, with recommendation to change CMS password. Email address for OWASP manager is identified in plugin settings as &#8220;Notification email&#8221;.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload entire <code>\/owasp-user-location-check<\/code> folder to <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate plugin through <em>Plugins<\/em> menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested with WP 5.7<\/li>\n<li>Description updated<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested with WP 5.1.1<\/li>\n<li>Added ability to add IP to white and black lists<\/li>\n<li>Added ability to setup E-mail where notices will be send<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested with WP 5.1<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested with WP 5.0.3<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/owasp-user-location-check.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"owasp-location-check":"OWASP location check","owasp-login-validation":"OWASP login validation","owasp-security":"OWASP security","security":"security","wordpress-security":"wordpress security"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
