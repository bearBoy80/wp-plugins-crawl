The Upload, Vote, and Gallery displays were efficient to use.   Getting our implenentation running was a multi-step learning experience.   The terrific array of options provides great implementation flexibility, but can be a bit addling at first.  But NO PROBLEM, because Wasiliy is as prompt as he is gracious in helping me to get all the wheels on tight.  When I ask, \"Wouldn't it be nice if the package could do X?\", the answer is always \"well it does, here is how\", or \"Yes, I will put that on the work list.\".  Bothe the software and its developer are terrific assets to our club.  I am sure it would be a great asset to a much larger, more complex operator of photo contests, as well.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Good customer support<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jerry2\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/2bc0d4184b6325f9f755faa578b3000b?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/2bc0d4184b6325f9f755faa578b3000b?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jerry2\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Jerry2<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 11, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Had a couple of problems that ended up not being plugin related.
