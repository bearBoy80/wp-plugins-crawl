As of its 2.x releases, WordPress enables users to display full scale images by inserting a link to the related file or to the dynamically generated page. mAutoPopup gets further by enabling you to display thoses images on the same page in a &#8220;popup&#8221; layer without the hassle of having to insert a link.<\/p>\n<h4>Key features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Displays full scale images related to thumbnails found into your posts or pages in a &#8220;popup&#8221; layer without loading a new page.<\/li>\n<li>Allows full customization of the &#8220;popup&#8221; layer through a dedicated style sheet.<\/li>\n<li>Automatic detection of &#8220;maximizable&#8221; thumbnails.<\/li>\n<li>Fully integrated with the WordPress internationalization API.<\/li>\n<li>Rich Text Editor plugin<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Fixes and Improvements for version 0.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added lightbox compatibility mode &#8211; Thumbnails identified by mAutoPopup can now be magnified using lightbox (require installed lightbox compatible plugin)<\/li>\n<li>Improved page scrolling tracking &#8211; Introducing smooth move option<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Upcoming additions and improvements<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Dual style sheet editor with Simple and Advanced forms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>System requirements<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP version <strong>4.3.0<\/strong> or higher<\/li>\n<li>Javascript must be enabled on the target web browser<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This plugin is my first contribution to the WordPress community and I hope you&#8217;ll find it useful.<\/p>\n<p>Christophe SAUVEUR<\/p>\n<h3>Usage<\/h3>\n<p>Once activated, mAutoPopup works automatically for any post or page of you weblog. Insert a thumbnail from the Upload Manager of the post editor without any link to the file or the page and mAutoPopup will automatically detect it has a suitable thumbnail for magnification. A thumbnail surrounded any link tag won&#8217;t be detected as suitable.<\/p>\n<p>mAutoPopup works by default for all the pages or posts of you weblog.<br \/>\nHowever, its behavoir can be selected amongst four options :<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Active for all posts and pages (default)<\/li>\n<li>Active for all posts but those where the disabling quicktag is present<\/li>\n<li>Disabled for all posts but those where the enabling quicktag is present <\/li>\n<li>Disabled<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As mentioned, you can define a specific behavoir for some posts by inserting quicktags.<br \/>\nThe disabling quicktag is <!--mautopopup:disable--> and the enabling quicktag is <!--mautopopup:enable-->.<br \/>\nIf the correct behavoir is selected, the presence of one of these quicktags anywhere in a post will alter it.<br \/>\nYou can type it directly into the code editor or, better, use the Rich Text Editor plugin provided along with mAutoPopup from version 0.4.<\/p>\n<h4>Rich Text Editor (TinyMCE) plugin usage<\/h4>\n<p>mAutoPopup 0.4 includes a new rich text editor plugin to enable or disable mAutoPopup or to remove mAutoPopup quicktags from posts and pages.<br \/>\nOnce installed, this plugin shows 3 buttons in the first toolbar of the rich text editor.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enable button<\/strong><br \/>\nAdds the enabling quicktag to the current edited post or page. The quicktag is inserted at the cursor position.<br \/>\n<em>If a disabling quicktag already exists, this button removes it.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Disable button<\/strong><br \/>\nAdds the disabling quicktag to the current edited post or page. The quicktag is inserted at the cursor position.<br \/>\n<em>If an enabling quicktag already exists, this button removes it.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Remove button<\/strong><br \/>\nRemoves any quicktag from the current edited post or page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Online Resources<\/h3>\n<p>If you have any questions that aren&#8217;t addressed in this document, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xhaleera.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our website<\/a> and its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xhaleera.com\/index.php\/products\/wordpress-mseries-plugins\/mautopopup\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">mAutoPopup dedicated section<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Known issues<\/h3>\n<p>Here is the known cases that may prevent mAutoPopup to work properly :<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Rich Text Editor plugin may not be available for some WordPress 2.0+ installations, though other functions of mAutoPopup work perfectly well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>License<\/h3>\n<p>mAutoPopup, as WordPress, is released under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 (see license.txt).<br \/>\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its documentation under the terms of the GNU General Public License is hereby granted.
