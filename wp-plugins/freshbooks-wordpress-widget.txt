This plugin creates a simple sidebar widget that outputs the total hours billed for a FreshBooks account.<\/p>\n<p>Note: You will need the API URL and API token for your FreshBooks account, see <a href=\"http:\/\/developers.freshbooks.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http:\/\/developers.freshbooks.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Your FreshBooks API URL has a single point of entry, derived from your account URL:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sample.freshbooks.com\/api\/2.1\/xml-in\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/sample.freshbooks.com\/api\/2.1\/xml-in<\/a><\/p>\n<p>After enabling API access for your account, you\u2019ll be given a unique authentication token. The admin user, and each staff member, has an API token. The admin user\u2019s authentication token can be found on the &#8220;enable FreshBooks API&#8221; page. The staff token can be found on each staff member\u2019s Profile page, or on the Edit Staff page (for admin only). At this time, staff members have limited access to the API (see the individual method pages for details).<\/p>\n<p>Please note your authentication token is based on your account password. If your password changes, so will your authentication token.<\/p>\n<p>To use this widget, install the plugin and then in the widgets setup admin area drag the &#8220;Freshbooks Widget&#8221; to a sidebar. Input your Title, API URL, and API token. Note, using the Freshbooks Admin API token will return the number hours billed by the Admin user and all the Staff accounts associated with the Admin account (the entire team), whereas inputing a Staff token will output the hours billed by that staff user only.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sailabs.co\/products\/freshbooks-wordpress-widget\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Project Homepage<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/sailabs.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/categories\/200016355-Freshbooks-WordPress-Widget\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Support<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/product-demos.freshbooks-wordpress-widget.sailabs.co\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Demo<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Need WordPress or Ruby on Rails development services? <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sailabs.co\/hire-us\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contact SAI Labs<\/a> to learn about our competitive rates.
