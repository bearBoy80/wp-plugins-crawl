The plugin doesn&#8217;t add a global password to the site, it adds a checkbox to the backend of posts\/pages. If that checkbox is checked a user can only view the page content if they are logged in (you can configure the options to prevent the content from EVER showing up for certain user types). <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You could potentially use the plugin as a global lockout. To do so you&#8217;d want to 1) check the restrict content checkbox on the backend of the content you want to restrict 2) assign your user (someone who you want to grant access to the content) a username \/ password or direct them to create one for themselves 3) ensure the plugin settings allow the correct user type access. I&#8217;d imagine you&#8217;d want to restrict access to subscribers as WordPress usually allows these users to be created by anyone.<\/p>\n<p>If that won&#8217;t work for you I&#8217;d try a plugin like https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/password-protected\/<\/p>\n","changelog":"<ul>\n<li>1.0 &#8211; Initial commit\n<ul>\n<li>1.0.1 &#8211; Plugin cleanup and added translation support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">One Of The Best<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mr-roger-hewison\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/eac66a146967ecbc59749059dbcef695?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/eac66a146967ecbc59749059dbcef695?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mr-roger-hewison\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Mr Roger Hewison<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>I am very Skeptical about using Plugins because this is a Business Website.
