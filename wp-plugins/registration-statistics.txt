You can also click on a point on a graph and choose to view a list of posts that were published on that day or during that month, which may allow you to see what posts might&#8217;ve caused a peak in registrations (and thus gauge what kinds of posts you can make in the future to spur on more registrations).<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to grab development releases, see what new features are being added, or browse the source code please visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/tombenner\/registration-statistics\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repo<\/a>.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>registration-statistics<\/code> to the <code>wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Where should I go for support questions or to ask for a new feature?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please feel free to either add a topic in the WordPress forum or contact me through GitHub for any questions about Registration Statistics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/tags\/registration-statistics?forum_id=10\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress Forum<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/tombenner\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1538996\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1538996\" alt=\"Choosing a predefined date range (&quot;Last 90 Days&quot; in this case)\"><\/a><p>Choosing a predefined date range (\"Last 90 Days\" in this case)<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1538996\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1538996\" alt=\"Choosing a custom date range using datepickers\"><\/a><p>Choosing a custom date range using datepickers<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1538996\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1538996\" alt=\"The interactive graphs that are shown after choosing a date range\"><\/a><p>The interactive graphs that are shown after choosing a date range<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1538996\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1538996\" alt=\"One of the interactive tables that is shown after choosing a date range\"><\/a><p>One of the interactive tables that is shown after choosing a date range<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1538996\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1538996\" alt=\"After clicking on a point on the graph, you can then choose to see posts published on that day or month, which may allow you to see what posts might&#039;ve caused a peak in registrations\"><\/a><p>After clicking on a point on the graph, you can then choose to see posts published on that day or month, which may allow you to see what posts might've caused a peak in registrations<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/registration-statistics.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1538996","caption":"Choosing a predefined date range (\"Last 90 Days\" in this case)"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1538996","caption":"Choosing a custom date range using datepickers"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1538996","caption":"The interactive graphs that are shown after choosing a date range"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1538996","caption":"One of the interactive tables that is shown after choosing a date range"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/registration-statistics\/trunk\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1538996","caption":"After clicking on a point on the graph, you can then choose to see posts published on that day or month, which may allow you to see what posts might've caused a peak in registrations"}},"tags":{"analytics":"analytics","registration":"registration","statistics":"statistics","stats":"stats","tracking":"tracking"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
