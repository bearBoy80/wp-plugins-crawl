In there, you can create simple pricing tables with plan information, lists of features, followed by a call to action button.<\/p>\n<h4>Responsiveness<\/h4>\n<p>There is a basic, responsive stylesheet included with the plugin so everyone can get started with minimal set up, even if not using a supported theme. While you can technically have \u201cunlimited\u201d columns of pricing tables, the default stylesheet will only account for a maximum of five per set.<\/p>\n<h4>Ideal for theme developers<\/h4>\n<p>This plugin is primarily intended to be recommended to users\/customers by theme developers who implement pricing tables in their themes, and want to make sure their users\/customers are able to create pricing tables with portable data that can be retained even if they switch themes.<\/p>\n<p>There are also not, nor ever will be any sort of \u201cPro\u201d version, upsells, ads, surreptitious data tracking or analytics, so theme developers can be confident in recommending a plugin that users won\u2019t find too pushy or annoying. This is the \u201cPro\u201d version already.<\/p>\n<h4>Customizability<\/h4>\n<p>There are not, nor ever will be any in-plugin options to change colors, font sizes, and things of that nature. You are (or the theme you\u2019re using is) expected to deregister the default front-end stylesheet and\/or add your own CSS styles to make such changes.<\/p>\n<p>If you are looking for customization options and\/or not a customer of a theme developer who recommends this plugin, there are other pricing table plugins that are probably a better fit for you.<\/p>\n<h4>Usage<\/h4>\n<p>Creating sets of pricing tables is pretty straightforward.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on \u201cAdd New\u201d under the \u201cPricing Tables\u201d menu item in the admin panel.<\/li>\n<li>Fill out all the plan information for the first plan, including plan title, price, feature list (separated by line break), call to action text and URL.<\/li>\n<li>Click \u201cAdd another plan\u201d and repeat step 2 for any new plans.<\/li>\n<li>Use the arrow buttons to reorder the plans, if necessary.<\/li>\n<li>When finished adding plans for a particular set of pricing tables, click the \u201cPublish\u201d button (or \u201cUpdate\u201d if you were editing a previously published set).<\/li>\n<li>Click back to the \u201cPricing Tables\u201d page to see a list of pricing tables with the relevant shortcode displayed to the right of each. The shortcode will be in the format of <code>[ptp name=\u201cslug\u201d]<\/code> replacing \u201cslug\u201d with whatever the slug of the pricing table is.<\/li>\n<li>Include the shortcode wherever shortcodes are supported to display the relevant set of pricing tables.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Support<\/h4>\n<p>Please note that it\u2019s nearly impossible to make sure the default stylesheet will look good with every unsupported theme. We\u2019re unfortunately unable to support any sort of CSS customization changes like this.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not a user of a theme that advertises support for Pricing Tables Pro, there are probably better fits for you in the pricing table plugin realm. If you are, you can likely get support from whoever sold you the theme.<\/p>\n<p>Any other support requests will likely not receive an official response from us, unless there is a veritable bug that we are able to reproduce.<\/p>\n<h4>Feature Requests<\/h4>\n<p>The goal of this plugin is to be as simple as possible at its core. Therefore, we\u2019re extremely unlikely to cater to any feature requests that would add new fields or options that aren\u2019t already there.<\/p>\n<p>However, we realize that the plugin in its current state could be more flexible through the use of action hooks and filters. If you\u2019re a developer and willing to contribute such changes, please submit a pull request on the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/metrocraft\/pricing-tables-pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pricing Tables Pro GitHub page<\/a>.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Activate Pricing Tables Pro via your preferred method of <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin installation<\/a><\/li>\n<li>See the \u201cUsage\u201d section on the main plugin page for instructions on what to do after that.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Does this plugin include any upsells to a \u201cpro\u201d version or otherwise contain any annoying ads in the backend?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope. One of the main reasons we made this plugin is because every single other pricing table plugin we found does have some sort of upsell or ad in the backend.<\/p>\n<p>We want this to be the preeminent pricing table plugin for theme developers to add styles for in their own themes. And since theme developers typically prefer to recommend plugins that don\u2019t plaster ads all over the place, we figured this plugin filled a need.<\/p>\n<p>This is the \u201cPro\u201d version. No upsell required.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Does this plugin include any sort of customization options so I can change colors and fonts and other stuff like that?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope. If you want to customize stuff like that, you\u2019ll need to add custom CSS to your site somehow. If you have no interest in writing custom CSS and require such options for whatever reason, you\u2019re better off using another pricing table plugin, because we\u2019ll never add any options like that.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I\u2019m a developer. Do you have a GitHub so I can submit a pull request?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure! Please check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/metrocraft\/pricing-tables-pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pricing Tables Pro GitHub page<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Please note that we\u2019re not interested in any pull requests adding color\/font customization options or new pricing table fields. However, we\u2019re very open to stuff like refactoring, localization, and adding hooks and filters to allow for better flexibility without hacking up core plugin files.<\/p>\n<p>While the plugin is totally functional as-is, there\u2019s always room for improvement and an extra set of eyes, so your contributions are always much appreciated.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why didn\u2019t you respond to my support request? \ud83d\ude41<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Themes are our primary business, and we don\u2019t really generate any revenue directly from this plugin, so we really can\u2019t offer a sustained support forum presence. We host the plugin on WordPress.org for convenience.<\/p>\n<p>We do keep an eye on the support forum in case there are veritable bugs that need to be squashed, but otherwise let the WordPress.org community handle stuff beyond that.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t let the low support response rate here steer you away from giving the plugin a shot though! Especially if a theme you use recommends it and offers their own custom styles with it. The plugin is great, we\u2019ve just taken it in a different direction than the others.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pricing-tables-pro\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1201719\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pricing-tables-pro\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1201719\" alt=\"This is a screenshot of the pricing tables using the included CSS styles.\"><\/a><p>This is a screenshot of the pricing tables using the included CSS styles.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pricing-tables-pro\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1201719\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pricing-tables-pro\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1201719\" alt=\"Manage your various pricing tables through a familiar interface.\"><\/a><p>Manage your various pricing tables through a familiar interface.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pricing-tables-pro\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1201719\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pricing-tables-pro\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1201719\" alt=\"A pricing table with two plans.\"><\/a><p>A pricing table with two plans.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pricing-tables-pro\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1201719\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pricing-tables-pro\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1201719\" alt=\"Individual plan settings (1 of 2).

It does not cost money to be nice, doesn\u00b4t it?\n- I saw that the plugin was not updated since last year, and I saw that the latest forum post 3 months ago was ignored, so I went to the github to raise an \"issue\" asking about it: \nhttps:\/\/github.com\/Themetry\/Pricing-Tables-Pro\/issues\/1\nThe answer, well, you can read it: \n\"If there's a reason to update it, I'll update it. If you're looking for frequent, token updates, another plugin might be a better choice.\" (it is really that hard to be nice?)\nI answered to it, but he deleted the comment, it was something like this:\n\"It seems it has not been tested with the latest version of WordPress, if it does work, update it to show it, if not, update it to make it work.\"\nHe removed the comment and block further comments to the topic. \n\nSo, I just came here to write this. And I just write this so people know how the developer of this plugins gives support so they can decide by themselves to trust the plugin or not. Not more, not less. \n\nThank you for providing the plugin. You should improve your support skills. \n\nBest regards\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pricing-tables-pro.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pricing-tables-pro\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1201719","caption":"This is a screenshot of the pricing tables using the included CSS styles."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pricing-tables-pro\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1201719","caption":"Manage your various pricing tables through a familiar interface."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pricing-tables-pro\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1201719","caption":"A pricing table with two plans."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pricing-tables-pro\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1201719","caption":"Individual plan settings (1 of 2).
