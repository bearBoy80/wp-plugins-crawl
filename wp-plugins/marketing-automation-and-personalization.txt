I can do BOTH personalized email marketing &amp; web page pop-ups. I can slowly retire Convertful, my current lead-gen pop tool on my sites as this does the job and more.\nAlso, It's amazing how minutely I can target customers...like only nudging high-ticket customers with new items complimenting their earlier purchases. The possibilities are amazing.\nOther Pros:\n- Quick Updates\n- Experienced &amp; very helpful team behind it. Phew. \ud83d\ude05\n\nCons:\n- Even though the UI is simple, it can take a little while to find stuff.  \nBut if there's anything you can't, the support is relatively quick to respond. \n- Waiting patiently for webhooks to totally make the shift with my other sites.\n\n\nI've been extra cautious about email marketing saas' after suffering a big loss with Automizy. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nAnd it was only after seeing Growmatik's vast experience with Wordpress, that made me finally take the plunge. Plus I really needed to forget about that Automizy mistake \ud83d\ude05. Thankfully, so far I am thoroughly impressed with their power-packed features &amp; the helpful team behind it.
