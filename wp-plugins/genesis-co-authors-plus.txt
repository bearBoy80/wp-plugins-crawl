The Co-Authors plugin allows you to add more than one author to a particular post.<\/p>\n<p>The Genesis framework has an in-built function to display an author box, and the Genesis Co-Authors plugin enables<br \/>\nthe Genesis author box to detect co-authors and display them in additional author boxes.<\/p>\n<p>With this setup, you can create guest authors without creating a user profile for them, just create a &#8216;Guest Author&#8217; via the Co-Authors Plus plugin, and include that guest author in your post. Genesis Co-Authors Plus will then take care of displaying the guest author\/s on the front end.<\/p>\n<p>To enable the Genesis author box please follow the <a href=\"http:\/\/slickwp.com\/add-author-box-genesis-blog\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on this website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Credit<\/h4>\n<p>Created by Jean Galea.
