When your post goes live, the review metadata is transmitted and uploaded straight to OpenCritic.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nWill the review metadata show up on OpenCritic before it&#8217;s published?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Review metadata is only publicly visible after your WordPress post becomes published. If you accidentally publish your post early, you can un-publish the post and the metadata will also be removed from OpenCritic.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nDo I need to do anything after the review is scheduled?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The review metadata should be uploaded once your review&#8217;s status goes from Scheduled to Live.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nWhere do I get the API key?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Log in to the Portal and generate an API key <a href=\"https:\/\/portal.opencritic.com\/wordpress-plugin-api-key\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.
