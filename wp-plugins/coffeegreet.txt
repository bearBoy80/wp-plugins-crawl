The plug-in will fetch images from Flickr by tags you provide. By default, the plug-in will fetch 10 images (this can be set by the &#8216;shuffle&#8217; field on the settings menu). After fetching the images, it would randomly take 1 out of the 10 images to serve to your visitors so that there is variety of servings each page reload. You can also set a default greeting message for your site visitors. Having this plug-in on your blog helps increase your blog&#8217;s exposure and loyal readership. Best of all, this plug-in is compatible with various WordPress cache plug-ins so you do not have to sacrifice speed.<\/p>\n<p>FEATURES:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show a different greeting message to your visitor with a coffee image.

Example: We should type in &#8220;espresso&#8221; as a tag for the morning coffee.   By doing this, we limit the fetched images from Flickr by using the tags that we enter on the boxes; meaning, if someone visits your blog\/site in the morning, the image accompanying the morning greeting will only be those tagged with the text &#8220;espresso&#8221; on Flickr.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Optionally we can set display options for the coffee images like the size and the shuffle amount.Setting a value for shuffle will tell the plugin how many images will be fetched from Flickr. You can enter any number but be careful when inputting a very large value (e.g. 100 or more) as it can affect the loading time of your blog. On the other hand entering a very little value such as 1 will display only From the flickr API we can set valid size labels as follows:<br \/>\ns  &#8211; small square 75&#215;75<br \/>\nt  &#8211; thumbnail, 100 on longest side<br \/>\nm  &#8211; small, 240 on longest side<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>medium, 500 on longest side<br \/>\nz  &#8211; medium 640, 640 on longest side<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; button<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"<ol>\n<li>I installed the plugin but I don&#8217;t see CoffeeGreet on my pages.
