However, looks canbe deceiving, and ARE deceiving in this case!<\/p>\n<p>After installing this plugin, we can't tell what to do next in order to have AMP implemented on our posts and pages for our <a href=\"http:\/\/trainthek9.com\/\">TrainTheK9<\/a> site.  So, we found the following page, which is supposed to be a page with \"intructions\" on how to use this plugin:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ba5nanas.com\/support\/docs\/plugins\/project-amp\/getting-started\/\">http:\/\/www.ba5nanas.com\/support\/docs\/plugins\/project-amp\/getting-started\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>On this page, the English used is so bad it's really just unintelligible.  See if YOU can make heads or tails of this, copied directly from the page:<\/p>\n<p>After installing and Activating \u201cPROJECT AMP\u201d Plugin, open your theme\u2019s create folder \u201camp\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Can you replace page amp on you like.<\/p>\n<p>list page default.<\/p>\n<p>    single.php<br \/>\n    index.php<br \/>\n    page.php<br \/>\n    archive.php<br \/>\n    404.php<br \/>\n    search.php<\/p>\n<p>you can follow tag amp by google or create theme amp on your folder, This\u2019s code https:\/\/github.com\/ampproject\/amphtml<\/p>\n<p>This\u2019s Project run on mobile and tablet only you can debug show on pc.<\/p>\n<p>Seriously?  <\/p>\n<p>So, out of a desire to let the company know about the problem, and to try to get help, we found this page as a \"contact\" page for the company:<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.ba5nanas.com\/support\/contact\/<\/p>\n<p>Here, we wrote the following message to the company:<\/p>\n<p>\"Dear Sirs:<\/p>\n<p>\"This inquiry is regarding this page of your website:<\/p>\n<p>\"http:\/\/www.ba5nanas.com\/support\/docs\/plugins\/project-amp\/getting-started\/<\/p>\n<p>\"The English used on this page makes no sense.  That being the case, the net effect is that there is no support for your WordPress plugin.  This is going to result in some really bad ratings on Wordpress for your plugin if not fixed immediately.<\/p>\n<p>\"We need AMP on our site - both for posts AND pages.  Currently, the only support for AM we can find for a WordPress site is a plugin that only provides AMP support for posts only.  This is unacceptable to us.<\/p>\n<p>\"Please provide support documentation and instructions for using your WordPress plugin in intelligible English.  Otherwise, we will have no choice but to uninstall your plugin from our site and give it a really bad rating for lack of support.\"<\/p>\n<p>When we tried to send the message to the company, we received the following error message at the bottom of the page:<\/p>\n<p>\"Failed to send your message. Please try later or contact the administrator by another method.\"<\/p>\n<p>Again, ...  SERIOUSLY?  What other method would you propose???  Smoke signal???<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is that there really is no support for this plugin.  The site makes it appear as though there is support, but the company appears completely incapable of providing any, at least not in English.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/project-amp.0.2.2.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"amp":"amp","google-amp":"google amp","mobile":"mobile"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/project-amp.0.1.zip","0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/project-amp.0.2.zip","0.2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/project-amp.0.2.1.zip","0.2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/project-amp.0.2.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/project-amp.zip"},"donate_link":"-","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/project-amp\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1364442","high":false}}
