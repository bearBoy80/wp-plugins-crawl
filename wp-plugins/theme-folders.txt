I had enough of the messy theme page on WordPress Backend. As developer I need sometimes a ranking for themes. So I decided,  there have to be a way to label themes or assign a category in this case a folder to them.<\/p>\n<p>That is why I was writing a code to folder WordPress themes.<br \/>\nLoad different groups of themes into the wp-content. Go to the Admin Page under Appearance -&gt; Theme Folders and give the names of the different folders. Now you have folder view of different theme groups.<\/p>\n<p>Then you can preview themes from certain categories or delete them.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload &#8216;theme-folders&#8217; folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Where can I get support?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contact us at http:\/\/www.wp-plugin-dev.com\/support-contact\/<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.2<\/h4>\n<p>Removed icons, tested for WordPress 4.7<\/p>\n<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<p>Initial release<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/theme-folders\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=823050\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/theme-folders\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=823050\" alt=\"Backend\"><\/a><p>Backend<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Good Idea, Poor Design<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"2 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"2\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tprivitor\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b7c236df41c6a7f4c80caf17ce94e5b6?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b7c236df41c6a7f4c80caf17ce94e5b6?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tprivitor\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">tprivitor<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>The interface is too simplistic and there are not enough instructions.
