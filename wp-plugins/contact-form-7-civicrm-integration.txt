With this plugin it is possible to submit a contact to a local or remote CiviCRM system.<\/p>\n<p>This adds a <strong>CiviCRM<\/strong> tab to Contact Form confgurations.  If you enable CiviCRM processing the form will be submitted to the CiviCRM API v3.  For information about using CiviCRM&#8217;s API see https:\/\/docs.civicrm.org\/dev\/en\/latest\/api\/<\/p>\n<p>The API requires an <strong>Entity<\/strong> and an <strong>Action<\/strong>.  You may need to add additional parameters depending for the Entity\/Action you specify.  Use the API Explorer on your CiviCRM system to determine what additional parameters are required.  The form parameters will automatically be included in the API call and the form variables need to match those expected by the API.<br \/>\nFor example, if the API call needs a field called <em>first_name<\/em> then your form template should have a field called <em>first_name<\/em>  (not <em>first-name<\/em> or <em>firstName<\/em> etc)<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/plugin-name<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Use the <strong>Settings &gt; CiviCRM Contact Form 7 Settings<\/strong> screen to configure the plugin, or follow the <strong>Settings<\/strong> link from the plugins page<\/li>\n<li>Enable CiviCRM on each CF7 form.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.9<\/h4>\n<p>Fix for WordPress 5.8<\/p>\n<h4>1.8<\/h4>\n<p>Fix for validation when no local CiviCRM<\/p>\n<h4>1.7<\/h4>\n<p>Added validation to settings page<br \/>\nAdded link to settings from plugins page<\/p>\n<h4>1.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated readme<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated readme<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated text domain<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated data handling and added a path for the civicrm installation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated readme<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed text domain<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial commit<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/contact-form-7-civicrm-integration\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2410168\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/contact-form-7-civicrm-integration\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2410168\" alt=\"This screenshot shows the settings screen\"><\/a><p>This screenshot shows the settings screen<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/contact-form-7-civicrm-integration\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1348876\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/contact-form-7-civicrm-integration\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1348876\" alt=\"This screenshot shows the screen for enabling and setting up CiviCRM integration on a contact form.\"><\/a><p>This screenshot shows the screen for enabling and setting up CiviCRM integration on a contact form.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Works brilliantly when it works.

I love the flexibility of the API\/form processor approach, which basically lets you do anything API v3 can do. The functionality is better than the Caldera Forms it replaced and it's free!\n\nThe catch is it's really quite difficult to set up because the documentation is incomplete and debugging is difficult (the \"API REST Log\" extension in CiviCRM looks useful but I couldn't get it to work). \n\nThe two big \"gotchas\" that caught me were the example CiviCRM path was wrong for WordPress (should be <strong>wp-json\/civicrm\/v3\/rest<\/strong>) and the names of the form fields must match the entity names in the API, some of which (custom fields) are quite hard to discover.\n\nThe problem is, there are a lot of things you have to get right (paths, permissions, API keys, variable names, API and PHP versions) and there are so many permutations of all of these that if it doesn't work you can spend days and days googling for clues and tearing hair out.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/contact-form-7-civicrm-integration.1.9.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/contact-form-7-civicrm-integration\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2410168","caption":"This screenshot shows the settings screen"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/contact-form-7-civicrm-integration\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1348876","caption":"This screenshot shows the screen for enabling and setting up CiviCRM integration on a contact form."}},"tags":{"cf7":"cf7","civicrm":"civicrm","contact-form-7":"contact form 7"},"versions":{"1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/contact-form-7-civicrm-integration.1.5.zip","1.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/contact-form-7-civicrm-integration.1.6.zip","1.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/contact-form-7-civicrm-integration.1.7.zip","1.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/contact-form-7-civicrm-integration.1.8.zip","1.9":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/contact-form-7-civicrm-integration.1.9.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/contact-form-7-civicrm-integration.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/civicoop.org\/","banners":[]}
