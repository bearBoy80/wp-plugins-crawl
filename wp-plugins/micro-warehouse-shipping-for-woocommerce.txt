This add-on plugin will only work with quoting plugins published by Eniture Technology that are installed and activated on your website.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin allows for individual products to be made available for quoting purposes from more than one (but not all) dropship locations. This is a hybrid of the \u201cwarehouse\u201d and \u201cdropship\u201d ship-from locations normally found in the Eniture Technology quoting plugins. When an item in the shopping cart is assigned to more than one dropship location, the one closest to the ship-to address is used as the ship-from location for quoting purposes.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update: Compatibility with WooCommerce HPOS(High-Performance Order Storage)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update: The plugin name updated as &#8220;Micro-warehouse Shipping Quotes&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update: Updated plugin name as Change of web services endpoint. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update: Change of web services endpoint. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update: Compatibility with WordPress version 6.0.2<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update: Accommodate changes of Freight Class and NMFC Number in LTL Freight Quotes plugins.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/micro-warehouse-shipping-for-woocommerce.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"freight":"freight","ltl":"LTL","ltl-freight":"LTL freight","shipping":"shipping","small":"small"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
