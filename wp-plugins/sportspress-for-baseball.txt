To do an automatic install of SportsPress for Baseball, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.<\/p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;SportsPress for Baseball&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you&#8217;ve found our baseball plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you&#8217;re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.<\/p>\n<h4>Manual Installation<\/h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our baseball plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it<\/li>\n<li>Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation&#8217;s wp-content\/plugins\/ directory.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Upgrading<\/h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.<\/p>\n<p>If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the event\/team\/player\/staff pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress &gt; Settings &gt; Permalinks and hitting &#8216;save&#8217;.

Baseball and Softball coaches use on field scoring apps like GameChanger (widely used) and iScore (not as widely used) and being able to import our stats into this plugin would make it the killer plugin. I'd pay the additional amount no problem.\n\nSecondly, there needs to be an easier way to customize your event pages to show box scores for Offense \/ Defense and Pitching individually.\n\nNow for the overwhelming positives:\n- Ability to add a YouTube playlist of the game to an Event\n- Easy to import scores and create your own equations for stats\n- Nice customization options at a FREE level\n\nGuys this thing can be really awesome! Seriously, get Gamechanger stat imports and your 99% the way there.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sportspress-for-baseball.1.0.2.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sportspress-for-baseball\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1404372","caption":"The Edit Game screen."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sportspress-for-baseball\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1404372","caption":"Game results with home team ahead at bottom of the 9th."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sportspress-for-baseball\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1404372","caption":"Box score with separate batting and pitching statistics."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sportspress-for-baseball\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1404372","caption":"Player statistics in a pitcher's profile page."}},"tags":{"players":"players","sport":"sport","sports":"sports","statistics":"statistics","stats":"stats"},"versions":{"0.9":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sportspress-for-baseball.0.9.zip","0.9.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sportspress-for-baseball.0.9.1.zip","0.9.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sportspress-for-baseball.0.9.2.zip","1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sportspress-for-baseball.1.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sportspress-for-baseball.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sportspress-for-baseball.1.0.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sportspress-for-baseball.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/tboy.co\/donate","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sportspress-for-baseball\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1673250","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sportspress-for-baseball\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1673250"}}
