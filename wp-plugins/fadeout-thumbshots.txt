The script sends a request for the thumbnail to the service of http:\/\/fadeout.de. If the URL is requested for the first time, it&#8217;ll be put in a queue &#8211; and you see a &#8220;coming soon&#8221;. After a few moments the thumbnail is created at fadeout.de, so if you hover the link, the request for the thumbnail is successful and it&#8217;s served and shown correctly.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>2.01<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You may additionally use the CSS class &#8220;nofadeout&#8221; to explicitly disable the preview tooltip for single hyperlinks when using the preview types &#8220;all&#8221; or &#8220;external&#8221;. (Thx to David A. for his suggest)<\/li>\n<li>Add an option to exclude URLs from being previewed. (Thx to Zale for suggesting this)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added an option to choose the fading direction of the images (right = big to small \/ left = small to big).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.999<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added an option to define where the javascript code should be placed on a page (in html head tag or the footer).<\/li>\n<li>Added an input field for page IDs to limit the plugin to only explicitely defined pages. This is a very basic version at the moment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.99<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed a variable name which caused trouble with the start page definition (Thx Frank)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new config option for a localized dummy tooltip (de = &#8220;Thumbshot wird erstellt&#8221;; en = &#8220;coming soon&#8221;).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Set thumbnail border to &#8220;none&#8221; because of some buggy css stylesheets.<\/li>\n<li>Added a filter, so that only http* links are previewed automatically when the setting &#8220;external&#8221; or &#8220;all&#8221; is set. (Thx Bernhard)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Deleted a needless whitespace character that might have caused some problems with other plugins.<\/li>\n<li>Created some better background images (the tooltip border images). I hope you&#8217;ll like them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed opacity from 0.8 to 0.9 for a better image representation.<\/li>\n<li>Added option to adjust the tooltip opacity.<\/li>\n<li>Corrected a padding value (at scaling 180px \u00d7 212px).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the possibility to choose from different tooltip sizes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Surrounded the wp_head() function with the plugins_loaded() method<br \/>\nto avoid some issues regarding the &#8220;headers already sent&#8221; error.<\/li>\n<li>Added a default configuration.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>corrected a dumb mistake (plugin path)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the initial version.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/fadeout-thumbshots\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1539439\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/fadeout-thumbshots\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1539439\" alt=\"This screenshot shows the tooltip preview which is shown while holding the mouse cursor over the WordPress.org hyperlink.\"><\/a><p>This screenshot shows the tooltip preview which is shown while holding the mouse cursor over the WordPress.org hyperlink.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/fadeout-thumbshots.2.01.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/fadeout-thumbshots\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1539439","caption":"This screenshot shows the tooltip preview which is shown while holding the mouse cursor over the WordPress.org hyperlink."}},"tags":{"image":"image","preview":"preview","thumbshot":"thumbshot","tooltip":"tooltip"},"versions":{"1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/fadeout-thumbshots.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/fadeout-thumbshots.1.3.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/fadeout-thumbshots.1.4.zip","1.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/fadeout-thumbshots.1.7.zip","1.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/fadeout-thumbshots.1.8.zip","1.9":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/fadeout-thumbshots.1.9.zip","1.99":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/fadeout-thumbshots.1.99.zip","1.999":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/fadeout-thumbshots.1.999.zip","2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/fadeout-thumbshots.2.0.zip","2.01":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/fadeout-thumbshots.2.01.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/fadeout-thumbshots.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.mynakedgirlfriend.de\/","banners":[]}
