Imagine the scenario, there is a user on your site and they are about to leave. Normally the only incentive you can give them to stay or subscribe is a pop-up with a discount code, free shipping deal etc. Ok. But not engaging. And research has shown that simple exit pop-up discount codes largely go unused. People just don\u2019t feel engaged enough to use them.This is where Buzzsubs comes in.<\/p>\n<p>Now imagine that instead of a simple pop up window to click, they are faced with a wheel of fortune. And all they need to do is to submit their email and it spins, giving them a chance of winning any number of cool prizes &#8211; from discount codes, free shipping etc. They are locked in. The evidence is clear: by gamifying the exit pop-up you will get 10x more (in most cases even more) email subscribers. Not only that, these subscribers are already actively engaged with your store. You\u2019ve triggered real brand awareness and a desire to find out more. And active subscribers always lead to way higher conversions to sale. That\u2019s bigger profits.<\/p>\n<p>With Buzzsubs, your store is a winner every time!<\/p>\n<p>You are required to create a separate Buzzsubs account. After you created your account, you can login to the dashboard using following link:  <a href=\"https:\/\/wp.buzzsubs.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BuzzSubs dashboard<\/a>. The extension itself is free, but the service is not. The extensions costs 15$ per month. You will be given 3 trial days and at any time you can cancel the subscription and will not be charged.<\/p>\n<p>With Buzzsubs, you can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customise your pop-ups to fit your store<\/li>\n<li>Change language<\/li>\n<li>Change colors<\/li>\n<li>Use pre-installed event templates to increase traffic<\/li>\n<li>Set automatic scheduling for your pop-ups<\/li>\n<li>Push all your email subscriptions automatically to MailChimp, Claviey etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<p>Upload the BuzzSubs plugin to your blog, Activate it, register an account and you&#8217;re done!<\/p>\n<p><em>When using BuzzSubs plugin, some other plugin, that makes your blog into a store is required.

Very smooth and integrates well. My only problem is that it has a monthly subscription rate instead of a one off purchase price.\n\nShopify is used to it, but wordpress plugins are usually one off prices. Still, its a great plugin. Would recommend.\n\nI suggest adding a new way to automatically generate unique coupon codes depending on the user and having them automatically expire after a few days. Also implementation for cash back apps would be helpful.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/tkdigital-buzzsubs.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/tkdigital-buzzsubs\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1732649","caption":"If you want BuzzSubs app to show to all users, not just in your preview, please enable it."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/tkdigital-buzzsubs\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1732649","caption":"Customize your JackPot or Wheel of fortune to suite your needs."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/tkdigital-buzzsubs\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1732649","caption":"If your store is not in English, you can use translations section to change It that suits your needs."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/tkdigital-buzzsubs\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1732649","caption":"Use Coupon slices and Coupon code bar sections to setup what discount codes and where the client will see."},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/tkdigital-buzzsubs\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1732649","caption":"Use placement ant triggers to setup in what pages and when the user will see BuzzSubs script."}},"tags":{"buzzsubs":"buzzsubs","discounts":"discounts","popups":"popups"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/tkdigital-buzzsubs\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1732649","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/tkdigital-buzzsubs\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1732649"}}
