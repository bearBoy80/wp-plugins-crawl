When that happens, it&#8217;s time to ask people in a forum or email a friend. They&#8217;ll probably be better able to help diagnose your challenges if they can quickly scan some of the basic settings of your site, your site&#8217;s host, and gain a general idea of the number of posts, pages and media that are on your site.<\/p>\n<p>This widget resides on the dashboard and uses the standard dashboard widget &#8220;Configure&#8221; link. It can be easily hidden or revealed via the screen options pulldown, just like any other dashboard item. It can be dragged to either column to suit your needs.<\/p>\n<p>These are the items this plugin lists:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WordPress Version<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Themes<\/strong> alphabetically with version and the active theme indicated, plus the total number of installed themes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Plugins<\/strong> alphabetically with version and activation indicated, plus the number of active and total plugins.<\/li>\n<li><strong>WordPress Config<\/strong> with various configured settings that could be helpful.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hosting and System Config<\/strong> with Server version, PHP version, MySQL version, some PHP settings.<\/li>\n<li><strong>PHP Extensions<\/strong> alphabetically, comma-separated, 4 to a row.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Apache Modules<\/strong> alphabetically, comma-separated, 3 to a row, if the information is available.<\/li>\n<li><strong>General Site Statistics<\/strong> should be self evident.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Get the zipped file <code>diagnostic_glance.zip<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Unzip it to its own folder <code>diagnostic_glance<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Upload <code>diagnostic_glance<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Go to the dashboard from the admin menu to view the <strong>Diagnostic Glance<\/strong> dashboard.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20this%20nifty%20tool%3F'>\nHow do I use this nifty tool?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the dashboard in your WordPress website. <\/li>\n<li>Locate the Diagnostic Glance panel. <\/li>\n<li>If diagnostic information isn&#8217;t showing up, click <code>Configure<\/code> to show sections and <code>Submit<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Click the <code>Copy to Clipboard<\/code> button.
