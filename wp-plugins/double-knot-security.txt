If the submitted user name meets settings criteria the IP will be blocked from the site.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin also has the ability to stop author enumeration by bots.<\/p>\n<h4>Recommended Settings<\/h4>\n<p>There are two different ways to protect your site from user name brute force attacks.  The more strict way is to immediately block an IP that attempts to login with a non-existent user name.  This can possibly cause issues with websites that have many users or users that may not login very often and forget their user name.  It&#8217;s most useful for one-person websites.<\/p>\n<p>The less strict way is to have a black list of user names that only a bot would try like &#8220;admin&#8221; and user nicenames that aren&#8217;t logins.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Stop Enumeration&#8221; setting redirects all attempts to ?author={ID} to the home page of your site.  This will stop bots from incrementing through your users and discovering user nicenames.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Install like any other plugin, directly from your plugins page.
