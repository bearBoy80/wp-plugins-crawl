I love a challenge and wanted to see if it would work on one of my websites as this is the very first plugin I&#8217;ve ever developed for WordPress. I also wanted to make it available free of charge as I am excited about learning Python and PHP, and I would like to contribute to the software development community beyond Twitter and GitHub. As a newbie freelance software developer, I thought this would also be a great opportunity to add experience to my resume by publishing a plugin to the mostly widely used content management system in the world, one that I&#8217;ve used for almost a decade as a hobbyist Web Administrator and Front-End Web Developer, which is WordPress.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20send%20you%20a%20donation%3F'>\nCan I send you a donation?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>I thought you&#8217;d never ask, and you most certainly can!
