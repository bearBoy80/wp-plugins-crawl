It is not good to have 10k spam comments saved in the database, because all of these comments can increase consistently the size of the mysql database backups.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a lot of published posts, you may have post revisions and auto-drafts saved in the database, that can slow down the database performances. All this data is considered junk and it should be cleaned frequently.<\/p>\n<h4>Key Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Delete post revisions<\/li>\n<li>Delete auto drafts<\/li>\n<li>Delete pending comments<\/li>\n<li>Delete spam comments<\/li>\n<li>Delete trash comments<\/li>\n<li>Delete tags with 0 posts associated<\/li>\n<li>Delete categories with 0 posts associated<\/li>\n<li>Delete trash posts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>More Information<\/h4>\n<p>For more details visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wpmize.com\/wordpress-plugins\/optimize-wordpress-database-wp-database-cleaner\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the official plugin URL<\/a>.<br \/>\nFor more plugins and WordPress tips visit us at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wpmize.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wpmize.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Author<\/h3>\n<p>WPMize.com<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/www.wpmize.com<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Place the &#8216;wp-database-cleaner&#8217; folder in your &#8216;\/wp-content\/plugins\/&#8217; directory.<\/li>\n<li>Activate WP Database Cleaner.<\/li>\n<li>Visit &#8216;DatabaseCleaner&#8217; to optimize the database.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Should I make a backup of the Database before use WP Database Cleaner ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is always recommended that the first time you use WP Database Cleaner you make a backup of the database.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<p>02\/08\/2012 =<br \/>\n* Initial release<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-database-cleaner\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1567474\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-database-cleaner\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1567474\" alt=\"Main Interface.\"><\/a><p>Main Interface.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">delete 986 trashed posts in 2 seconds<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/aehageman\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/5078e6d598306b2d15ac6774dc38d434?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/5078e6d598306b2d15ac6774dc38d434?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/aehageman\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">aehageman<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 7, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>Normally I do not review plugins after one use.
