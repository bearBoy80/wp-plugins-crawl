2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>I posted several problems I am having with IProperty (a pale copy of EZrealty which started as a Joomla component) - the late replies - that I never got in my emails by the way so I was not even aware of any reply - was \"Hi-- this is the \"Questions About IP\" forum. Please do not post support questions here. Moving to IP Support Forums\"<\/p>\n<p>I AM ON THE SUPPORT FORUM!!! I checked several times back and forth and I WAS on the support forum...sheeeshhh....<\/p>\n<p>$225 for one year!!! WOW...for $225 you get no support at all? I mean really???<\/p>\n<p>I had to pay another $200 to a programmer so he could fix all the problems.<\/p>\n<p>TOPIC: Error with images upload - Never got a reply - posted 2 weeks ago. And NO it was not my themes. Glitch in the plugin. I tested it on other test sites with basic WP themes and I had the same problems. NOT FIXED with your team that's for sure.<\/p>\n<p>TOPIC: All properties page - sent me to another forum &gt; I WAS ON THE RIGHT SUPPORT FORUM. 2 weeks ago<\/p>\n<p>TOPIC: Double title - Double bullets - not my theme either - tested it with basic wp theme and same result - sent me to another forum &gt; I WAS ON THE RIGHT SUPPORT FORUM. 2 weeks ago<\/p>\n<p>And on and on. The only reply I got for the \"install failed\" because you have to extract from the zip like five time to get to the right folder - I never received the email that I had a reply so..I never checked again. I finally found the solution myself.<\/p>\n<p>So here we are - paying a bunch of money for a plugin that frankly could be great but NOT a nice team at all - no support or stupid useless reply -  no email when by miracle someone replies.<\/p>\n<p>I know WordPress plugins for real estate are really virtually all bad - again, this one could be great with a little work fixing the problems and a much nicer team to work with would be even better.<\/p>\n<p>Cost me all together near $400 so all the bugs are fixed now and it looks nice. Fix the bugs we are talking about in your forum instead of ignoring us - be nice and you will be almost there!<\/p>\n<p>A stupid detail frankly: instead of having 4 folders that gives you an \"Install failed\" CAN YOU FIX that??? I mean really! Should not be too hard and your clients would stop asking you why it does not install.<\/p>\n<p>This post will probably disappear but at least you will read it so hopefully that will help others.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/intellectual-property-basic.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/intellectual-property-basic\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=699424","caption":"All properties view"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/intellectual-property-basic\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=699424","caption":"A single property's details"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/intellectual-property-basic\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=707675","caption":"Single agent view"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/intellectual-property-basic\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=707675","caption":"Viewing all agents"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/intellectual-property-basic\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=707675","caption":"Company view"},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/intellectual-property-basic\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=707675","caption":"Advanced search"},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/intellectual-property-basic\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=707676","caption":"Single property admin screen"},"8":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/intellectual-property-basic\/assets\/screenshot-8.png?rev=707675","caption":"Category view"}},"tags":{"estate-agency":"estate agency","property":"property","property-management":"property management","real-estate":"real-estate","realestate":"realestate"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/intellectual-property-basic\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=706187","high":false}}
