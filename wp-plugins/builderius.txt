I'm not a developer and use low code page builders to build websites. I've been building websites for about 6 years but never took the time to learn code.<br \/><br \/>I've tried a few page builders such as Elementor, Divi, Kadence, Oxygen, Brizy, Cwicly, Pinegrow and Bricks. I found Bricks the easiest page builder to use.<br \/><br \/>Two years ago I discovered Kevin Geary on YouTube and by following him I feel that I've learned a lot about HTML and CSS. Despite page builder claims, I'm able to see for myself if page builders claims of no bloat is true.<br \/><br \/>About a year ago, Bricks was my number one page builder. However, they are going through a corrective phrase. Bricks started as an Elementer competitor, IMO, but now cleaned their HTML output. The HTML output is compatible with coding your own website. As a result, there's been breaking changes. At one point, I had to delay any updates for about 4 months. That began my search for a new page builder and I discovered Builderius.<br \/><br \/>I looked at Builderius previously, but after seeing the number of installs from the WP plugin directory, I instantly dismissed it. Well, that just showed my ignorance of the time. The second time round, I went to their website and saw Graphql.&nbsp; I googled and searched YouTube videos and was instantly amazed by the power of Graphql. Being able to query anything in the WP database but unlike Rest API, you only query the data that you need not all the info within the api end point.<br \/><br \/>Builderius is under estimated or just unknown. You can connect to external resource and populate the data. Facets are native. Search function, you can build components, build tables and more. Builderius can replace many plugins that you have a recurring cost. Above all, I like three things about Builderius. Their support, you may say this should be standard, but it's not. Agnostic approach is an appeal. I've asked them to copy other builders, and they have said no. Innovation, no one else has Graphql and as many features as Builderius. Not just that, but with clean code. While technical and theirs a learning curve. Builderius understands this and is in the process of lowering the barrier to entry. Without removing the flexibility of coding geniuses .<br \/><br \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">For the diehard coders, The missing piece from SITE builders!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ikareem\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e6adb0e1ab076202c4461507062fe42e?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e6adb0e1ab076202c4461507062fe42e?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ikareem\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Kareem <small>(ikareem)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 18, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">I got to admit, it's a promising tool missing from WordPress Builders.<br \/>It doesn't force you to use a theme or plugin.

And Builderius is doing just that. I love the level of control we retain over the individual CSS and HTML within Builderius. Wow!<br \/><br \/>I have also noticed the team's communications and engagement with the community, and it has caught my attention. It's nice to see that kind of love for a product.<br \/><br \/>My personal plea to the team is for them to explore the implications of server-side rendering of HTML (via Php for WordPress) vs. utilizing frameworks like React which generate HTML client side. There are serious tradeoffs to be made here between the user having an \"app-like experience\" once the page actually loads with client-side rendering but at the cost of slower initial page loads to the load the Javascript, and SEO penalties related to more requests needing to be made by the Google crawler to render the HTML. No claims of being an expert here myself, but it's a topic truly worth of investigation in the context of Builderius' mission to stay ahead of the competition in being both performant, SEO-rich, and developer-focused. Perhaps there are resources I can share with the team about this topic, although I am a fairly new developer myself.<br \/><br \/>I am deeply curious about what other IDE-like elements can be incorporated into Builderius. I am thinking it would be cool to see ways where we could directly tap into the SQL database from the pagebuilder itself for example and leverage that for dynamic content. It will be interesting to see how the Builderius team takes their philosophy of empowering the developers on WordPress to the next level in 2023.<br \/><br \/>I give this a solid 5 stars and commend the team for the consistent and persistent improvements and updates to the project.<br \/><br \/><em><strong>-Smithy Fresh, \"Action Potential\"<br \/>\ud83d\udc08\u200d\u2b1bPanther Productions<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Powerhouse tool that deserves waaaay more attention<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/thisbit\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/bb2107a0211023e0f07d1a8b516f4b13?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/bb2107a0211023e0f07d1a8b516f4b13?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/thisbit\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">thisbit<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 4, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Builderius is an amazing tool! Recently I finally took some time to explore it, and I am blown away. Builderius is not trying to dazzle you with cheep tricks, but really focuses on real dev problems to solve.\n\nOnce you figure out the logic of the tool it is amazing what it can do, it allowes complete control of any aspect of the markup, it is fast and flexible and utterly fun to work with. Its powefull GraphQl queries open up the world of data querying and transforming.\n\nI absolutely recomend it to anyone who wants to build real custom solutions with WP.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Very clean code<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/michelkusters\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/83fe9c10e8f667bd14f35485103eeb33?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/83fe9c10e8f667bd14f35485103eeb33?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/michelkusters\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Michel Kusters <small>(michelkusters)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 27, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This is a great plugin.
