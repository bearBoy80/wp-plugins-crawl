WordPress 2.9 introduced support for<br \/>\npost thumbnails but one problem is that the support is not backwards compatible\u2014meaning that if you downloaded or created<br \/>\na theme that supports post thumbnails, any images uploaded prior to the activation of that theme will not have the new thumbnail size.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Installation is easy. Unzip into your wp-content\/plugins directory and activate. Thumbnail Updater can be accessed through<br \/>\nthe Media Library. Navigate to Media Library, click on any image and you should a button that says &#8220;Update Image Sizes.&#8221; Clicking<br \/>\non that will open a popup that lists all of the available image sizes. If a thumbnail size exists for that image, there will be a<br \/>\ncheck next it. If the thumbnail size doesn&#8217;t exist, then a red exclamation mark will appear.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>thumbnail-update<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>That&#8217;s all!<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Hey! Your plugin keeps saying Error! What&#8217;s wrong?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Possibly permission problems. If you&#8217;re like me, you probably have a two-year-old blog and have switched hosts at least three times<br \/>\nin that last year. What does that have to do with permissions? Well, some of your older uploads\u2014those dating prior to your last<br \/>\nwebhost change\u2014either A) don&#8217;t have the folders and files set to 777 and 666 (respectively) or B) Owner:group isn&#8217;t set to www-data:www-data.<br \/>\nThe first problem is relatively easy to deal with using any good FTP program. The second problem requires that your web-host allows<br \/>\nshell-access to their servers. If not, you&#8217;ll have to contact them to get the groups changed. Finally, I&#8217;ve run into some issues with<br \/>\nthe oldest files on my server. It didn&#8217;t matter if I changed permissions or owners on the directory or files, I still could not get thumbnails to generate.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin now has an interface instead of just a button that updates the thumbnail.<\/li>\n<li>Interface uses the same principles as the WordPress Image Editor interface.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1b<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin launch.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/thumbnail-updater\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1539227\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/thumbnail-updater\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1539227\" alt=\"The location of the &quot;Update Image Sizes&quot; button.\"><\/a><p>The location of the \"Update Image Sizes\" button.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/thumbnail-updater\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1539227\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/thumbnail-updater\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1539227\" alt=\"Appearance of the Update Media Thumbnail interface.\"><\/a><p>Appearance of the Update Media Thumbnail interface.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/thumbnail-updater.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/thumbnail-updater\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1539227","caption":"The location of the \"Update Image Sizes\" button."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/thumbnail-updater\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1539227","caption":"Appearance of the Update Media Thumbnail interface."}},"tags":{"images":"images","media-library":"media library","post-thumbnails":"post thumbnails"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/thumbnail-updater.1.0.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/dumpster-fairy.com\/","banners":[]}
