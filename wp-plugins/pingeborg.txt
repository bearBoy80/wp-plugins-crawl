You can distribute stickers\/posters with NFC tags and\/or QR codes in your town or building and offer location based content. It also supports geofences.<\/p>\n<h4>Many different use cases<\/h4>\n<p>The plugin manages URLs and refreshes content for NFC-tags, QR-codes on stickers and posters or geofences, making possible a wide variety of time-dependent and location-based applications in public places. Here are just some of the things which can be done:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can <strong>promote local artists<\/strong> with samples of their work, as we on <a href=\"http:\/\/pingeb.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Project Ingeborg<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>You can distribute <strong>e-books or songs<\/strong> that are out of copyright or to which you have rights.<\/li>\n<li>You can surprise people with a <strong>daily YouTube video<\/strong> or a song from Soundcloud.<\/li>\n<li>You can post <strong>a photo-of-the-day<\/strong> which people can access with their smartphones.<\/li>\n<li>You can offer a <strong>daily insider tip<\/strong> for restaurants or bars around town.<\/li>\n<li>You can <strong>introduce developers and their apps<\/strong> and offer links to their pages in app stores.<\/li>\n<li>You can <strong>promote your own blog or website<\/strong> around town and do all kinds of advertising for just about anything.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stadiums, museums or exhibitions<\/strong> can locate visitors indoor and deliver location-based information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In other words, you can do a lot with this WordPress-plugin and simple NFC-tags, QR-codes or geofences. Without having to change the stickers or posters you can provide fresh content either at all or at selected locations.<\/p>\n<p>For the end user it\u2019s really simple to use:<br \/>\n1. Switch on your NFC-enabled smartphone and hold it against a sticker or photograph the QR-code.<br \/>\n2. A mobile website featuring the content will then be opened.<br \/>\n3. The song or e-book on offer is then just one tap away.<\/p>\n<h4>Workflow<\/h4>\n<p>The plugin works in conjunction with the \u201cLeaflet MapsMarker\u201d plugin, which is also available for free. Both extend the functionality of WordPress and are very easy to use. The workflow sequence is as follows:<br \/>\n1. Add locations in MapsMarker<br \/>\n2. Assign URLs to the locations<br \/>\n3. Assign content to each location either individually or in a batch<\/p>\n<h4>Twitter integration<\/h4>\n<p>You can tweet anytime a user downloads an item from your stickers or the geofence-location. Setup is easy, you only have to register as a [Twitter devloper] (https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/).<\/p>\n<h4>Maintenance section<\/h4>\n<p>A handy tool lets you check for possibly removed or dead stickers or posters.<\/p>\n<h4>API<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>RESTful API<\/strong> gives third-party developers easy access to the location data and download-counts to build on them. A documentation of the API can be found at <a href=\"http:\/\/pep.pingeb.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pep.pingeb.org<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Other Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin generates random <strong>URLs for NFC-tags and QR-codes<\/strong> that connect to the content. QR-codes generated within the plugin can be copied easily to any layout program for stickers or posters. Because the plugin supports <strong>geofence<\/strong>, it is not even necessary to use stickers or posters.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Changing the mobile content<\/strong> (pages in WordPress) for all locations or just one is done with only two mouse clicks.<\/li>\n<li>A <strong>maintenance section<\/strong> helps you identify stickers that have been inactive for a while and that may even have been removed.<\/li>\n<li>Via shortcodes you can easily set up a <strong>statistics<\/strong> page that shows, for example, the NFC- vs. QR-ratio or the latest downloads on a heatmap. A counter on your site allows you to display today\u2019s downloads, the total number of downloads and the number of active locations.<\/li>\n<li>The \u201cLeaflet Maps Marker\u201d-plugin enables you to automatically generate a <strong>map with all your locations<\/strong> on your site. It also permits you to use the locations in an <strong>augmented reality<\/strong> app like Wikitude.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Documentation<\/h4>\n<p>A detailed documentation can be found on Github at <a href=\"http:\/\/pep.pingeb.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pep.pingeb.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>We are curious<\/h4>\n<p>If you use the plugin, we are curious about your opinion and use case.

The idea behind is simple and powerful: People need to be at a specific location (plus a configurable radius) in order to call the content. While it\u2019s obvious what to do if you roll out stickers, you have to communicate more if you want to use geofences. Why? It is simply not obvious to the user. How should anyone know about it? Plus: You have to find obvious locations. An example would be: Tell the people to open http:\/\/yoursite.com anytime the see a subway station.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Q: For my project, I want to write an iPhone\/Android app too. Can I do this?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Absolutely. After installing the plugin on your WordPress site, there\u2019s a set of APIs than can be used for it.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Q: I found bugs or want to add features. How can I do that?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Just go to the git site of the project and start: <a href=\"http:\/\/pep.pingeb.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pep.pingeb.org<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Q: Why should I use random Urls?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: You do not have to. This makes the content accessible (almost) exclusively via mobile devices.  Accessed in a conventional way, a project like pingeb.org would be no more than one of many websites, but because action on the part of the user is necessary, this raises the regard for the free piece of art featured and increases the fun of discovering new artists. If you want to, URLs can also be made more \u201cspeaking\u201d and obvious.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<p>2.0.3.2<br \/>\nFix: Custom HTML block stay assigned after batch assign assign page to tags.<\/p>\n<p>2.0.3.1<br \/>\nNew Feature: Custom HTML blocks can be added to specific tags.<\/p>\n<p>2.0.2.1<br \/>\nFix: Several API Bugfixes.<\/p>\n<p>2.0.2.0<br \/>\nFix: pingeb.org can now also works in wordpress subdirectory installations.<br \/>\nFix: No warning if leaflet mapsmarker pro is installed instead of standard maps marker.<br \/>\nFix: Widget does not throw a warning anymore.<br \/>\nUI: Content squares now have a little more space.<br \/>\nNew Feature: EPUB and MOBI files can now be uploaded using wordpress media.<br \/>\nNew Feature: Tag-API now also deliver geofence Url.<\/p>\n<p>2.0.1.1<br \/>\nFix: Content Squares vertical padding fixed<br \/>\nNew Feature: \/api\/systemStatistics now also shows configured geofence url<\/p>\n<p>2.0.1.0<br \/>\nBug Fix: Twitter now works again<br \/>\nNew Feature: SoundCloud Widget<br \/>\nNew Feature: Push new Articles using GCM Push<br \/>\nNew Feature: Push updated Tags using GCM Push<\/p>\n<p>2.0.0.3<br \/>\nBug Fix: Heatmap Callback Url<\/p>\n<p>2.0.0.2<br \/>\nBug fix: Counter Widget now also show only locations on enabled layers.<br \/>\nBug fix: Fixed UI problem with content squares on mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>2.0.0.1<br \/>\nNew Feature: New content square &#8216;Vimeo&#8217;<br \/>\nNew Feature: Layer-Filter Setting for tags API.<\/p>\n<p>2.0.0.0<br \/>\nNew Feature: pingeb.org content can now be autogenerated for each content page, by setting custom fields in WYSIWYG editor.<br \/>\nNew Feature: API call \/tags now also contains geofence enabled flag, geofence radius and unique content identiefier for each tag.<\/p>\n<p>1.0.1.0<br \/>\nNew Feature: Tags can now be exported as csv.
