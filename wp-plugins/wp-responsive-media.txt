This isn\u2019t inherently a bad idea, but it does ruin the experience for your content editors who lose the ability to see images in the visual editor. WP Responsive Media maintains the visual editor support as well as all other WordPress media functionality. It\u2019s built on top of the Picturefill polyfill for the picture element and uses the default WordPress image sizes.A seamless responsive images solution for WordPress that doesn\u2019t break the visual editor.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Installing &#8220;WP Responsive Media&#8221; can be done either by searching for &#8220;WP Responsive Media&#8221; via the &#8220;Plugins &gt; Add New&#8221; screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin via WordPress.org<\/li>\n<li>Upload the ZIP file through the &#8216;Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload&#8217; screen in your WordPress dashboard<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"<h4>Does this make all of my images responsive for older posts?<\/h4>\n<p>No. This only works on images added after you\u2019ve activated the plugin.<\/p>\n<h4>Does everything blow up after I uninstall it?<\/h4>\n<p>No. There will be a little extra code in your markup that is used by this plugin, mainly some extra data attributes, but everything will continue to function normally.<\/p>\n<h4>Does this handle all media?<\/h4>\n<p>No. It only handles images. Someone had already taken WP Responsive Images so this was the next best.<\/p>\n<h4>How does it work?<\/h4>\n<p>After you\u2019ve activated the plugin, just go to your Post or Page and insert an image. You won\u2019t notice anything different in the WordPress admin, it\u2019ll just show up as an image like every other one. On the front end of the site, you\u2019ll now see that the images that you\u2019ve added are now fully responsive.
