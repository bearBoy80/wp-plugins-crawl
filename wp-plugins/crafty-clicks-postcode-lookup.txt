Postcode lookup speeds up form filling and boosts usability. Every address is verified at the point of entry. Problems due to incorrect or badly typed address data are drastically reduced.<\/p>\n<h4>Customer Satisfaction &amp; Conversions<\/h4>\n<p>Easier and faster checkout saves your customers&#8217; time, improves conversions and builds loyalty.<\/p>\n<h4>Data Quality<\/h4>\n<p>User input is validated in real time and your customer database is populated with fully verified addresses.
