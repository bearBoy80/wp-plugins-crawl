The Manage\/View Your Posts Only plugin is specially designed for those who have many authors or allow guest posts on their blogs. On WordPress, a contributor can write and submit a post and wait for review until it has been published. But while doing so, when they visit the &#8220;Posts&#8221; section, that lists all the posts, they are able to see posts by other contributors as well that are under review. While there may be no problem with that if all the authors are closely associated to the website or the company. However, if there are many guest writers contributing to a blog, many webmasters and site owners may not want every one of them view what others are posting and what posts are under review.<\/p>\n<p>The manage your posts plugin is a simple plugin that works out of the box. Simply install the plugin and you&#8217;re ready to roll. Once the plugin is installed, a contributor can only view the posts that they have submitted and cannot see what others have been submitting. The plugin also hides the total number of posts and post drafts present on the blog to the contributors.<\/p>\n<p>I wrote this plugin because I wanted this same exact feature on my blog and couldn&#8217;t find any plugin that could fix it easily.<\/p>\n<p>Plugin developed by <a href=\"http:\/\/zibeb.com\/\" title=\"Zibeb Tips and Reviews\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Zibeb Tips and Reviews<\/a><\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Will the Author and Administrator be able to view all the Contributor\u2019s posts?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry, The Administrator and the Authors have access to all the posts, only the contributors cannot view the posts submitted by the others<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Does this plugin conflict with any other plugins?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at all, it\u2019s a very simple plugin and there are no issues with other plugins so far.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">So incredibly happy this still works<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jh20001\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b3092b533c0980e369f43e3f6ccb605d?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b3092b533c0980e369f43e3f6ccb605d?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jh20001\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">jh20001<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 8, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">It is incredible that this still functions (for now).
