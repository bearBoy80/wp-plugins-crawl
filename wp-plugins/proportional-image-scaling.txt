Unfortunately, when the images&#8217; width is<br \/>\nlarger than the CSS &#8220;max-width&#8221; value, the width is capped but the height is not<br \/>\naffected, leading to distorted images.<br \/>\nThis plugin either removes all height and width tags from images of a given class<br \/>\n(resulting in a correct &#8220;max-width&#8221; behavior) or scales them to a given width to assist<br \/>\nbrowsers in creating the layout.<\/p>\n<h3>Known Limiations<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently, only pixel values are supported when scaling.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<p>Just drop the .php file into the plugins folder and activate it.<br \/>\nIt should work fine out of the box.<\/p>\n<h4>Configuration<\/h4>\n<p>By default, the plugin removes all &#8220;width&#8221; and &#8220;height&#8221; attributes from images, that<br \/>\ncontain the term &#8220;wp-image-&#8221; in their class.<\/p>\n<p>To enable proportional scaling, a width can be entered here. If this width is zero,<br \/>\nscaling is disabled and the attributes are removed.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, images can be selected by terms that appear in their class attribute.<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s a space separated list, so &#8220;wp-image- foo&#8221; will match against &#8220;wp-image-&#8221; and &#8220;foo&#8221;.<br \/>\nIf one of these terms is missing, the image is not processed.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Which width should I enter?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>When in doubt: 0.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Whats difference does it make when I enter a width?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you enter a value of 0, the width and height attribute are removed. While this<br \/>\nworks, it may be desirable to set these values in order to allow browsers to lay<br \/>\nout the page before the images are loaded. Setting a width and height allows the<br \/>\nplugin to scale these values so they fit int the design.<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s basically a setting for purists.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I exclude images?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, by their CSS class.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I disable the plugin on a per-post base?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, by adding <code>[disable_image_scaling]<\/code> anywhere in the post.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>After editing or changing my theme, the images are distorted again<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This might be due to the plugin&#8217;s configuration. If a target width larger than zero,<br \/>\nbut smaller than the (new) theme&#8217;s max-width value is set, the images will be scaled<br \/>\nto the given width. Then the max-width rule caps the width again, leading again to the<br \/>\ndistortion. This is normal behavior; Either set the target width to zero in the plugins&#8217;<br \/>\nsettings (this should be fail safe), or to the matching max-width value.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added class exclude setting<\/li>\n<li>Made the matching algorithm more robust to unexpected html.<\/li>\n<li>Added [disable_image_scaling] keyword support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/proportional-image-scaling\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1567302\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/proportional-image-scaling\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1567302\" alt=\"The settings menu.\"><\/a><p>The settings menu.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/proportional-image-scaling.1.1.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/proportional-image-scaling\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1567302","caption":"The settings menu."}},"tags":{"css":"css","images":"images","scaling":"scaling"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/proportional-image-scaling.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/proportional-image-scaling.1.1.zip","1.1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/proportional-image-scaling.1.1.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/proportional-image-scaling.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
