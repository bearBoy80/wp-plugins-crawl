The dedicated page I'm sure makes it easier for the css and other coding aspects, but makes usage inelegant overall.<br \/>\nI hope to see these items addressed very soon!<br \/>\nWith these concerns addressed - this plugin will be exactly what we want on all our sites!<\/p>\n<p>Ken\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/alt-calendar.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"calendar":"calendar","event":"Event","events":"events","google-calendar":"google calendar","organizer":"organizer","schedule":"schedule"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
