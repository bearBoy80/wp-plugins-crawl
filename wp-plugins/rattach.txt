The attached files section will display on posts as soon as the plugin is activated.<\/p>\n<h4>Options<\/h4>\n<p>There is a single option added to the Writing settings page, and it is whether rAttach displays the attached files by default.<\/p>\n<p>If you typically will not want to display attachments, but may occasionally, you will want to clear the checkbox and click save.  If you want attachments displayed on most or all posts the checkbox should stay checked.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, you can override the option.  Adding a custom field named rAttach-on with a value of anything other than empty or a zero will display attachments regardless of the option setting.  Likewise, rAttach-off with any non-blank, non-zero value will force the page to not display attached files.<\/p>\n","faq":"<p>Nada&#8230;<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Just changing the home page for my plugins, so no changes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/rattach\/trunk\/screenshot-1.gif?rev=1444304\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/rattach\/trunk\/screenshot-1.gif?rev=1444304\" alt=\"Example showing 2 files attached to a post\"><\/a><p>Example showing 2 files attached to a post<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/rattach\/trunk\/screenshot-2.gif?rev=1444304\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/rattach\/trunk\/screenshot-2.gif?rev=1444304\" alt=\"Clip of the settings page\"><\/a><p>Clip of the settings page<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/rattach\/trunk\/screenshot-3.gif?rev=1444304\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/rattach\/trunk\/screenshot-3.gif?rev=1444304\" alt=\"Custom fields\"><\/a><p>Custom fields<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/rattach.0.1.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/rattach\/trunk\/screenshot-1.gif?rev=1444304","caption":"Example showing 2 files attached to a post"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/rattach\/trunk\/screenshot-2.gif?rev=1444304","caption":"Clip of the settings page"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/rattach\/trunk\/screenshot-3.gif?rev=1444304","caption":"Custom fields"}},"tags":{"attachment":"attachment","attachments":"attachments","image":"image","images":"images","post":"post","posts":"posts"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/rattach.0.1.zip","0.1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/rattach.0.1.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/rattach.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
