The biggest problem was getting one of the forms to allow customers to upload images with their reviews. Apparently, there are about 3 or 4 places (it might be only 3, but I think it was 4) where I had to check a box to allow uploads. They might each have been for different areas. I think some are a requirement of WooCommerce, and some for this plug-in.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">In any event, there is one remaining problem that did not get resolved, which support has given me a workaround for.

As I said, once they started, they were on top of things, and kept in contact. It\u2019s only 4 stars, though, because I feel like it should be easier to work \u201cout of the box,\u201d and because some of the documentation seems dated.
