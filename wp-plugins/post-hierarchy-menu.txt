I needed a simple way to show them in a nested list that reflected their hierarchy.  So I wrote this plugin to do just that.<\/p>\n<p>Once installed it addes a widget that will allow you to select which post type to display.  It&#8217;s generally handy if you have hierarchical custom post types or a lot of deeply nested pages.  On the front end, this adds a script to load in the post list asyncrously &#8211; this lets your website load first without having to worry about pulling together the list of all your posts.  Onec the site is loaded, then all the posts will load.  Another resource saver for you &#8211; the posts are organised into their hierarchical order client side.  This means the server just spits out an array of posts and sends them to the visitor&#8217;s browser.  Once they arrive the visitors browser will do the work of orgaisaiton.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>The usual &#8211; FTP the files into <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> then activate in the admin.<br \/>\nOr &#8211; search &#8216;post hierarchy menu&#8217; in the add plugins secrion, install and activate.<\/p>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s intalled, go to apperance -&gt; widgets and you should see a fancy new widget sitting there ready for you to use!<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the first version &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t do much in terms of customisation, yet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">I made it<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ijmccallum\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/89e5c797fbce4703fa73c1df3d7041a9?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/89e5c797fbce4703fa73c1df3d7041a9?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ijmccallum\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">ijmccallum<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>So of course I think it's amazing!\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/post-hierarchy-menu.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"custom-post-types":"custom post types","hierarchy":"hierarchy","menu":"menu"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/post-hierarchy-menu.0.1.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/iainjmccallum.com\/","banners":[]}
