It&#8217;s a one way, one time operation and after that the posts are not connected or synced in any way.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on your WordPress setup, post attachments and featured images may or may not work in the target sites. Please read next to get a shared media library support for your multisite system.<\/p>\n<h3>Please Note<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin works best alongside <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bueltge\/multisite-global-media\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Multisite Global Media<\/a> plugin. If both plugins are installed, all attachments and featured images are properly linked in the target site. The actual files stay in one place and don&#8217;t get cloned saving your disk space. This is an optimal setup in most situations.<\/p>\n<h3>Need more features?<\/h3>\n<p>This is a basic proof of concept plugin, please let me know if you want to see more features.
