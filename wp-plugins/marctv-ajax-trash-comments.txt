When this plugin delivered what it promised, I could not believe it because my disappointment with the other three.  This function should have been part of WP code, but good luck with that.  We have more than 43K plugins in the repository and I was stunned when I was not able to find a plugin that does this seemingly necessary use case.  This plugin has exceeded my expectation actually by providing one-click easy replacement of abusive comment with pre-authored comment, for example \"[Comment made invisible due to violation of community standard]\" in addition to sending email to admin when user report comment and allowing admins to trash, replace, approve\/override reports, report right at the front end (of course these available in dedicated admin page as well.)\n\nThis plugin focuses in comment reporting to help admins deal with abusive users' comments making admins' lives easier and does it well.      <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Well, at least it works<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"3 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"3\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tneveu\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/819dd8360f39efe371d619ae6eca888d?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/819dd8360f39efe371d619ae6eca888d?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tneveu\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Boston Tom <small>(tneveu)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>I've tried every plugin out there to flag comments and this is the only one that showed up on the frontend. <strong>Unfortunately, it doesn't send the admin an email when a comment has been flagged by another user.<\/strong> Or set a threshold before the comment is removed altogether until the admin can review the contents. For example, if two people flag the same comment, it should automatically go into moderation and therefore can't be seen by other people. That's useful if you are away and don't have access to your site's administrative backend. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Not emailing the admin is it's biggest downfall.<\/strong> I honestly don't know why WP wouldn't have flagging comments as an option for its lauded commenting system. Anyways, if the developer is reading this, please add in this functionality as an option and\/or a way to quickly moderate via email using links (as an example):<\/p>\n<p><strong>Quick moderation:<\/strong> <a href=\"#\">Unpublish<\/a> | <a href=\"#\">Mark as OK<\/a> | <a href=\"#\">Trash<\/a> | <a href=\"#\">Ban IP<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>If it did any of the above or even just emailed the site admin, I'd give it ten stars and ten dollars. <\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.2.2.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments\/assets\/screenshot-1.gif?rev=2789620","caption":"The plugin in action."}},"tags":{"admin":"admin","ajax":"ajax","comments":"comments","flag":"flag","report":"report"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.0.3.zip","1.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.1.0.zip","1.1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.1.1.zip","1.1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.1.2.zip","1.1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.1.3.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.2.zip","1.2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.2.1.zip","1.2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.2.2.zip","1.2.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.2.3.zip","1.2.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.2.4.zip","1.2.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.2.5.zip","1.2.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.2.6.zip","1.2.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.2.7.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.3.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.4.zip","1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.5.zip","1.9":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.1.9.zip","2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.2.0.zip","2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.2.1.zip","2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.2.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2789620","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/marctv-ajax-trash-comments\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=2789620"}}
