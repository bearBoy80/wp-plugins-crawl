Those that want to make them better, more flexible, more attractive and be using WordPress for comments.<\/p>\n<p>As such as falling into that category myself I have installed a number of plugins to achieve this.  Comment Luv and now this one My Comment Authors.  This appears to be very light weight and works exceptionally well for what it is designed for, to track and reward good commentators with a serious mention.  This is effective and has sent a number of people to my blog in a matter of days from another blogger using it.  This is before even having the effect of people seeing themselves rewarded on my blog.<\/p>\n<p>It will encourage commenters like comment luv does also.  It will also take work to turn those commenters into a real network instead of simply a place to try to get a link or mention.  This is the effect of fully login able comment sections, whether it is WordPress default, or heavily enhanced.  Build it and they will come.  The better it is built the more will come and you have both the benefits and the maintenance of what comes realizes they need to be quality also.<\/p>\n<p>But this little plugin is great for those that realize the true value of good comment sections and want to make them better, ultimately attracting more real readers, commenters and mentions.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mycommentauthors.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mycommentauthors\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=962869","caption":"MyCommentAuthors HTML list source code.
