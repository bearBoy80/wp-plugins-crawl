I've used a bunch of the big name membership plugins for WordPress, and I have to say that this was the easiest to set and get started with. It's perfect for our simple company needs!\n\nThe only thing it's missing is PayPal integration so that we can take signups on the frontend of our websites if we decide to use this for some of our other membership projects. Right now it seems to only have a shortcode for putting a simple registration form on the frontend but for free memberships only. Hoping they'll build something for taking payments soon!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/elearning-memberships.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"ecourse":"ecourse","elearning":"elearning","lms":"lms","membership":"membership","memberships":"memberships"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/elearning-memberships.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/elearning-memberships.1.1.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
