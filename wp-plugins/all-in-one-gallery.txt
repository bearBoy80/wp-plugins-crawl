So the plugin is simply looking at all the categories and pages, then check if there are images in all the category&#8217;s posts (or pages) and, if there are, use the [ gallery ] shortcode to display the images.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin should work and fit with every themes as it&#8217;s using the original wordpress gallery markup. Every themes normally have style this feature as you use the gallery shortcode in pages or posts.<\/p>\n<p>There is a &#8216;exclude images&#8217; features that let you select images that should be display in the Gallery page. But do to a wordpress bug in 2.9.1 with the include\/exclude feature, this feature as been disable. It&#8217;s shame as the feature is pretty cool and easy to use. Maybe with the 2.9.2.<\/p>\n<p>All-in-One-Gallery plugin work with the new [ gallery ] shortcode and therefor will only work with wordpress version older then 2.5.

Some people requested some features trough my website, like pagination, exlude images or don&#8217;t display categories without images and they did end up being implemented in the version 2.1. So any comments are welcomed.<\/p>\n<p>The [ gallery ] shortcode only works with images you have uploaded with wordpress (starting with version 2.6 maybe 2.5). So if the gallery doesn&#8217;t display images from older posts the problem seems to come from wordpress.<\/p>\n<p>Adding your Own Style:<\/p>\n<p>There is two way to do this, the easiest and recommended way is to use the &#8216;no style&#8217; option and manage that in your main stylesheet. If for some reason you don&#8217;t want to do this:<br \/>\n1. Copy one of the folder in the themes folder ( plugins-&gt;all-in-one-gallery-&gt;all_in_one_gallery_themes )<br \/>\n2. Rename the folder and rename the css file inside with exactly the same name. ex: If the folder name is &#8216;my-design-is-better&#8217;, the css file name has to be &#8216;my-design-is-better.css&#8217;<br \/>\n3. Edit the css file like you want to.<br \/>\n4. Upload your folder on your website in  plugins-&gt;all-in-one-gallery-&gt;themes<br \/>\n5. Go to Pages-&gt;All in One Gallery in your Dashboard and select your design from the the dropdown menu.<br \/>\nnote: the style in the themes folder only affect the &#8216;all in one gallery&#8217; menu, the [gallery] design is up to your website Theme.<br \/>\nwarning: make a copy of your style before updating the plugin<\/p>\n","changelog":"<p>v2.1:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Move the options to the Pages menu with capabilities set to Author, Editor and Admin.<\/li>\n<li>Little changes in the CSS ( navigation and h3).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>v2.0:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable &#8220;Exclude Images from gallery&#8221; until wordpress&#8217; exlude\/include gallery feature is fixed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>v1.9:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exclude Images from gallery (only works with 2.9 and higher)<\/li>\n<li>Pagination (thanks Karl).<\/li>\n<li>Updated functions, var, names, etc to be unique to All-in-one-gallery.<\/li>\n<li>Options: Don&#8217;t display categories without images in the gallery.<\/li>\n<li>Options: Added a &#8216;no-style&#8217; stylesheet to make it easier if you want to manage style from your theme css file.<\/li>\n<li>Jquery for instant update of the tick boxes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>v1.0:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple style for the menu ( green, blue, grey and pink )<\/li>\n<li>Possibility to add user&#8217;s own style ( see faqs )<\/li>\n<li>Welcome message on\/off, if OFF display user&#8217;s category choice<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>v0.7:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Now the All-in-one-Gallery also display images from Pages.<\/li>\n<li>Pages are treated in a group like if &#8216;Pages&#8217; was a Category<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>v0.6.1:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minors fixed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>v0.6:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed css and php minor problems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>v0.5:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added possibility to change the welcome message.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>v0.4:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>first released.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/all-in-one-gallery\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1566849\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/all-in-one-gallery\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1566849\" alt=\"Setting pannel for All in one Gallery plugin.\"><\/a><p>Setting pannel for All in one Gallery plugin.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-gallery.2.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/all-in-one-gallery\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1566849","caption":"Setting pannel for All in one Gallery plugin."}},"tags":{"gallery":"gallery","images":"images","simple":"simple"},"versions":{"0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-gallery.0.4.zip","0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-gallery.0.5.zip","0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-gallery.0.6.zip","0.6.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-gallery.0.6.1.zip","0.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-gallery.0.7.zip","1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-gallery.1.0.zip","1.9":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-gallery.1.9.zip","2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-gallery.2.0.zip","2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-gallery.2.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-gallery.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/fuck-dance-lets-art.com","banners":[]}
