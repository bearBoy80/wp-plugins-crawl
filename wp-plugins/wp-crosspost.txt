It can import your reblogs and other posts on WordPress.com. It even downloads the media attachments in your WordPress.com posts and saves them in your self-hosted WordPress Media Library.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transform your self-hosted WordPress website into a back-end for your WordPress.com-hosted website. Create original posts on your local computer, but publish them to WordPress.com.

Private WordPress posts stay private on the remote site, deleting a post from WordPress that you&#8217;ve previously cross-posted deletes it from the remote site, too, and so on. Scheduling a WordPress post to be published any time in the future will add it to the remote site&#8217;s future publication schedule, too. See the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-crosspost\/other_notes\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Other Notes<\/a> page for a complete listing of features.<\/p>\n<p>WP-Crosspost is very lightweight. It just requires you to connect to your WordPress.com account from the plugin options screen. After that, you&#8217;re ready to cross-post!<\/p>\n<p>Other options and features enable tweaking additional metadata from your WordPress entry (notably categories and tags) to the remote site, switching comments and pingbacks on or off, and more.<\/p>\n<p>WP-Crosspost transforms your self-hosted WordPress website into a back-end for your WordPress.com-hosted website. Create your posts locally on your own computer&#8217;s WordPress, but publish to WordPress.com&#8217;s servers. This means you&#8217;ll always have a portable copy of your entire blog, and you can stop worrying about whether your backups are up to date. Create new content locally, then move them to the server automatically, instead of the other way around!<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Servers no longer serve, they possess.

Your mileage may vary, but for me, it generated between 150 and 200 junk copies of posts I had already made. <\/p>\n<p>It's remarkably bad. Not just the usual unfinished bad, but intentionally dangerous, and misleading bad.<\/p>\n<p>Meitar, was considerate and well mannered when I contacted him about the issue on Github. He called me crazy for thinking their was a problem, called me an idiot no less than three times; and then, he offered some truly amusing unsolicited professional advice.<\/p>\n<p>The term, \"jumping down your throat,\" doesn't really cut it here. Maitar has some truly unresolved daddy issues that really show through both in his work, and conversations.<\/p>\n<p>When I attempted to follow up, and commend him on his comedy, I found myself blocked.<\/p>\n<p>Expect similar results if you're in the mood for earnestly reporting a problem to this character. He's very thin skinned, and will not stand for anything but a pat on the head for a job well done. After viewing his Github profile, where he's selling his own brand of troll politics for unknown reasons, it's not hard to understand why.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin is not designed to work.<\/p>\n<p>It's designed for the trollish amusement of its author. He likes screwing up people's sites. It's what he's doing.

I did a thorough search, and right now, this is the only available option I could find (some other plugins which used to do this are no longer supported).<\/p>\n<p>I was looking for something that would cross post from one self-hosted blog to another.  Cross Post will do this if the destination blog is attached to WordPress.com via Jet Pack, and the JSON API is enabled.  There are explicit instructions on how to set this up in the Forum, and if you follow them, it's fairly straight forward.<\/p>\n<p>That said, after a thorough investigation, I decided I couldn't use Cross Post.  The basic problem is that my sites all use featured images, and all use custom fields.  Cross-posting a post without that information is next to useless for me, and that's what happens.  That was the killer.<\/p>\n<p>Another issue, which I could have worked around, but was annoying, is the inflexibility of automatic cross posting.  I was looking to cross post posts from a city-wide database to another site that focused on a particular neighborhood.  Cross Post uses only Categories to decide whether to ignore or cross post something.  Given the way my taxonomy was set up, there was no convenient way to manage this.  It needs to allow cross posting by tags, or by a custom taxonomy, as well as categories.  Right now, it appears the category selection can only block whether a post gets cross posted.  There needs to be an affirmative option, such as \"only post if it's tagged 'crosspost'\".<\/p>\n<p>If you use basic Posts without additional custom data, this is potentially a very useful plugin.  If you use custom fields, taxonomies, and featured images, it's probably too limited.<\/p>\n<p>I hope the developer continues to enhance this product, because I'd love to be able to use it.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-crosspost.0.4.2.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-crosspost\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2304617","caption":"<p>When you first install WP-Crosspost, you'll need to connect it to your WordPress.com account before you can start crossposting.
