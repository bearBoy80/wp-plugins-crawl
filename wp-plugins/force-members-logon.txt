This add-on displays the standard WordPress logon page if user who has not already logged on attempts to access a protected page or post. This allows the Members plugin to check the users roles against the required roles for the post\/page. User is redirected to page\/post after logon and will either see the page\/post or the error message defined in the Members plugin (if they don&#8217;t have a required role).<\/p>\n<h3>Usage<\/h3>\n<p>Requires Members plugin to be activated.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin to your WordPress installation<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"<ol>\n<li>I get an error &#8216;You don&#8217;t have permission to access \/wp-login.php on this server&#8217;<br \/>\nThe WordPress logon redirect function adds the URL of the page after the logon screen as a query string parameter.
