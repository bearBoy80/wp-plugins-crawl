Users copy the video or playlist embed url into this new block.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin embeds an iframe onto the page, even if the user does not have the capability to embed raw iframes. Using server-side rendering along with server-side validation, it embeds iframes to any subdomain of panopto.com. It also verifies that the url path points to a video or playlist.<\/p>\n<h3>Third Party Notice<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin relies on the services provided by Panopto.com. Anytime the plugin is used to embed a video from Panopto, their embed code is loaded onto your page. Any analytics, tracking, or other code loaded in the iframe is controlled by Panopto, not the developer of this plugin.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Panopto: https:\/\/www.panopto.com\/<\/li>\n<li>Panopto terms of service: https:\/\/www.panopto.com\/terms-of-service\/<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin to <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/embed-panopto<\/code>, or install through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Why do I need this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you want to embed a Panopto video onto your page, your user normally needs to have iframe permissions. In a larger site where a user isn\\&#8217;t an admin, they likely do not have the ability to embed an iframe.<\/p>\n<p>This block gives standard users a simple way to embed a video or playlist from Panopto without requiring that they be given potentially dangerous permissions. The plugin verifies the url the user enters and ensures that only subdomains of panopto.com are rendered into iframes.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can the html be formatted?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not within the block itself. The iframe is generated within a div and a class <code>panopto-video<\/code>, so you may use css rules to format it. But if you have multiple panopto videos embedded on a single page, they would need other wrappers to differentiate the rules.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<p>2.2.1<br \/>\n* Added readme, screenshots, gpl license details<\/p>\n<p>2.2.0<br \/>\n* Renamed to meet WordPress naming guidelines<\/p>\n<p>2.1.0<br \/>\n* First public release<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-panopto\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2240225\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-panopto\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2240225\" alt=\"Block editor - Editor interface before embedding a video\"><\/a><p>Block editor - Editor interface before embedding a video<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-panopto\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2240225\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-panopto\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2240225\" alt=\"Block editor - Editor interface after embedding a video\"><\/a><p>Block editor - Editor interface after embedding a video<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-panopto\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2240225\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-panopto\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2240225\" alt=\"Block output - Output render of block on a page\"><\/a><p>Block output - Output render of block on a page<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-panopto\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2240225\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-panopto\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2240225\" alt=\"Block search - Name of the block when adding to a page\"><\/a><p>Block search - Name of the block when adding to a page<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/embed-panopto.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-panopto\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2240225","caption":"Block editor - Editor interface before embedding a video"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-panopto\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2240225","caption":"Block editor - Editor interface after embedding a video"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-panopto\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2240225","caption":"Block output - Output render of block on a page"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-panopto\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2240225","caption":"Block search - Name of the block when adding to a page"}},"tags":{"block":"block","embed":"embed","gutenberg":"gutenberg","panopto":"panopto","video":"video"},"versions":{"2.2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/embed-panopto.2.2.1.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
