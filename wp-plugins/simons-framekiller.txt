A frame is a subdivision of a Web browser window and can act like a smaller window. A framekiller is usually used to prevent a website from being loaded from within a frameset without permission or as an attack, as with clickjacking.<\/p>\n<p>See:<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Framekiller<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/simons-framekiller.0.1.0.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"frame":"frame","iframe":"iframe","security":"security"},"versions":{"0.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/simons-framekiller.0.1.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/simons-framekiller.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
