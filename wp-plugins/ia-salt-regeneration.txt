Please install and activate IA first before using this plugin!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>IA is a wonderful solution for GDPR compliant visitor tracking. However, some data protection authorities in the EU consider it necessary to &#8220;forget&#8221; visitors to a website as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>This is where our solution comes into play. Our addon ensures that IA generates a new Visitor Token Salt every day at midnight. This is used by IA to calculate a unique key for each visitor.<\/p>\n<p>Without our solution, IA will continue to recognize a returning visitor until something significant changes (such as the IP address). With IA Salt Regeneration, this no longer happens and you can truly use IA in a 100% GDPR compliant way.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>The easiest way to install IA Salt Regeneration is by visiting your <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New<\/strong> menu. Search for &#8220;IA Salt Regeneration&#8221; and install the first result you see there.<\/p>\n<p>To install with the zip file downloaded from this page:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Login to your WordPress dashboard<\/li>\n<li>Visit the <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New<\/strong> menu<\/li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Upload Plugin<\/strong> button at the top<\/li>\n<li>In the upload form that appears, click the <strong>Choose file<\/strong> button and select the <strong>ia-salt-regeneration.zip<\/strong> file you downloaded here<\/li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Install Now<\/strong> button<\/li>\n<li>Once the page reloads, click the blue <strong>Activate<\/strong> link<\/li>\n<li>Done.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20include%20a%20cookie%20consent%20when%20i%20install%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nDo I need to include a cookie consent when I install this plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. But you should already have included a notice about the use of Independent Analytics in your privacy policy. You do not need to explicitly mention IA Salt Regeneration. A reference to the fact that the Visitor Token Salt is regenerated daily and what (positive) effects this has on the visitor data is recommended.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20set%20when%20and%20how%20often%20the%20visitor%20token%20salt%20should%20be%20regenerated%3F'>\nCan I set when and how often the Visitor Token Salt should be regenerated?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, at the moment there is no possibility for that. But if there is an increased demand for it, we will consider this in a future version.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20know%20that%20a%20new%20visitor%20token%20salt%20has%20actually%20been%20generated%3F'>\nHow do I know that a new Visitor Token Salt has actually been generated?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>At the moment we have not implemented a convenient function for this yet. But you can do the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Call <code>\/wp-admin\/options.php<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Search for <code>iawp_salt<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Save the value from the input field.<\/li>\n<li>Wait a day or at least until midnight.<\/li>\n<li>Repeat step 1-3 and compare the two values.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Do the two values differ? Great, then everything worked!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.2 &amp; 1.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Salt regeneration does not work with the Pro version.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Action Scheduler does not load.<\/li>\n<li>Tested up to WordPress version 6.4.1<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ia-salt-regeneration\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2987970\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ia-salt-regeneration\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2987970\" alt=\"Hook to update the visitor token salt in the Action Scheduler (Tools -&gt; Scheduled Actions).\"><\/a><p>Hook to update the visitor token salt in the Action Scheduler (Tools -&gt; Scheduled Actions).<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ia-salt-regeneration.1.0.3.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ia-salt-regeneration\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2987970","caption":"Hook to update the visitor token salt in the Action Scheduler (Tools -&gt; Scheduled Actions)."}},"tags":{"analytics":"analytics","analytics-dashboard":"Analytics dashboard","google-analytics":"google analytics","statistics":"statistics","wordpress-analytics":"WordPress analytics"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ia-salt-regeneration.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ia-salt-regeneration.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ia-salt-regeneration.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ia-salt-regeneration.1.0.3.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ia-salt-regeneration.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ia-salt-regeneration\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2987970","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ia-salt-regeneration\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2987970"}}
