Get the Image offers something for everybody. Much of the reason for its success is because it uses standard WordPress code and methods for doing what it needs to do, which is to simply grab images.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin was designed to make the process of adding thumbnail, featured, slider, gallery, and other images to your blog much easier, but it&#8217;s so much more than that.  It is an image-based representation of your WordPress posts.<\/p>\n<p>This is a highly intuitive script that can grab an image by custom field input, WordPress&#8217; featured image, post attachment, or extracting it from the post&#8217;s content.  Plus, a lot more!<\/p>\n<h3>Before using<\/h3>\n<p>Please note that Get the Image requires that you understand and know how to edit your theme&#8217;s PHP code, at least to the extent of copying and pasting one line of code.  If you&#8217;re not comfortable doing this, it&#8217;s best to ask that your theme author integrate the code necessary to support this plugin.<\/p>\n<h3>A little history<\/h3>\n<p>The original plugin was in launched 2008, which means it has several years of solid testing and development behind it.  It was created at a time when WordPress had very little native media support.  At the time, it was mostly used as a &#8220;thumbnail&#8221; script for magazine-\/news-style sites.  But, it has grown into a much more flexible script over the years.<\/p>\n<p>Even with WordPress&#8217; more recent advancements in image management, many users still continue using this plugin because it offers a more robust image script than core WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin has been downloaded 100,000s of times and is used on millions of sites as part of WordPress theme packages.<\/p>\n<p>Other image plugins have come and gone, but Get the Image has stood the test of time with several years of successful installs and happy users.<\/p>\n<h3>Professional support<\/h3>\n<p>If you need professional plugin support from me, the plugin author, you can join the club at <a href=\"https:\/\/themehybrid.com\/club\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Theme Hybrid<\/a>, which is a professional WordPress help\/support site where I handle support for all my plugins and themes for a community of 75,000+ users (and growing).<\/p>\n<h3>Plugin Development<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a theme author, plugin author, or just a code hobbyist, you can follow the development of this plugin on its <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/justintadlock\/get-the-image\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Donations<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, I do accept donations.  If you want to donate, you can do so from my <a href=\"https:\/\/themehybrid.com\/donate\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">donations page<\/a> or grab me something from my <a href=\"http:\/\/a.co\/flUb0ns\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Amazon Wish List<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I appreciate all donations, no matter the size.  Further development of this plugin is not contingent on donations, but they are always a nice incentive.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Why was this plugin created?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It was originally created to work with magazine\/news themes.  These types of themes typically required a lot of work when inputting images to make them look good.  This plugin was developed to make that process much easier for the end user.  But, at the same time, it needed to be flexible enough to handle anything.<\/p>\n<p>However, over the years, it has grown to be one of the most robust image scripts for WordPress.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How does it grab images?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Looks for an image by custom field (one of your choosing).<\/li>\n<li>If no image is added by custom field, check for a featured image.<\/li>\n<li>If no image is found, it grabs an image attached to your post.<\/li>\n<li>If no image is attached, it can extract an image from your post content (off by default).<\/li>\n<li>If no image is found at this point, it will fall back to a default image (not set by default).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I add it to my theme?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are several methods, but in general, you would use this call within The Loop.<\/p>\n<pre><code>`\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>\n    `<\/p>\n<p>To see all methods and options, refer to the <code>readme.md<\/code> file included with the plugin download or <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/justintadlock\/breadcrumb-trail\/blob\/master\/readme.md\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">view the readme online<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<p>Please see the <code>changelog.md<\/code> file included with the plugin file.

Lots of sites do not use Featured Image and prefer to add images into the editor, especially very old sites and blogs.

Don't use this plugin unless you know where to put your hands in the core. The plugin offer absolutely no settings, neither a checkbox or anything in the backend (where the game should occur), you almost think it's not installed. The instructions on Github are only clear to WP developers and so vague that not even studying WP documentation you can understand where to put the functions.\nLucky those 50K who are succesfully using it, they must all be developers. Myself, I canned it!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Just works<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tanng\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/84e3f36fe7801fd9390d7b6af6d0f753?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/84e3f36fe7801fd9390d7b6af6d0f753?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tanng\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Tan Nguyen <small>(tanng)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>Nice plugin, I use it for all of my sites.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.1.1.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/get-the-image\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1776618","caption":"Slider plus thumbnails."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/get-the-image\/trunk\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1776618","caption":"Portfolio images."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/get-the-image\/trunk\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=1776618","caption":"Gallery-style thumbnails."}},"tags":{"image":"image","images":"images","thumbnail":"thumbnail"},"versions":{"0.3.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.0.3.1.zip","0.3.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.0.3.2.zip","0.3.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.0.3.3.zip","0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.0.4.zip","0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.0.5.zip","0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.0.6.zip","0.6.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.0.6.1.zip","0.6.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.0.6.2.zip","0.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.0.7.zip","0.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.0.8.zip","0.8.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.0.8.1.zip","0.9.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.0.9.0.zip","1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.1.0.1.zip","1.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.1.1.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/get-the-image.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/themehybrid.com\/donate","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/get-the-image\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1735614","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/get-the-image\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1735614"}}
