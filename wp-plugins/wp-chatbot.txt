Users can start chatting on any page of your website. The chat is persistent, meaning that if they start a Messenger chat from your website, that chat thread is also available on their mobile device or the desktop version of Facebook Messenger. Chats don\u2019t end when a user leaves your website. They\u2019ve just begun.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is that all?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. That\u2019s the main purpose of the WP-Chatbot. By using MobileMonkey, a chatbot builder, you can engage with the user long after their first interaction. Using advanced Facebook Messenger chatbots (easy to make, with no coding involved), you can send drip campaigns, segment users, send chat blasts, and more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What if no one is available to answer a user\u2019s chat?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Instead of relying on live support to answer chats, you can set up a chatbot that dialogues with customers using natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), or you can create a custom sequence that guides users through various menus and options to get exactly what they need. If you want, you can also set a message that informs users when they should check back for a live chat with a real person.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will WP-Chatbot work with any WordPress website?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, WP-Chatbot is designed to work with any website built on WordPress v. 4.6 or higher. It has been tested up to WordPress version 5.5.1.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What else do I need in order to start using WP-Chatbot?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you start using WP-Chatbot, you should have the following:<br \/>\n&#8211; A Facebook Business Page<br \/>\n&#8211; Your Facebook Page ID<br \/>\nIn the setup process, you\u2019ll also need to add your website to the whitelisted pages section within Facebook.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is WP-Chatbot compliant with GDPR?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. Consent, a requisite component of GDPR, takes place when the user clicks the button to \u201ccontinue as [name].\u201d It\u2019s important that any chatbot dialogues you create should inform subscribers how they can unsubscribe at any time. For example, you can tell users \u201cJust type STOP at any time to unsubscribe.\u201d If you are using MobileMonkey, then MobileMonkey will automatically handle the unsubscribe request. If the contact wishes to have their data deleted from MobileMonkey, they can always send a message via Messenger or via email to make the request,. Once the page owner receives the deletion request, they can easily honor the request by using the delete contact action in MobileMokey.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does WP-Chatbot come with any analytics?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you have a Facebook Developer account, you can view WP-Chatbot analytics if desired. If you do not have a Facebook Developer account, you can easily create one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can WP-Chatbot increase leads?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. In fact, that\u2019s the main reason that most website creators and marketers add the plugin. It is a powerful way to grow an active and engaged contact list from your website traffic. Rather than visitors simply stopping in and checking out your site, they are intentionally engaging with your brand in a way that secures them a spot on your contact list.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will the WP-Chatbot plugin also improve conversions?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The answer is most likely yes, but it just depends on the nature of your business, what you consider a conversion, and other factors. Data indicates that users who are able to live chat with a business are worth 4.5 times as customers who don\u2019t chat, and their average order size is 10% larger than non-chatting users.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is the WP-Chatbot just for customer support?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The WP-Chatbot is, of course, a marvelous customer support tool, but it has many other uses in marketing. Most users of WP-Chatbot are also MobileMonkey users.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does the chat process work from a user perspective?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The widget is usually persistently positioned at the lower corner of a website. You can customize the greeting message. One popular greeting is \u201cHi! How can we help you?\u201d If the user is logged in, they will click the button that reads \u201cContinue as [Name].\u201d Instantly, they receive a message with an invitation to continue the conversation. They can continue with the chat on the website, or in the case that they are a Facebook Messenger user, they can use the Facebook Messenger app to continue.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who owns WP-Chatbot?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WP-Chatbot is owned by MobileMonkey, a chat marketing app and chatbot builder that creates chatbots for Facebook Messenger, native web chat, SMS and more. LarryKim, the founder of MobileMonkey is a three-time winner of the most influential PPC marketer, a number one columnist on Search Engine Land and Search Engine Journal.

In fact, you can even create advanced and high-impact chatbot sequences on MobileMonkey without any coding.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is the chat history deleted or can I save them?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All chats are automatically stored in your MobileMonkey inbox (in the web app or mobile app), where they are stored indefinitely or until a user unsubscribes from your list. There\u2019s no need to manually save chats. The user also retains a persistent record of their chat history with you if the chat is conducted in Facebook Messenger.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can I see information about contacts who opt-in to the chat?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If they&#8217;re chatting with you through Facebook Messenger, yes. In fact, when a visitor on your site chats with you as a logged in Facebook Messenger user, you can see their name as well as a good deal of information that they have chosen to share publicly on their Facebook profile. This may include their language, where they&#8217;re located, and more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can anyone on your business\u2019s support team or customer service team chat with users?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. Anyone who has a page role on your Business Page (Admin, Editor, Moderator) can chat.

If the user is already logged into Facebook or Facebook Messenger on their browser or mobile device, the widget can display the button message \u201cContinue as [Name].\u201d If the user is not logged in to Facebook Messenger, the button will greet the visitor as you tell it to for native web chat users.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does WP-Chatbot provide support?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. WP-Chatbot has a large support forum with fast response and top-rated support.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is WP-Chatbot similar to ManyChat?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>ManyChat is a chatbot builder, but is not a WordPress plugin. WP-Chatbot makes it easy for website visitors to chat with you on Facebook Messenger as well as outside of Messenger, which is really handy because not every site visitor is logged into Facebook. For maximum chatbot power, WP-Chatbot seamlessly integrates with MobileMonkey, a robust and full-featured chatbot builder. MobileMonkey is where you can harness the full power of chat marketing, creating drip sequences, lead magnets, chat blasts, and more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How is WP-Chatbot different from other WordPress chatbot plugins?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Many plugins simply open a link to a Facebook page. WP-Chatbot integrates the chat on your website with no new tabs or links being required to continue the chat. Another distinguishing feature is WP-Chatbot\u2019s ease of use. Installing the plugin to your site and connecting it to your Facebook Business page is simple and requires only a few minutes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How is WP-Chatbot different from Tidio Live Chat?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Tidio Live Chat is a great chatbot for communicating with customers on your website. it is not connected with Facebook or Facebook Messenger. WP-Chatbot has the same chat functionality as Tidio Live Chat, allows businesses to connect with customers using  Messenger as the messaging platform. This has lead generation benefits as customers can receive follow-up messaging from the business. And customers are likely to use Messenger as a chat forum because it\u2019s safe and familiar. Tidio is a fitting WordPress chabot plugin if you don\u2019t want to integrate with Facebook Messenger.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is WP-Chatbot similar to Collect.chat?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Collect.chat is a chatbot plugin that allows you to chat with customers on your website. Like other chatbots including Tidio, Collect.chat is a native chat application without integration to Facebook Messenger. While Colllect.chat provides useful chat functionality, it is limited in what it can offer for retaining chat users for. WP-Chatbot features native website chat and Facebook Messenger chat at the same time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does WP-Chatbot have the same level of power as the IBM Watson Assistant?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>IBM Watson is a chatbot plugin that uses IBM\u2019s data and information to create an intelligent chatbot. It is not a website widget chatbot, so it\u2019s not possible to continue marketing to chatbot users on Facebook. Additionally, in order to gain the full functionality of IBM Watson, it is necessary to purchase IBM Cloud usage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are there are WordPress chatbot plugins that are similar to WP-Chatbot?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are currently dozens of WordPress chatbot plugins including Cliengo, Clientity, Acobot, My Chatbot, HubSpot, Instabot, Chatbot Botnation, Chatfuel, ArtiBot, Bot Libre, GoBot, and Botsify. Most of these chatbots do not integrate with Facebook Messenger. And not one of them offers OmniChat\u2122, the patent-pending technology that makes one chat marketing flow work in multiple messaging apps. Alternative WordPress chatbot plugins typically offer a single limited feature, for example, to improve an onsite shopping experience or to send newsletters.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does WP-Chatbot work in other countries or with other languages?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, WP-Chatbot supports all Facebook languages, which is currently 142 different languages.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does WP-Chatbot work in real time?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, WP-Chatbot transmits messages in real time within Facebook Messenger as well as native web chat.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What industries is WP-Chatbot helpful for?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Any industry is a perfect case use for website chatting. WP-Chatbot is highly flexible, meaning that you can customize it for any industry, any vertical, any business type, and any audience (B2B or B2C). Here are some business types that have found the WP-Chatbot to be very useful:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chatbots for small businesses<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for restaurants<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for agencies<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for doctor\u2019s offices<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for influencers<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for consultants<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for personal trainers<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for personal coaches<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for MLM sales<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for brick-and-mortar shops<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for ecommerce<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for selling online courses<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for entrepreneurs<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for digital marketers<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for designers<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots for freelancers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>WP-Chatbot and MobileMonkey: What else can you do with the chatbot?<\/h3>\n<p>Integrating the plugin to your website and Facebook page is only the first step. Once you\u2019ve done that, the marketing possibilities are endless. You can do each one of these actions using the chatbot building platform, MobileMonkey.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Customers who engage with you are contacts for life.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the main advantages of WP-Chatbot over ordinary chatbot plugins is the chatbot integration with Facebook Messenger. When site visitors are logged into Facebook Messenger and start a conversation with your bot or live agent, users can access this chat and chat history on their phone or their desktop, not just on your website. In addition, they remain on your contact list until they choose to unsubscribe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Grow your contact list.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WP-Chatbot makes it easy and effortless to amass a huge contact list of messaging contacts. The power of chatbots goes beyond a single interaction on your website. The real power begins once you\u2019ve gained that contact.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Send contacts chat blasts.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A chat blast is a message that you can send to your entire chat mailing list. A single blast can reach thousands of potential customers with any variety of marketing messages. Within the Facebook Messenger platform, you can expect to get 80% open rates and 40% clickthrough rates within sixty minutes!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Create an RSS integration that sends new content to your mailing list.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Another powerful feature of Facebook Messenger marketing is the ability to connect your Messenger contact list with an RSS feed. Every time you publish something to the feed, it will send your mailing list a link to the content along with a custom message. All it takes is a quick thirty-second integration using MobileMonkey, and you\u2019re set forever.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Market to your messaging contact list using a drip campaign.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A drip campaign is a powerful way to methodically coax your users to conversion. Perhaps you want them to schedule a consultation, attend a webinar, or download a resource. Whatever it is you want them to do, you can create a drip campaign in MobileMonkey that allows you to achieve that. The drip campaign sends the user a series of messages in a live and interactive way. You can easily amass hundreds of conversions in a few minutes using a strategic drip campaign on Facebook Messenger or other messaging platform.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Combine the power of your chatbot plugin with your Facebook Business page.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Once you install your chatbot plugin and begin building a lead list, you can also build your lead list using Facebook. To do so, create click-to-Messenger ads on Facebook. When users convert on the ad, they are added to your Messenger mailing list. Click-to-Messenger ads are less expensive and more effective than conventional Facebook display ads. Plus, the user is consenting to allow you to message them again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You have access to a huge audience.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s messaging applications including WhatsApp and Instagram are the largest in the world, by far. 11% of the world\u2019s total population uses one of Facebook\u2019s messaging apps. With access to an audience this large, you are sure to increase your marketing reach and power.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Answer FAQs.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One great thing about chatbots is that they can be programmed to answer the questions that users are likely to ask. Setting this up in MobileMonkey is easy, and doesn\u2019t require any coding.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Qualify leads.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not everyone who starts chatting on your website will turn out to be a valuable lead. A chatbot can help qualify leads by guiding them through a series of questions. Even a certain contact isn\u2019t a lead right now, they might turn into one later. You can invite them to join a Facebook group, retain them in your contact list, or simply message them from time to time to keep them engaged.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Notify the sales team about hot leads.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When a potential lead does qualify themselves through a chatbot dialogue, you can easily alert your sales team about it. They can step in for a live chat with the potential lead and close the deal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Allow contacts to set appointments.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Does your business use appointment setting? Whether you operate a dentist office, gym, or restaurant, users can make reservations, schedule appointments, make changes to their reservation, check the status of their appointment, get directions, and more.<\/p>\n<h3>Technical Facts about the Chatbot Plugin<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of active installations:  20,000.
