I have reluctantly held off on a review as I am not one to post negative comments, especially when an app is in its initial stages - but this has become ridiculous.<\/p>\n<p>The install was without instance; UserID\/PW obtained from FreightCenter.  The backoffice looks very complete with multiple options for product origination.  The app however <strong>does not work<\/strong> in either sandbox or live modes.<\/p>\n<p>After giving access to the developer(s) there has never been a login or any activity on their part.  FreightCenter IT was initially expressed interest in finding a resolution - they no longer return phone calls or emails.  One must surmise the project is dead. <\/p>\n<p>Here are the contact numbers for FreightCenter:<br \/>\n800-716-7608<br \/>\nIT (Justin) extension: 1147<br \/>\nSales Rep: (Jennifer) extension: 1019 <\/p>\n<p>Should anyone get further than I, have a working installation, or have a woocommerce freight solution that works please post back here.
