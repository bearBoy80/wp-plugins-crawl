If you use a shelf with many books, then regardless of the &#8220;Display at most X books&#8221; setting, fetching books will take a long time because the Goodreads servers need to sort all your books before picking the X books send to the widget.<\/p>\n<p>This has two important implications. Firstly, it causes a poor experience for the first visitor to your page after the GR Progress Widget cache has expired and needs to refresh, since that user will potentially be waiting a long time for your page to load. Secondly, depending on your PHP settings, it may cause timeouts causing the widget to fail and report an &#8220;Error retrieving data from Goodreads&#8221; message. (The widget currently has a hardcoded timeout setting of 30 seconds, which is shorter than most PHP installations and longer than you should find acceptable.)<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a somewhat advanced user, you can set the widget&#8217;s cache time to 0 (infinite) and schedule an automated job (e.g. a cron job) that fetches\/visits your blog with the url variable &#8216;force_gr_progress_update&#8217; added (e.g. http:\/\/yoursite.com\/page_with_gr_progress_widget\/?force_gr_progress_update). If you do this, visitors to your site will never experience slow loading times due to the widget, because updates will be done solely by the cron job.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Troubleshooting<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Before we start, let me make clear that I have made this plugin for myself and provide it free of charge in case anyone else likes it. If it doesn&#8217;t work for you, there are a few things you can try, and I might be able to help you on the forum. But remember that I don&#8217;t have paying customers, so don&#8217;t expect me to spend much of my spare time debugging problems, particularly if I can&#8217;t reproduce them myself.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It just says &#8220;Error retrieving data from Goodreads&#8221; *<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Follow the below steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure you&#8217;ve configured it correctly. Double-check your user ID, your API key, and the shelf name. Note that the shelf name is typically something like &#8220;currently-reading&#8221;, not &#8220;Currently reading&#8221;.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure your Goodreads profile really is public. Go to your Goodreads profile, copy the URL, and visit it in a browser where you are signed out of Goodreads. If you can&#8217;t see your shelves and books, neither can this widget. If you make changes to your Goodreads privacy settings, make sure to re-save the widget settings before testing to reset the widget&#8217;s cache.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If your settings are correct and your profile is publis and it still doesn&#8217;t work, go to the plugin support forum and describe the error. Include the most important widget settings (user ID, API key, and shelf name). I will then be able to test your settings myself.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If everything works fine when I test it, there is usually little I can do for you. Note that certain webhosts have been reported to cause problems with this widget, and one user reported the widget working again after switching hosts.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why do I have to get my own Goodreads API key?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because Goodreads doesn&#8217;t allow calling any given combination of an API key and an API endpoint more than once per second. On the off-chance this plugin gets wildly popular, I don&#8217;t want Goodreads shutting down my own API key due to excessive usage.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What if I&#8217;m unable\/unwilling to use my own API key?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Create a new Goodreads user and get an API key for that user. Doesn&#8217;t matter which key you use, it just has to be a valid Goodreads API key.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is the Goodreads attribution really mandatory?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, according to the Goodreads API terms of service.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What if I style my widgets like one of the screenshots, so that the second shelf\/widget appears to be part of the first widget &#8211; can I then hide the attribution on the second widget?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>My personal guess is yes, because it would be clear from the first attribution that the data in both widgets come from Goodreads. I don&#8217;t make the rules, though.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.5.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug where multiple widgets with different user IDs produced the same shelves when the shelf names were identical<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased the widget timeout to 30 seconds, which should fix the &#8220;Error retrieving data from Goodreads&#8221; message some people have been seeing.
