If plugin doesn&#8217;t find it adds default image, you can replace it with any other. Featured image is should be added in the past add\/edit page(usually on right sidebar box)<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='my%20page%20has%20featured%20image%2C%20but%20instead%20it%20plugin%20uses%20one%20from%20previous%20card%3F'>\nMy page has Featured Image, but instead it plugin uses one from previous card?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You try to add it too fast. To pick image plugin does additional request, as featured image doesn&#8217;t included to post object, only its id. You should just wait 1-2 seconds before to click add. In the next versions we are also going to add options to collect image frob article body if it exists.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20cards%20i%20can%20add%3F'>\nHow many cards I can add?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>As many as you wish. In horizontal mode maximum cards in row is four, but  you can have more. If you amount not equal 4 for row, rest of cards also have same width and will be centered.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20icons%20do%20you%20use'>\nWhat icons do you use\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We use FontAwesome version 5. We tried to use Google Material Icons as it has 4 more parameters for settings, but unfortunately it&#8217;s done as direct code, not as class &#8211; ie it can show code, for a moments while css is loading, it&#8217;s not good, especially if icon is big as we use.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20export%20option'>\nWhat is export option\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Using export option you can copy JSON code of cards and pass it to another or even to another site. Import is looks like export &#8211; just click export tab on new cards, and paste code replacing existing default one. Don&#8217;t forget to save and reload page then<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20problem%20with%20my%20cards%2C%20how%20can%20you%20help%20me'>\nI have problem with my cards, how can you help me\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Function Export also was done for debugging, just copy code from Export tab and send.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1.1 &#8211; July 12, 2023<\/h4>\n<p>Fixed minor bugs<\/p>\n<h4>1.1.0 &#8211; July 10, 2023<\/h4>\n<p>Updated Interface<br \/>\nAdded Option to pick content Items as card data<br \/>\nAdded New Icons Picker(full screen for better selection)<br \/>\nAdded Setting Page<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2938633\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2938633\" alt=\"screenshot-1.jpg\"><\/a><p>screenshot-1.jpg<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2938633\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2938633\" alt=\"screenshot-2.jpg\"><\/a><p>screenshot-2.jpg<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=2938633\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=2938633\" alt=\"screenshot-3.jpg\"><\/a><p>screenshot-3.jpg<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=2938633\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=2938633\" alt=\"screenshot-4.jpg\"><\/a><p>screenshot-4.jpg<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-5.jpg?rev=2890639\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-5.jpg?rev=2890639\" alt=\"screenshot-5.jpg\"><\/a><p>screenshot-5.jpg<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oss-cards.1.1.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2938633","caption":"screenshot-1.jpg"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2938633","caption":"screenshot-2.jpg"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=2938633","caption":"screenshot-3.jpg"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=2938633","caption":"screenshot-4.jpg"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/screenshot-5.jpg?rev=2890639","caption":"screenshot-5.jpg"}},"tags":{"cards":"cards","display-featured-posts":"display featured posts","display-pages":"display pages","link-cards":"link cards","link-internal":"link internal"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oss-cards.1.0.0.zip","1.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oss-cards.1.1.0.zip","1.1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oss-cards.1.1.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/oss-cards.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/vivapro.net\/donate\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2938633","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/oss-cards\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2938633"}}
