Lock down your admin login form and load up another site instead for unwanted guests.<\/p>\n<p>On servers with limited memory, recursive calls to your WordPress admin login panel alone can lead to serious memory and load<br \/>\nissues that can potentially crash your server. This plugin prevents access to<br \/>\nthe login screen without the correct access code appended to the url.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin will kill the process of loading the admin panel prior to the loading of<br \/>\nthe template, and other such resource intensive processes that occur even when a user is not yet logged in.<\/p>\n<p>How to Use<br \/>\n1. Create your access code.<br \/>\n2. Click the Activate Admin Lock checkbox.<br \/>\n3. Optionally divert traffic to another url.<br \/>\n4. Future admin login should use the following URL:<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/www.yoursite.com\/wp-admin\/?a=CODE<br \/>\nWhere &#8220;CODE&#8221; is the access code you enter.<\/p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.transcendevelopment.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">www.TranscenDevelopment.com<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the &#8220;td-admin-lock&#8221; folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Log into Wordpres and go to Settings-&gt;TD Lock Admin<\/li>\n<li>Configure and activate as desired<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"<p>None yet&#8230;feel free to ask \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Various bugs fixed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A new plugin is born.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/td-admin-lock-load\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=845927\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/td-admin-lock-load\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=845927\" alt=\"Divert unwanted traffic to your admin login off to any url you desire.
