If so, this plugin might help you make your client happy.<\/p>\n<p>How to use:<\/p>\n<p>When you activate the plugin, it adds a custom post type to your website called &#8220;Email Templates&#8221;. You can create your templates using this custom post type. Templates can contain placeholders for your code to fill them up with desired values. A placeholder sample would be {USERNAME} or {USER_EMAIL}. Please note, placeholders should not contain lowercase letters.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin creates a global instance of the BlueCube\\Email_Template class which is called $bluecube_email_template. Once you have created a template, you can use the sendEmail() method of the instance to send out your emails.<\/p>\n<pre><code>$email_args = array(\n    'template_title'    =&gt; 'your-template-title',\n    'to'                =&gt; $email,\n    'variables'         =&gt; array('username' =&gt; 'JohnDoe', 'user_email' =&gt; 'test@test.com'),\n);\n$bluecube_email_template-&gt;sendEmail($email_args);\n<\/code><\/pre>\n","installation":"<p>Download and unzip the plugin.
