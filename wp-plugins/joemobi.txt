Bloggers and website administrators can build their own native apps with no programming knowledge necessary! Set up couldn&#8217;t be more simple &#8211; if you can install a plugin to your WordPress website, you have all the skills you need.<\/p>\n<h4>Customized Mobile App<\/h4>\n<p>Once this plugin is installed, start creating your app using the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joemobi.com\/\" title=\"Mobile App Creator\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">JoeMobi App Creator<\/a>. Just choose your colors, upload your icons and header image, and you&#8217;re done. Then sit back and reap the benefits of having your blog on the mobile scene!<\/p>\n<h4>Fully Native App<\/h4>\n<p>The app you create is a native iPhone, Android and BlackBerry applications &#8211; not just a wrapper for your website. Publish your app to the Apple iTunes App Store, Android Market or BlackBerry App World for maximum exposure.<\/p>\n<h4>Why does this matter?<\/h4>\n<p>Users of different smartphone platforms &#8212; like iPhone, Android and BlackBerry &#8212; are accustomed to using their devices in different ways. Your users will get the experience they expect from an app on their device, without you having to know the intricacies of mobile user interaction.<\/p>\n<h4>Notifications<\/h4>\n<p>How does your user know when you&#8217;ve published new content on your website? With app notifications, of course! JoeMobi has push notifications built in, so when you publish a new post, your app users will know right away.<\/p>\n<h4>Let Your Readers Comment<\/h4>\n<p>There are lots of app creators that simply take in your website&#8217;s RSS feed. But that&#8217;s boring; your mobile readers want to interact with your site as much as your website readers want to, so we let them.<\/p>\n<p>If you use WordPress&#8217;s default comment system or <a href=\"http:\/\/disqus.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Disqus<\/a>, users of your app will be able to leave comments. And they&#8217;ll show up on your website, too!<\/p>\n<h4>App Analytics<\/h4>\n<p>View your overall app usage, number of downloads and number of push notifications, and app usage across each platform!<\/p>\n<h4>More Information<\/h4>\n<p>For more information about JoeMobi, visit our website at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joemobi.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">JoeMobi.com<\/a><br \/>\nFollow us on <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Joe_Mobi\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twitter<\/a><br \/>\nLike us on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/joemobiapp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the &#8216;joemobi&#8217; folder to the &#8216;\/wp-content\/plugins\/&#8217; directory.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>After installation of JoeMobi WordPress plugin, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joemobi.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">www.joemobi.com<\/a> and start creating your mobile application for free.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>After the installation is complete do I need to configure anything in my WordPress for the plugin to work or be active?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you must go onto your WordPress blog and make sure that the plugin is active.
