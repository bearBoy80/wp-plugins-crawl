Creates a custom field on the author profile pages so they can input their campaign ID. Whoever wrote the post gets credit in the listing.<\/p>\n<p>A few of the features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Specify the search with a custom field in the post called ebay_search<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Use a shortcode to insert or code in your template file<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Allows you to use the eBay Partner Network<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Allows multi-author blogs to share revenue, you can even specify the percentage to share<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Can share revenue with the author of the post if you desire<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Uses advanced search parameters<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Display is easily customizable<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Hides the affiliate link to ebay<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<p>WP eBay Ads is installed like any other WordPress plugin.<\/p>\n<p>1) Download the latest package from the downloads page (https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/wp-ebay-ads\/).<\/p>\n<p>2) Upload the whole directory into your wordpress plugins directory (usually, yoursite\/wp-content\/plugins). The plugin must reside in a sub-folder called &#8220;wp-ebay-ads&#8221; (lower-case!) as supplied in the zip file, else it WON?T WORK<\/p>\n<p>3) Go into the WordPress admin panel, find Plugins and WP eBay Ads should be listed. Click Activate to activate!<\/p>\n<p>Using WP eBay Ads<\/p>\n<p>There are two ways to use WP eBay Ads. Pick either 1) or 2) then move to step 3).<\/p>\n<p>1) Place the following shortcode directly in your post.<\/p>\n<pre><code>[wpebayads]\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>2) You can also get the listings by placing the following code in your template file for your single post. Usually called single.php. Place it inside the loop. I like to place it right after the_content tag.<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php if(function_exists('wp_ebay_ads')) {wp_ebay_ads($post-&gt;ID);}?&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<ul>\n<li>After you either use the shortcode in your post or edit your template file then all you have to do is add a custom field to the post called ebay_search. Set the value for what you are searching for.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>ex:<\/p>\n<p>Name: ebay_search<\/p>\n<p>Value: ipod<\/p>\n<p>3) View the post and you should see the listing show up.<\/p>\n<p>4) Go to the &#8220;WP eBay Ads&#8221; admin panel under the Settings dropdown, and modify what you would like.<\/p>\n<p>5) For multi-author blogs, each author needs to enter their campaign ID on their profile page in the input field added at the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>Notes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the ebay_search custom field is not used or blank then the ads will not be displayed.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>You can use the [wpebayads] shortcode method and the template code method at the same time.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>More about search terms:<\/p>\n<p>It can be difficult to target searches, so here are some more tips :<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>green lamp &#8211; this is logical, a space between the words means all products with &#8220;green&#8221; and &#8220;lamp&#8221; in the title.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8220;green lamp&#8221; &#8211; exact phrase match means the exact phrase &#8220;green lamp&#8221; must be found in the product title<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>lamp -green &#8211; AND NOT &#8211; searches for all occurrences of &#8220;lamp&#8221;, but minus sign excludes any titles with &#8220;green&#8221;. No green lamps here!<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>(lamp,&#8221;bedside table&#8221;) &#8211; OR &#8211; brackets apply logical OR (also AND\/OR I think) to all items in the brackets, whether single keywords or phrases, i.e. this will find all items with either &#8220;lamp&#8221; OR &#8220;bedside table&#8221;.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>(&#8220;old lamp&#8221;,&#8221;old telephone&#8221;) -green &#8211; find all items with either &#8220;old lamp&#8221; or &#8220;old telephone&#8221; in the title, but excluding &#8220;green&#8221;.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>lamp -(book,CD) &#8211; this will search on &#8220;lamp&#8221; BUT will exclude &#8220;book&#8221; and\/or &#8220;CD&#8221;. This type of search is especially useful as it allows you to eliminate most of the junk\/irrelevant items like &#8220;My Old Lamp CD&#8221; and narrow the search down to just actual lamps! Though some of these searches can get quite long, and there is a limit to the number of terms. Just experiment.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By the way,  you are not suppose to put spaces after commas or minus signs.<\/p>\n<p>There is more help on the relevant eBay page (http:\/\/pages.ebay.com\/help\/search\/advanced-search.html?fromFeature=Advanced%20Search).<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>I don&#8217;t see the mulit-author settings.<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must be using WordPress V2.8 or higher.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why should I contribute or leave the powered by link?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because you&#8217;re a cool person and like to show your appreciation.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>fixed issue with currency not displaying correctly<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>minor bug fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>minor bug fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>minor bug fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed error with hidden ebay link redirect.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the ability to use shortcode.
