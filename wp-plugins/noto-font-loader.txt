It loads the correct Noto font file from Google Fonts depending on the site\u2019s locale and overrides theme&#8217;s font settings.<\/p>\n<h4>The Goal<\/h4>\n<p>Most of WordPress themes are designed to display western languages. When I try to use them on Japanese sites, it looks awkward due to lack of proper font settings (these languages need to use a font other than default in order to look cool). So when I met Noto font, I liked the font&#8217;s concept to cover every Unicode letters.<\/p>\n<p>But the font files are separated for each language&#8217;s character set. I thought it might be handy if the site could automatically choose which Noto font to use based on the site&#8217;s locale.<\/p>\n<h4>When To Use<\/h4>\n<p>This plugin might be for you if you are in either of below situations:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your site is translated into Chinese, Japanese and\/or Korean<\/li>\n<li>You just want to use Noto font<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Covered Languages<\/h4>\n<p>The plugin currently handles the language-font combinations listed below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Japanese &#8211; Noto Sans\/Serif JP<\/li>\n<li>Korean &#8211; Noto Sans\/Serif KR<\/li>\n<li>Simplified Chinese &#8211; Noto Sans\/Serif SC<\/li>\n<li>Traditional Chinese &#8211; Noto Sans\/Serif TC<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are the languages graduated from <a href=\"https:\/\/fonts.google.com\/earlyaccess\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Early Access<\/a> directory and officially listed in Google Fonts. I intend to update the plugin when the more languages are added in the future.<\/p>\n<p>For all other locales, it uses standard Latin subset (Noto Sans\/Serif).<\/p>\n<h4>Settings<\/h4>\n<p>From admin panel, you can choose what style to use from these 4 options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sans-serif<\/li>\n<li>Serif<\/li>\n<li>Headers: Serif \/ Body: Sans-serif<\/li>\n<li>Headers: Sans-serif \/ Body: Serif<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/noto-font-loader.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"font":"font"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
