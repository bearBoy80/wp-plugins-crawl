They offer giving through their app &#8211; but also provide a &#8216;Give&#8217; button to be inserted into your website. This plugin makes it easy for you to insert your Tithely &#8216;Give&#8217; button into your WordPress Site &#8211; using either a Sidebar Widget or a Shortcode.<\/p>\n<p>Requires SSL Certificate<\/p>\n<p>Whilst Tithely processes payments securely &#8211; we recommend you only use the give button on  a page that is protected with SSL encryption. It&#8217;s pretty cheap to add and usually costs around $30-50 a year depending on the service.
