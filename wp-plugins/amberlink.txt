The more routes we provide to information, the more all people can freely share that information, even in the face of filtering or blockages. Amber adds to these routes.<\/p>\n<p>Amber automatically preserves a snapshot of every page linked to on a website, giving visitors a fallback option if links become inaccessible. If one of the pages linked to on this website were to ever go down, Amber can provide visitors with access to an alternate version. This safeguards the promise of the URL: that information placed online can remain there, even amidst network or endpoint disruptions.<\/p>\n<p>Lots of copies keeps stuff safe. By default, Amber stores snapshots directly on the host website. But users can choose to store snapshots using a combination of the following third party storage and archiving systems: the Internet Archive, Perma.cc, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).<\/p>\n<p>Amber is an open source project led by the <a href=\"https:\/\/cyber.law.harvard.edu\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society<\/a>. It builds on a proposal from Tim Berners-Lee and Jonathan Zittrain for a &#8220;mutual aid treaty for the Internet&#8221; that would enable operators of websites to enter easily into mutually beneficial agreements and bolster the robustness of the entire web. The project also aims to mitigate risks associated with increasing centralization of online content.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more at <a href=\"http:\/\/amberlink.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Amberlink.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n","installation":"<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/25Kz7PqapG4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<p>Full installation instructions, as well as a guide for configurations and settings, can be found on the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/berkmancenter\/amber_wordpress\/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Amber wiki guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly, or upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/plugin-name<\/code> directory.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Use the Settings -&gt; Amber screen to configure Amber.<\/li>\n<li>Start preserving links!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Other Requirements<\/h4>\n<p>PHP cURL extension enabled<\/p>\n","faq":"<p>Here are two of the most frequently asked questions.

This is no different when it comes to using Amber. When you use Amber, you are preserving the copyrighted content of other publishers. Many uses of Amber &#8212; linking to and preserving a webpage for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research &#8212; likely constitute fair use under United States law and thus do not infringe on copyrights. However, users of Amber should be aware that fair use rights vary significantly in different countries around the world. In addition, there are limits to fair use.<\/p>\n<p>For a helpful guide on fair use, please visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dmlp.org\/legal-guide\/fair-use\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Digital Media Law Project<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For additional information on intellectual property issues that concern bloggers, please visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/issues\/bloggers\/legal\/liability\/IP\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Electronic Frontier Foundation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can websites opt-out of having their webpages preserved through Amber?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Amber respects the Robots Exclusion Standard and does not preserve any web page that opts out of web crawling via this protocol. It also uses the user agent &#8220;Amber&#8221; when preserving web pages, which you can choose to disallow on your website.

Primary data collected by the Berkman Klein Center and our partners, as well as relevant secondary data, will one day help answer the difficult question of &#8220;Which URLs are down for whom, where, when, and why?&#8221; While such a complete system is not in operation right now, eventually users of Amber can enable this feature to benefit from (by retrieving and contributing) such data.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Curious about previous releases before we were part of the WordPress plugin directory?

This plug-in does a great job of making this dream become more realistic. \n\nVery handy how it automatically archives all the links in each blog post. The plug-in will tell you which links were successfully saved, and which aren't. It does not archive tweets or flickr photos. But it does a handy job of archiving other articles. You can even set the limit of how big each archived article is, and the you can set the maximum limit of all the archived articles held on your domain.\n\nIf you like, you can even bulk archive all the links on your blog at once! (use the Amber Dashboard). If you believe in an internet that is a resource for future generations, please consider using the Amber plug-in to archive all your links. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/amberlink.1.4.4.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/amberlink\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1335724","caption":"If a link on your website were to go down, Amber provides your visitors with a snapshot of that link."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/amberlink\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1335702","caption":"Mobile compatibility provides all visitors with the ability to view these snapshots."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/amberlink\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1335724","caption":"You can configure the snapshot storage and delivery preferences to fit the needs of your website and visitors."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/amberlink\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1335724","caption":"Ensure the content to which you link never vanishes down the memory hole."}},"tags":{"archiving":"archiving","links":"links"},"versions":{"1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/amberlink.1.4.zip","1.4.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/amberlink.1.4.1.zip","1.4.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/amberlink.1.4.2.zip","1.4.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/amberlink.1.4.3.zip","1.4.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/amberlink.1.4.4.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/amberlink.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/cyber.law.harvard.edu","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/amberlink\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1333229","high":false}}
