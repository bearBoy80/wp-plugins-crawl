WordPress&#8217; Import tool requires a properly working site in order to import its media files mentioned in the XML file (exported file). It is not always possible to restore<br \/>\na broken site using its exported XML file which was exported and saved when the site<br \/>\nwas in good shape.<\/p>\n<p>Is this plugin a migration tool? Can I move blogs\/sites across servers? This plugin can migrate blogs from one multisite WP to another, provided that both<br \/>\nWordPress are the same version and CUABR is installed on both of them.<br \/>\nBut; still; care must be taken while attemptying this.<\/p>\n<p>Will this plugin work on a WordPress server installed on a MS-Windows host? No! This plugin works only on Linux\/UNIX servers.<\/p>\n<p>Can I use this plugin to backup\/restore a single site WordPress blog\/site? No! The plugin works ONLY on multi-site WordPress installations.<\/p>\n<p>What does it take to set up a multi-site WordPress server? Actually not much! Why don&#8217;t you have a look at https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Create_A_Network<br \/>\nto see how easy it is to set up a multi-site WordPress Network.<br \/>\n(You&#8217;ll need root shell access to the server).<\/p>\n<p>Will you develop a multi-lingual version? No!<\/p>\n","changelog":"<p>N\/A<\/p>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/cua-backuprestore.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"backup":"backup","multisite":"multisite","restore":"restore"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/cua-backuprestore.1.0.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
