Make sure you read the documentation as this plugin is capable of quite a lot. We had a few issues along the way but support was amazing. A few times we were just being plain dumb and another the plugin wasn't able to do what we wanted, but they agreed it was a good idea and a few days later an update was released containing our new feature! <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Fantastic plugin with excellent and quick support!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/orgiz\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6eed0201113eb444ce31572dd0a64167?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6eed0201113eb444ce31572dd0a64167?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/orgiz\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">orgiz<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 13, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">I recently purchased the premium version of this plugin after searching the entire internet weeks for one that is quite flexible in how calendars and bookings can be set up, where everything is kept very clean without unnecessary features.

When setting it up, I ran into a couple of minor problems, but they were quickly (within a couple of hours) resolved by the support team. Later, I wanted to add another pricing functionality than what was available in the interface (fixed + variable rate) so I contacted the support team again. Also this time they quickly responded and got back to me with a code snippet the next working day, which worked great. Overall, fantastic support and great plugin. Highly recommended!<br \/>(For future versions, it would be nice with built-in functionality to change the fonts (I had to make the change with CSS this time) and the general looks of the calenda and forms. I would also like the option to change the layout of the forms so that it is possible to use to columns instead of having it all in one row.)<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Stellar Support!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/xordinary\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6b075d105a38d7de07818575158107e5?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6b075d105a38d7de07818575158107e5?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/xordinary\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">xordinary<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 2, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">I had two individual problems (one technical: no invoice or contract would attach to the automated email reminders and one tax-related).
