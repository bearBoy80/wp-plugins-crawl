This means the browser downloads 1 file instead of 5, 10, or 20.<\/p>\n<p>Minification removes all unnecessary space from a file. This means you only download the content you actually need.<\/p>\n<p>To speed up your site, most developers will recommend you do both.  But it can be time-consuming and frustrating to set this up &#8211; particularly as you install new plugins on your site.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than forcing you to merge and minify files manually, this plugin will do it for you automatically.  No configuration is needed, just activate and go.<\/p>\n<p>This is very much a <strong>beta version<\/strong> of the plugin and is not expected to be stable.
