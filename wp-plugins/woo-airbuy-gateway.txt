We open up e-commerce stores to customers without bank details as well as insecure online buyers who are not comfortable revealing their bank details online.<\/p>\n<p>Airbuy is currently a payment gateway for South African e-commerce stores and only accepts payments in ZAR (South African Rand). Please ensure that your WooCommerce currency is set to South African Rand (R).<\/p>\n<p>Once a customer checks out using Airbuy, their cart will be cleared and they will be directed to our platform to make the payment. The customer will then be redirected back in to your store and met by a message, notifying them on whether the transaction was successful or unsuccessful.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any edits made to the plugin to bypass certain features\/restraints are done so at your own risk, Airbuy will not be held responsible or accountable for any payments made or transactions failing as a result after a plugin provided by us has been edited.
