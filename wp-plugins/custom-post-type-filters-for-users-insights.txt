Sometimes however, you might need to list, search and filter your user list by the number of posts that they have created from a specific post type only. This plugin allows you to do this by adding the following features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>List the number of posts that each user has created from each custom post type<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/usersinsights.com\/wordpress-users-smart-filters\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_campaign=cpt\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Filter the user list<\/a> by the number of posts that they have created from each custom post type<\/li>\n<li>Sort the user list by the number of posts that they have created from each custom post type<\/li>\n<li>Select which post types to be available on the Users Insights table<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Make sure that the <a href=\"https:\/\/usersinsights.com\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_campaign=cpt\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Users Insights plugin<\/a> is installed and activated.<\/li>\n<li>Log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.<\/li>\n<li>In the search field type \u201cCustom Post Types For Users Insights\u201d and click Search Plugins.
