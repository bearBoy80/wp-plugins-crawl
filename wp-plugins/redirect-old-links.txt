But no more! If someone goes to an old link for your site, I&#8217;ll find the new link and redirect them there automatically.<\/p>\n<p>No configuration. No one-by-one setting of the new link structures. No wrestling with complicated regex patterns.

I automatically tests all 404 links to see if they might resolve to an existing post.

Then I search for any posts with that name. If I find one, I redirect the user to the post I found. Since I use this method, I won&#8217;t work for <em>all<\/em> permalink structures.
