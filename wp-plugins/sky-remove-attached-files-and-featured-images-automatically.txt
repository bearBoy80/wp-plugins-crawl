Me), and the guys use the plugin, they do not pay anything, and even then they do not avail the plugin, they are not willing to do the minimum, this plugin here is essential to not inflate the server with useless images, I'm too poor at the moment , But this plugin deserves more than votes, and the people do not even do that.
