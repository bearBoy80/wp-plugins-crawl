The theme was originally built on the 960.css grid. This was fine a few years ago and still is for many but I<br \/>\nwanted more usable width for the wider screens.\u00a0At first I just hacked the original 960.css file and kept a back-up copy. When updating the theme though it was<br \/>\n written over with the original file and I&#8217;d have to replace it again. \u00a0After developing many sites using the U-Design theme that became quite tedious so I wrote this little plugin.<br \/>\n It simply deregisters the 960 style sheet and enqueue&#8217;s the 1150 style sheet (1152px Wide with 24 Columns &amp; 10px Margins).<br \/>\n I hope you find it useful.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Follow the normal plugin activation steps.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Where is the plugin accessed once activated<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no further set-up required.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.02<\/h4>\n<p>Added function to enqueue the style sheet using the proper WP Hook.<\/p>\n<h4>1.01<\/h4>\n<p>Renamed css file to grid.css fixed broken path to file.<\/p>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Release Version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/u-design-1150.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"1152":"1152","960":"960","css":"css","plugins":"plugins","themes":"themes"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"http:\/\/gtmanagement.com\/plugins\/u-design-1150\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/u-design-1150\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=776877","high":false}}
