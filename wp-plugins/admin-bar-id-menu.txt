This plugin does one simple thing: it displays the ID number of the page, post, category, or tag you are looking at in the WordPress Admin Bar. It appends this ID to the edit menu already on the Admin Bar. Needless to say, that means that this plugin is only useful for WordPress version 3.1 or above, since the Admin Bar was first introduced with 3.1.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>admin-bar-id-menu<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='why%20would%20anyone%20need%20this%3F'>\nWhy would anyone need this?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are asking this question, you don&#8217;t need this at all.
