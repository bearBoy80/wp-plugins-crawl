I always assumed that ad blocking was insignificant but I was curious, so I installed this plugin.\nActually I have over 30% of my users who use ad block!!!! It is insane isn't?\n\nNow Publica helps me bypass adblockers and show my video ads to those users. In a week, my revenue increased by 25% which is awesome.\nThanks guys<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/publica-ad-block-recovery.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/publica-ad-block-recovery\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1639283","caption":"Show the Publica Ad Block Recovery login page on the Wordpress Admin page underneath Settings."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/publica-ad-block-recovery\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1639283","caption":"Shows a valid installation of the Publica Ad Block Recovery script on Wordpress Admin page underneath Settings."}},"tags":{"publica":"publica","publisher-revenue-recovery":"publisher revenue recovery","video":"video","videos":"videos"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
