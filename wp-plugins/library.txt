Each of these uses a shortcode to display the most up-to-date version of a term&#8217;s content.<\/p>\n<p>A financial institution is advertising an interest rate across many pages on a large website. There are instances of this percentage in content and in templates. Within a matter of seconds all of these numbers can be changed rather than crossing your fingers and hoping you caught all of the rates.<\/p>\n<p>In order to quickly change the price of a fluctuating product a company put their price in a term to update across the whole site.<\/p>\n<p>A health insurance company uses the same disclosures on many pages and UI contexts and keeping them compliant with changing regulations was difficult until they kept them stored in the Library.<\/p>\n<p>The copyright line in the footer of a website might change sometimes to reflect a new year, a new trademark, new ownership, etc.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/developdaly\/library\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>Contribute on Github<\/strong><\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/developdaly\/library\/issues?labels=bug&amp;milestone=&amp;page=1&amp;state=open\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>Report Bugs<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>Using The WordPress Dashboard<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the &#8216;Add New&#8217; in the plugins dashboard<\/li>\n<li>Search for &#8216;library&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Click &#8216;Install Now&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin on the Plugin dashboard<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Uploading in WordPress Dashboard<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the &#8216;Add New&#8217; in the plugins dashboard<\/li>\n<li>Navigate to the &#8216;Upload&#8217; area<\/li>\n<li>Select <code>library.zip<\/code> from your computer<\/li>\n<li>Click &#8216;Install Now&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Using FTP<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Download <code>library.zip<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Extract the <code>library<\/code> directory to your computer<\/li>\n<li>Upload the <code>library<\/code> directory to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds a media button to easily insert shortcodes<\/li>\n<li>Improved error handling<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Localized admin screen strings<\/li>\n<li>Escaped admin screen strings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated base language file<\/li>\n<li>Typo fixes<\/li>\n<li>Removed blank index.php files<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/library.1.1.0.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"content":"content","dictionary":"dictionary","library":"library","shortcodes":"shortcodes","strings":"strings"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/library.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/library.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/library.1.0.2.zip","1.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/library.1.1.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/library.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
