Beside this, it would mean loosing quite a lot of time.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to Gutenberg, you can find it as a block with the help of this plugin. Add your ad codes to your settings and change your ad codes by simply selecting the ad title anywhere in the content.  You can also change the ad code any time from your settings and the new changes will apply itself on the entire website!<\/p>\n<p>Ps: This plugin works only with Gutenberg Editor (WordPress&#8217;s blocks editor).<\/p>\n<p>Developed by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cagdasdag95\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>\u00c7a\u011fda\u015f Da\u011f<\/strong><\/a>.
