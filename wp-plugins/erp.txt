However, it has not been ideal for my needs\n\n1. The Accounting Module: I only had the option to use cash and I couldn't list where my transactions were going nor create a bank account as an option. I had to deactivate the module\n\n2. HR: I found that I could not import my already existing WP users. When I tried to enter employee details from scratch, it said that the user already existed. I initially thought that I was not understanding how to use the plugin, so I did a Google search and found that in 2018 someone else had asked this question. However, the developers have not found the need to resolve this issue, so I deactivated the plugin completely. \n\n\nIf you are launching a brand new website with no users added already, I think this would be a pretty ok plugin to use just for the HR module. Sadly, I can't recommend the accounting module\n\nI've not need to use the project manager and CRM modules yet, so I cannot comment on them at the moment<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Awfull Support<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/cashcreatorsclub\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/baeaabb92af2b69a9bb27ff600174f49?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/baeaabb92af2b69a9bb27ff600174f49?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/cashcreatorsclub\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">cashcreatorsclub<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 7, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">If you need support to solve the many bugs this premium plugin has, you will get very little response so please prepare yourself when you buy this.
