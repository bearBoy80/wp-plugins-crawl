They get fixed when the developers become aware of them.<br \/>\nHowever, sometimes several WordPress releases are vulnerable. The problem is that the developers do not backport security updates to older WordPress releases.<br \/>\nAs a result, those who do not want to upgrade their WordPress installations (for example, because newer WP releases tend to consume more system resources and<br \/>\nupgrade may result in having to use more expensive hosting) remain vulnerable.<\/p>\n<p>ICS Security Fixes is the plugin for those who do not upgrade their WordPress: the plugin tries to fix known WordPress vulnerabilities<br \/>\nat that remaining compatible with as many old WordPress releases as possible.<br \/>\nAnd though it cannot fix all known vulnerabilities, it makes older WordPress installations more secure.<\/p>\n<h3>Warning<\/h3>\n<p>This plugins requires that PHP 5 be installed.
