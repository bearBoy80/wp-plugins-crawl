Your plugin has a beautiful design.  I also liked that star ratings can be brought up on the side menu for a quick evaluation.<br \/>\nI have not re-tested it due to limited time and I have submitted my project yesterday to the client.  However, seeing your work, I believe you will correct the few glitches.<\/p>\n<p>I always feel bad when I have to deduct a star knowing how much work there is behind all of your work.  The less one star should not discourage anyone for giving your plugin a fear trial.<\/p>\n<p>Best wishes!<\/p>\n<p>------------------<br \/>\nAs of this review, I have the Star Review Manager Version: 1.2.2<br \/>\nFirst install, I had difficulty figuring the shortcode as the given one didn't pick up anything.  Current shortcode is<br \/>\n<code>[srm_review_form container_id=2 srm_review id=2 option_type=&quot;stars&quot;]<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Everything seemed just so fantastic.  The rating system was quickly setup.  Now I wanted to publish.<\/p>\n<p>First problem:<br \/>\nSince I am a developer and preparing this for a client, I added my email for testing purposes.  Later wanted to change, but there is no 'Edit' option to change notification email.<\/p>\n<p>Just confirmed inside database:  uninstall does not remove the srm_..tables.  They are still there.  I will go ahead and remove them manually.<\/p>\n<p>Second problem:<br \/>\nAlthough plugin looked like it was uninstalled.  I installed it again, but there must have been traces somewhere in WordPress database, because it started giving me the following error message<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in \/...\/...\/public_html\/blog\/wp-content\/plugins\/star-review-manager\/views\/view.reviewform.php on line 55<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>.<\/p>\n<p>I repeated the install\/ uninstall but this time the 'Manage review instances' navigation item would not uninstall from WP admin menu.<br \/>\nUnfortunately, I had not taken any database backup for the past 3 days, but I went through the whole recovery of a 3 day old backup.  Everything is messed up and I have to install WordPress all over again.<\/p>\n<p>What I don't get is that plugins are posted on WP and they are nowhere near beta testing.  As developer, you should have tested install\/uninstall processes ahead of time.<\/p>\n<p>If we can resolve the above issues, I am willing to give this plugin another try because the first time it was setup, it seemed to do the magic and would change it to 5 star.<\/p>\n<p>*Update:  after uninstall of plugin, its (srm_tables) are still in the database.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">It works very well<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/paul-vanc\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1c92943db32c744ddbb6b7340e93ad68?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1c92943db32c744ddbb6b7340e93ad68?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/paul-vanc\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Paul VANC<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>This plugin works very well.
