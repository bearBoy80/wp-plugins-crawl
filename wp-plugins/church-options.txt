The Church Options plugin creates those post types with the check of a box. These post types include Events, Announcements, Sermons, Ministries, People (staff), and Verses. Most of them also have custom fields for things like dates and contacts.<\/p>\n<p>For these post types and fields to be used <strong>requires<\/strong> a theme custom made to work with them.
