PeerPal Widget is hosted on: (https:\/\/widget.peerpal.com\/), and uses query parameters based on your organization name and color in our database to load relevant data for you.<\/p>\n<p>This official PeerPal Widget plugin makes it easier than ever for organizations using WordPress to implement. The PeerPal Widget shortcode replaces the iframe html tag containing (https:\/\/widget.peerpal.com\/\/) and allows you to customize the chat widget. For example, after you input your organization name and color, you can have the widget render to the left with side=\u2018left\u2019. Additionally, you can control how far off the edge of the screen the widget is by moving it up or pushing it down.<br \/>\nYou may use PeerPal Widget shortcode on any page you desire, to embed the chat widget onto your desired webpage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Important<\/strong>: This plugin is meant for PeerPal customers only, please go to our website: https:\/\/graduway.com\/products\/admissions to schedule a demo.<\/p>\n<h4>General Support Guidelines<\/h4>\n<p>If you are a PeerPal customer that needs support, please email support@graduway.com for support and further questions, please do not file a support ticket on the WordPress plugin page itself.
