This plugin lets you redefine such functions without having to edit the WP core files.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin is meant for advanced users or plugin developers. The reason for developing it was that some of my favorite plugins (term-management-tools, subscribe2, wp-dtree-30) didn&#8217;t work properly when I had a non-standard WP installation. My installation consists of a blog assets folder containing all the stuff that I want to keep unchanged acrross multiple WP versions, and it contains <code>wp-content<\/code> as well. But unfortunately, the functions <code>plugin_dir_url<\/code> and <code>plugins_url<\/code> that many plugin authors make use of give unexpected results in this setup. If I modified the plugin code, it would be impossible to updrade the plugins automatically (without obliterating my modifications). If I modified the functions in WP core files to make the plugins work again, it would be impossible to painlessly upgrade my WP installation. Redefining the offending functions using a separate plugin was the right choice.<\/p>\n<p>Note that this plugin uses a <code>pecl<\/code> package called <code>apd<\/code> which provides the <code>rename_function<\/code>. You could easily change the code to make it use <code>runkit<\/code>, but it didn&#8217;t work for me. If all that is Greek to you, perhaps you shouldn&#8217;t use this plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Once again, this plugin is meant for advanced users and may make your blog installation unstable or even unusable. It gives a very niche, non-standard functionality that may be useful for some plugin or PHP developers.<\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>Searching<\/h4>\n<p>The easiest way to install this plugin is to use the WordPress Admin interface.

Does the output look fine?<\/li>\n<li>If the function output still does not look right, click on the &#8220;Kill Functions&#8221; button and then hit the &#8220;Test Functions&#8221; button again.<\/li>\n<li>The output should have the right values now.<\/li>\n<li>If not, sorry, I am out of ideas. You may look at the plugin code in redefinedFunctions*.php and may be able to fix your issues.<\/li>\n<li>If you do, please leave a comment here so that others can benefit from your efforts.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How does it do it?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>In most cases, defining your <code>WP_CONTENT_DIR<\/code> properly is good enough to solve the issue. The &#8220;Kill Functions&#8221; button basically removes the current definitions of the functions and replaces them with what is in the <code>redefinedFunctions1.php<\/code>. For it to work, your PHP installation will need to have a function called <code>rename_function<\/code>, which is part of the APD package. If this package is not found, the plugin will gracefully exit.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<ul>\n<li>V2.50: Compatibility with WP4.8. Sunset edition.
