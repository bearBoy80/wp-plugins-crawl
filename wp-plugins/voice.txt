There were a couple of minor bugs, as I'd expect in a beta release. I raised a ticket and I'm happy to report that I received a swift response. The bugs are gone, and I can carry on. \n\nThe idea of Sunbreak Voice is simple; add narration to text blocks. Add the voice block, then either drag existing textual blocks inside it, or create new ones. The plugin takes care of the rest. It's easy to use, and provides instant gratification. Now my blog reads to you!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/voice.1.0.6.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/voice\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2290400","caption":"Creating a new Voice Block"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/voice\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2290400","caption":"Transforming an existing Quote block into a Voice block"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/voice\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2290400","caption":"The Twenty-Twenty theme displaying Voice blocks"}},"tags":{"block":"block","blocks":"blocks","text-to-speech":"text to speech","tts":"tts","voice":"voice"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/voice.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/voice.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/voice.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/voice.1.0.3.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/voice.1.0.4.zip","1.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/voice.1.0.5.zip","1.0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/voice.1.0.6.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/voice.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/sunbreak.io\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/voice\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2290408","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/voice\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2290400"}}
