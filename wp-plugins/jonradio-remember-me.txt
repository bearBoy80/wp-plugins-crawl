This plugin uses a documented standard WordPress Action (&#8220;hook&#8221;) and a Post variable used by WordPress just for this purpose, i.e. &#8211; straight PHP with no JavaScript.<\/p>\n<p>Deciding whether this plugin is for you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress always leaves the Remember Me checkbox empty, even if you selected it the last time you logged on;<\/li>\n<li>Without Remember Me checked, logoff occurs automatically when the browser is closed or two days have passed;<\/li>\n<li>Without Remember Me checked, some browsers will force a login when opening a new browser window;<\/li>\n<li>With Remember Me checked, logoff occurs automatically in two weeks;<\/li>\n<li>With Remember Me checked, the user remains logged in even if the browser is closed, the user&#8217;s computer is rebooted or the web site hosting server is rebooted;<\/li>\n<li>Web sites that can only be viewed by registered users (e.g. &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/jonradio-private-site\/\" title=\"My Private Site\" rel=\"ugc\">My Private Site plugin<\/a>) are more likely to want Remember Me pre-selected for each user at login, as web site viewing will be more frequently repeated than WordPress Administration;<\/li>\n<li>For public or shared computers, the WordPress behaviour of leaving the Remember Me checkbox empty is a slight Security improvement, but is easily defeated by a user selecting Remember Me during login, which still leaves subsequent users logged on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='has%20this%20plugin%20been%20tested%20in%20my%20hosting%20environment%3F'>\nHas this plugin been tested in my Hosting Environment?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The latest version of this plugin was tested and found to work properly in the following Hosting Environments:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The latest version of WordPress with PHP Version 8.2 on both Windows and Linux shared hosting<\/li>\n<li>The latest version of WordPress with PHP Version 7.0 on both Windows and Linux shared hosting<\/li>\n<li>WordPress Version 6.0 with PHP Version 5.6 on Linux shared hosting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note that Version 7.0 is the oldest version of PHP that the current version of WordPress runs on.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20other%20login%20forms%3F'>\nWill this plugin work with other Login forms?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends on whether the <em>other<\/em> Login form provides two standard technical features of the WordPress Login form generated by wp-login.php:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The &#8220;login_form_login&#8221; Action; and<\/li>\n<li>The &#8220;rememberme&#8221; Post field.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Both are used by this plugin.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20security%20am%20i%20sacrificing%20by%20using%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nHow much Security am I sacrificing by using this plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It was a conscious security decision by WordPress developers to always present the standard WordPress Login form with the Remember Me checkbox empty.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, savvy users quickly got into the habit of being sure the Remember Me checkbox was selected every time they logged on. There is a similar risk in office environments where a person steps away from their office computer without <em>locking it<\/em> in the sense of requiring a password be typed to gain access.<\/p>\n<p>The security risk is very dependent on how many registered users will login using a public or other shared computer that does not have an effective mechanism built in for automatically deleting auth cookies when one person finishes and the next begins.  There is a similar risk in office environments where a person steps away from their office computer without <em>locking it<\/em> in the sense of requiring a password be typed to gain access.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the most important security question to ask is:  What level of risk do other people using the same computer as a registered user pose?<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>3.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Check for attempt to directly access admin.php<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested with older versions of WordPress and PHP, and minimum WordPress changed to 6.0 from 6.3<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Defaults to Recommended Settings<\/li>\n<li>Major rewrite of Admin page to meet current WordPress standards<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor support update<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Correct Login &#8220;bizarre behaviour&#8221;
