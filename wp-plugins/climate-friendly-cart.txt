Our goal is to make a measurable impact in the fight against climate change by empowering businesses and individuals to live more sustainably.<\/p>\n<p>We provide easy, one-click carbon offsetting solutions for businesses across the globe to deploy on e-commerce and travel sites. Climate Friendly Cart enables consumers the option and satisfaction in taking instant climate action. All carbon offset contributions support the planet and humanity through projects that reduce or remove CO2 from the atmosphere.<\/p>\n<p>Visit https:\/\/carbonclick.com for more information.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20carbon%20offsets%3F'>\nWhat are Carbon offsets?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Carbon offsets are an effective way to address climate change. When a customer buys a carbon offset it goes towards projects that reduce the carbon in the atmosphere such as funding native forest regeneration or renewable energy.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20customers%20offsetting%20with%20their%20contribution%3F'>\nWhat are customers offsetting with their contribution?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A contribution guarantees they are reducing the environmental impact of their purchase. However, attributing exactly what the offset goes to is hard to pinpoint exactly because of the complex supply chain behind every product. With very high confidence, freight will be offset for most products that use standard courier services for delivery. Furthermore, a meaningful part of the embodied carbon (carbon emissions related to manufacturing the product) will be offset with the remaining amount. If anything is left over after that, then the customer\u2019s contribution is actually making the purchase climate positive \u2013 brilliant!<\/p>\n<p>Here are some items and the typical cost to make them carbon neutral:<\/p>\n<p>Plain T-Shirt: $0.30<br \/>\nTrainers: $0.20<br \/>\nParcel Delivery: $0.05<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20the%20contributions%20go%3F'>\nWhere do the contributions go?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>After we deduct a small margin, the remainder is then split between a local project (if available) and a mix of international projects. Our research shows there\u2019s a strong desire for consumers to offset carbon emissions with local projects. However, local often means expensive so we balance our project \u2018basket\u2019 by including international offsets. This helps to extend the impact of each contribution.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/climate-friendly-cart\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2468395\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/climate-friendly-cart\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2468395\" alt=\"The Green Button in place\"><\/a><p>The Green Button in place<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/climate-friendly-cart\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2468395\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/climate-friendly-cart\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2468395\" alt=\"Track and trace receipt\"><\/a><p>Track and trace receipt<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/climate-friendly-cart\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2468395\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/climate-friendly-cart\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2468395\" alt=\"Our highly customizable Look and Feel tab\"><\/a><p>Our highly customizable Look and Feel tab<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/climate-friendly-cart\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2468395\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/climate-friendly-cart\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2468395\" alt=\"Your cumulative impact dashboard\"><\/a><p>Your cumulative impact dashboard<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/climate-friendly-cart\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2468395\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/climate-friendly-cart\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2468395\" alt=\"Climate Friendly Rewards\"><\/a><p>Climate Friendly Rewards<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Don&#039;t use!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/thisyearsucks\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/bef236d0213cfb82765963c9d2480dc6?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/bef236d0213cfb82765963c9d2480dc6?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/thisyearsucks\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">thisyearsucks<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">January 26, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>so ive downloaded this plugin, you have to plug your credit card details for the installation.
