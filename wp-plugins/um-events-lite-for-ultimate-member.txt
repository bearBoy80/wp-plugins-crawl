With every update you have to be afraid that many new bugs will be installed. If you want to save your money and your nerves should look for alternatives!\nI had bought all the plugins and therefore can not advise anyone to spend their time here. You have to wait months for the promised bug fixes or they are completely ignored.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/um-events-lite-for-ultimate-member.1.0.0.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"events":"events","ultimate-member":"Ultimate Member","ultimate-member-events":"ultimate member events","ultimatemember":"ultimatemember","ultimatemember-events-calendar":"ultimatemember events calendar"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/um-events-lite-for-ultimate-member.1.0.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/um-events-lite-for-ultimate-member.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/suiteplugins.com\/","banners":[]}
