A lot of the other file-based caching plugins were either bundled with other things I didn&#8217;t need (W3 Total Cache), or were old and broken.<\/p>\n<p>On the sites I&#8217;ve tested this with, that have slow database servers, I have noticed an increase in page generation times of about 2x.  On the other hand, for sites that have fast database servers it can actually <em>increase<\/em> page generation time.  Whenever possible, I&#8217;d recommend using Memcached, Redis, or your other quality cache of choice.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been heavily influenced by <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/redis-cache\/\" rel=\"ugc\">redis-cache<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-redis\/\" rel=\"ugc\">wp-redis<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/w3-total-cache\/\" rel=\"ugc\">W3 Total Cache<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Automattic\/wp-memcached\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wp-memcached<\/a> to name a few.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Install like any other plugin, directly from your plugins page or manually by copying the files to the <code>plugins\/<\/code> folder.
