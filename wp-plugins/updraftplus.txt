UpdraftPlus is actively installed on more than 3 million websites around the world.<\/p>\n<h4>Backup with UpdraftPlus<\/h4>\n<p>UpdraftPlus is the world\u2019s highest ranking and most popular scheduled backup and migration plugin. Backup to your preferred storage location and restore in just three clicks.<\/p>\n<p>Backup to Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon S3 (or compatible), Rackspace Cloud, FTP, DreamObjects, Openstack Swift or email.<\/p>\n<p>The paid version also allows you to backup to Microsoft OneDrive, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Backblaze B2, SFTP, SCP, pCloud, WebDAV or UpdraftVault, our integrated storage option for UpdraftPlus.<\/p>\n<p>Backup manually or schedule to run every 2, 4, 8 or 12 hours, daily, weekly, monthly or fortnightly.<\/p>\n<h4>Restore with UpdraftPlus<\/h4>\n<p>Your WordPress website is vulnerable. Your site may get hacked. Something could go wrong with an update or your server could crash. You might need to reverse a change made or a mistake caused by human error.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever the reason, you can restore your WordPress website in just a few clicks with UpdraftPlus. Choose which components to restore (e.g. plugins, themes, database etc.), click again to restore, then click again to return to the main screen.<\/p>\n<h4>Migrate with UpdraftPlus<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to migrate your WordPress website to another web host, server or domain with this free version of UpdraftPlus.<\/p>\n<p>To migrate, simply download your database, plugins, themes etc. from the source site, then upload them into your destination site.<\/p>\n<p>When migrating, a built-in search-and-replace engine identifies old strings and replaces these to reflect the new location. UpdraftPlus saves you time and reduces the risk of broken links or missing files associated with manual migrations.<\/p>\n<h4>Why UpdraftPlus?<\/h4>\n<p>Writing a reliable backup and migration plugin that \u2018just works\u2019 consistently across millions of different WordPress deployments is hard.

Failing that, FTP into the directory wp-content\/updraft and look for it there.<\/p>\n<p>If you know how, please send your PHP error logs &#8211; just the few lines that appear when you run a backup, often the file called error_log, possibly in your wp-admin directory which you can check via FTP. If you\u2019re a programmer that can debug and send a patch, that\u2019s even better.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='when%20it%20comes%20to%20migration%2C%20what%20does%20the%20premium%20plugin%20do%20that%20the%20free%20plugin%20can%27t%3F'>\nWhen it comes to migration, what does the premium plugin do that the free plugin can&#8217;t?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Migrating in the free plugin involves downloading the backups from the source site then uploading these to the destination site.<\/p>\n<p>To find the backup log: there are links to download the logs on the UpdraftPlus settings page- or you may be emailed it. Failing that, FTP into the directory wp-content\/updraft and look for it there.<\/p>\n<p>Both free and Premium plugins include a built-in search-and-replace engine to replace old strings with the new location.<\/p>\n<p>If migration is all you require, and for simple single site migrations the free plugin will likely be enough to meet your needs. If you have additional needs around backups e.g. the ability to backup before updates, if you require more remote storage locations or if you have a WordPress multisite then we recommend UpdraftPlus Premium for the additional benefits that it brings.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='updraftplus%20runs%20out%20of%20time%20when%20it%E2%80%99s%20trying%20to%20backup%2C%20after%20i%20have%20left%20it%20for%20some%20time%20to%20give%20it%20a%20good%20chance.%20what%20can%20i%20do%3F'>\nUpdraftPlus runs out of time when it\u2019s trying to backup, after I have left it for some time to give it a good chance. What can I do?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This problem is probably caused by your account being starved of resources by your (cheap) web host provider. This is far from ideal; although UpdraftPlus supports resuming backup runs right from the beginning to avoid everything having to be done at once, it has its limits. The best thing is to choose a more reputable web host. Failing this, try going into the \u201cExpert settings\u201d and reducing the size at which zip files are split. UpdraftPlus is known to successfully backup websites that run into the multiple-gigabytes on web servers that are not resource-starved.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/updraftplus.com\/news\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">UpdraftPlus backup blog<\/a> is the best place to learn in more detail about any important changes.<\/p>\n<p>N.B.
