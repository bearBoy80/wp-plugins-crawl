It has the benefit of being able to add comments and is more concise than JSON. The generated theme.json is left as a one liner by default, so that you can see it is generated. This however can be changed through the &#8216;theme_yaml_json_pretty_print&#8217; filter.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin automatically looks for a theme.yaml file in the active theme\u2019s root folder when a page is loaded. If found, it will check its last modified time and store the value in the database. If there are new modifications, the plugin parses theme.yaml, converts it to JSON, and writes it to the theme.json file.<\/p>\n<p>If the active theme is a child, it will also automatically run through this process for its parent.<\/p>\n<h3>Configuration<\/h3>\n<p>Add a theme.yaml file with your theme settings in your theme&#8217;s root directory. If you already have an existing theme.json file, you can convert it to the YAML format using an online tool. I personally use https:\/\/www.json2yaml.com\/.
