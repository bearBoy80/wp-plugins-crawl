If you&#8217;ve had a gutful of your website performance being unnecessarily penalised and\/or causing presentation conflicts because of the forced block editor styles, then this this plugin is for you.<\/p>\n<p>FYI: This plugin kills front-end block editor CSS for WordPress core, WooCommerce and the Storefront theme. You&#8217;re welcome.<\/p>\n<p>It goes without saying (I&#8217;ll say it anyway) that if you rely on the block editor for front-end presentation, then steer clear of this plugin.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Just activate this plugin, nothing to configure.<\/li>\n<li>Get on with the rest of your day (optional).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin simply runs a function to dequeue the aforementioned Gutenberg styles from the front-end of your website.
