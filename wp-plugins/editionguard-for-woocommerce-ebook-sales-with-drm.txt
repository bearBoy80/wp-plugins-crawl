Not only would you have to pay for costly server software licenses, you would also need to setup and manage your own IT infrastructure consisting of various expensive server hardware and software software.<\/p>\n<p>Also, the software components of a DRM system are usually quite complex and low-level. What this means is that you\u2019re expected to develop and integrate your own management and business logic layers on top of the DRM system to utilize it comprehensively. While this structure allows for lots of flexibility, we found that most of our clients really want to perform some simple tasks easily, without having to dabble in all the technical details involved.<\/p>\n<p>These are the main reasons we created EditionGuard. We want to provide you with a cost-effective and easy to manage DRM system, while still maintaining the robust and flexible infrastructure present in its core by basing the system on industry standard technologies.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='who%20is%20using%20editionguard%3F'>\nWho is using EditionGuard?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our service is being used by a wide range of eBook publishers, distributors and authors.
