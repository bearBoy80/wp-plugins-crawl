Sometimes, when content is produced dynamically on the front end (the client side), search engine bots have a hard time finding it. With our TDN, you ensure that your translated content will be found.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20it%20work%20with%20my%20theme%20or%20page%20builder%3F'>\nWill it work with my theme or page builder?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We work with all themes.

By default, SiteTran searches for missing translations every 500ms.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20translate%20images%3F'>\nCan I translate images?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!<\/p>\n<p>SiteTran enables you to translate href and src attributes, which means that we can swap out your original images with their translated counterparts. Simply add the URL of your translated image as the translation for the original image&#8217;s URL, and SiteTran handles it for you.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20my%20posts%20and%20pages%20be%20duplicated%20for%20every%20language%3F'>\nWill my posts and pages be duplicated for every language?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.<\/p>\n<p>We make it so that you don&#8217;t need to unnecessarily create and manage lots of additional duplicate posts and pages in your WordPress dashboard for each language.

You can use SiteTran on as many websites as you want, but you should create a new site for each project.
