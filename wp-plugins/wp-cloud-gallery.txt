This means rather than the complex code running on your own server where it can slow down your own server or possibly cause conflict with other plugins and themes, it instead runs on a cloud based servers and worldwide CDN network and the content is remotely displayed in your website using a combination of AJAX and iFrames.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s very similar for example to an embedded YouTube video. YouTube&#8217;s servers handle the complex tasks of rendering the video, paying for the bandwidth, etc. and your browser simply displays the video with virtually no impact on your own server&#8217;s performance.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20purchase%20a%20separate%20upgrade%20for%20each%20website%3F'>\nDo I have to purchase a separate upgrade for each website?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unlike other plugins that charge per website, WP Cloud Gallery can be installed and used on an unlimited number of websites with no restrictions or limits on storage or bandwidth. So whether you manage one or hundreds of websites, one WP Cloud Gallery subscription is all you need.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20it%20work%20with%20all%20themes%3F'>\nWill it work with all themes?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our plugin should work with virtually all WordPress themes. Our plugin is very &#8220;lightweight&#8221; and should not conflict with any other plugins or impact the performance of your overall website.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20often%20is%20the%20content%20updated%3F'>\nHow often is the content updated?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>All galleries updates are updated in realtime. You never have to manually sync or do anything special for your updates to be reflected in your pages.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20limits%20on%20visitors%2C%20bandwidth%2C%20etc.%3F'>\nAre there limits on visitors, bandwidth, etc.?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope! We offer truly unlimited usage! Whether you get one visitor or millions of visitors, our service will display your content from our worldwide network of servers powered by Amazon Web Services with virtually no performance impact on your own hosting service.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.5<\/h4>\n<p>Updated readme and plugin retirement notice<\/p>\n<h4>1.4<\/h4>\n<p>Allow editors to access plugin<\/p>\n<h4>1.3<\/h4>\n<p>Removed support for Instagram due to Instagram API deprecations.<\/p>\n<h4>1.2<\/h4>\n<p>Added Import instructions.<\/p>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<p>Added support for SmugMug, Instagram and YouTube.<\/p>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<p>This is our initial release.<\/p>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Drop Dead Simple and Gorgeous SmugMug Integration<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/bodieq\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0be26164db43727b1bc6ef2f85813d18?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0be26164db43727b1bc6ef2f85813d18?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/bodieq\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">bodieq<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 2, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I am still kind floored at how great these embedded galleries work AND look. I have tried so many ways to embed my SmugMug Galleries into WordPress and I have never seen anything quite like this. Stunning. And the responsive behavior is the best I have ever seen in a photo plugin. Now I can use SmugMug as the home for all my photos, but put them into WordPress exactly how I want.

Developer responded very quickly to initial questions. I look forward to seeing what is coming ahead in features; so far Smugmug, Instagram, and Youtube are available in addition to their very own cloud storage. \n\nIf you're overwhelmed with all the options, features, etc. in some of the other plugins to embed Smugmug galleries - this is worth checking out if you just need the basics and don't want to fuss with all the design aspects. It's fresh, modern, and easy to use.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-cloud-gallery.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"gallery":"gallery","lightbox":"lightbox","portfolio":"portfolio","smugmug":"SmugMug","youtube":"youtube"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-cloud-gallery\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2240763","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-cloud-gallery\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2240763"}}
