It\u2019s exceptionally well documented and supported in our forums.<\/p>\n<p>It allows you to split your single database into 16, 256 or 4096 databases. And if you are using cPanel, it even incorporates a script that will do that for you.<\/p>\n<p>After that, it\u2019ll distribute your blogs around the databases evenly \u2013 giving you peace of mind, much better performance and the confidence to grow your site as much as you desire.<\/p>\n<p>Support Millions of Blogs<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the same solution we use on Edublogs.org and is very similar to that used on WordPress.com.<\/p>\n<p>Increase network performance by spreading your data across multiple databases using Multi-DB.
