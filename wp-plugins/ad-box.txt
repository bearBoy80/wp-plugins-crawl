If you only have a short page or you have made a small browser window then you just need to scroll up and down a bit to get it to \"kick in\". However, this is a detail which affects all free floating boxes.\n\nYou will need to find a balance between the size of the image you use and the text. I have not yet worked out how to format the description text. Again, just a detail.\n\nI think it's a useful and stable widget and I am puzzled that no one seems to be using it!\n\nYour ad will have a footnote \"Powered by Ad Box from Medust\" which seems reasonable enough.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ad-box.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"ad-plugin":"ad plugin","ad-widget":"ad widget","advertising":"advertising","advertising-widget":"advertising widget","customize-ad":"customize ad"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ad-box.1.0.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ad-box\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=1221516","high":false}}
