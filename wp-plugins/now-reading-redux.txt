That is probably the easiest way.

However, before doing that I urge you to look into the CSS and make the most of it, failing that, consider making a suggestion on the plugin homepage and everyone may benefit from your suggestion in an upcoming version.<\/p>\n<p>The second method to control the look and style of NRR is via the CSS script. Starting with version 6.5 library, search and sidebar allow you to write a custom CSS script in the options page. The plugin is highly customizable if you know your CSS. For example, lists are rendered in a table-style (images only) using CSS.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I just updated to the latest version and some stuff got messed up. What&#8217;s up with that?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>With new versions new options are added for ease of use and flexibility. Every effort is done to keep backwards compatibility, however, in some cases this isn&#8217;t possible. It&#8217;s also desirable to cleanup and refactor old options.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid problems and surprises, please revisit the NRR options page after every update. Check your old options and learn about the new ones. Sometimes default values aren&#8217;t set correctly and therefore PHP defaults are effective. This sets some values to false and texts to blank.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is searching for books broken?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you get a warning such as &#8220;URL file-access is disabled in the server configuration&#8221; then you need to edit your PHP.ini file. Searching relies on PHP&#8217;s file_get_contents() function. This function is subject to security permissions. Specifically, allow_url_fopen must be set to &#8216;on&#8217; in PHP.ini (which is the default). More information <a href=\"http:\/\/phpsec.org\/projects\/phpsecinfo\/tests\/allow_url_fopen.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/manual\/en\/function.file-get-contents.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">file_get_contents&#8217;s reference<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/filesystem.configuration.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">allow_url_fopen&#8217;s reference<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Note: Starting from v6.7.0 file_get_contents has been replaced by Snoopy\/cURL controlled from the Options page.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How can I change the number of items shown in the sidebar?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Starting with version 6.5 there is an option that controls the maximum number of books shown for each shelf.<\/p>\n<p>To customize older version, you&#8217;ll have to change the query string in the section in question.<br \/>\nUnder the section heading in question, find the following line (exact values may be different):\n    <\/p>\n<p>This is a PHP function call (named have_books) and the string between the quotes is the query string. To change the number of items returned by this call simply add &#8220;&amp;num=4&#8221; (without the double quotes.) Here I chose to return 4 items, but you can set it to any number. If you set it to -1 you&#8217;ll get all!<\/p>\n<p>Here is how you may set it to return 7 finished books: have_books(&#8216;status=read&amp;orderby=finished&amp;order=desc&amp;num=7&#8217;)<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What are the attributes of nrr_shelf and what are the defaults?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any number of attributes can be used. Leaving out an attribute gives it the default value.<\/p>\n<p>style   =&gt;  &#091;list&#042;, numbered, table&#093;.<br \/>\nstatus  =&gt;  &#091;unread, reading, onhold, read, all&#042;&#093;.<br \/>\norderby =&gt;  &#091;reading, read, onhold, finished&#042;&#093;.<br \/>\norder   =&gt;  &#091;asc, desc&#042;&#093;.<br \/>\nsearch  =&gt;  A substring to match author, title.<br \/>\nauthor  =&gt;  The author to show books by.<br \/>\ntitle   =&gt;  The book title to show.<br \/>\nrating  =&gt;  Book rating Between 1 and 10 inclusive.<br \/>\nreader  =&gt;  The user&#8217;s ID who added the book.<br \/>\nstarted_year    =&gt;  The started year in decimal.<br \/>\nstarted_month   =&gt;  The started month in decimal.<br \/>\nfinished_year   =&gt;  The finished year in decimal.<br \/>\nfinished_month  =&gt;  The finished month in decimal.<br \/>\nnum     =&gt;  The maximum number of items to show. -1 for all (default).<br \/>\nviz     =&gt;  hide, show_text&#042;, show_image, show_image_text.<br \/>\nitems_per_row   =&gt;  Number of books per row.

(Thanks to Alex for this request.)<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Replaced file_get_contents() with url_get_contents() which is based on cURL\/Snoopy and doesn&#8217;t suffer PHP settings. file_get_contents() required enabling allow_url_fopen in php.ini which some servers disallowed. (Thanks to Tom Saunders, TechnoMom, unsicherheitsserver, inktails and others for reporting).<\/li>\n<li>Improved the robustness of Amazon searches, debugging and error-reporting. Also, untitled books are now show with the title &#8220;Untitled&#8221; (previously they were skipped).<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Removed hard-coding of styles from shelf and using CSS class nr_booktitle and nr_bookauthor for the title and author respectively. Also, new classes include nr_viewlibrary, nr_wishlist, nr_nobooks. Apply default CSS styles in NRR options page to get new default styles.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Redesigned templates to use correct and up-to-date styles and better WordPress integration.<\/li>\n<li>New options: Library Title and Wishlist Title options added.<\/li>\n<li>New option: &#8220;Use Theme templatates&#8221; to control whether or not to load theme-specific templates or defaults. Themes can have &#8216;now-reading&#8217; or &#8216;now-reading-redux&#8217; folders added to the TEMPLATEPATH and by enabling this option the templates will be loaded from there. Suffusion makes use of this approach as it has heavily customized templates and the defaults don&#8217;t render so well (although latest templates are much better in this regard.) For Suffusion you&#8217;re advised to copy the templates from NRR&#8217;s suffusion subfolder into Suffusion&#8217;s now-reading subfolder and enable &#8220;Use Theme templates&#8221;. Don&#8217;t forget to repeat this every time you update Suffusion!<\/li>\n<li>Added: NRR shortcode nrr_shelf added. Supports all rendering styles and filtering options supported in the Library page. See FAQ for doc and sample.<\/li>\n<li>Improved book statistics and average reading rate calculation. Statistics may be calculated by books being read per-month as well as books finished per-month (no external option, just internal function implementation).<\/li>\n<li>Improved nrr-generated page-titles shown in the browser caption-bar.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.5.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 3.3 support.<\/li>\n<li>Romanian translation courtesy of Alexander Ovsov <a href=\"http:\/\/webhostinggeeks.com\/science\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Web Geek Sciense<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>New option: Wishlist link.
