There are two settings to control this behaviour, allowing you to choose to add just the PO Number as well as the address if needed.<br \/>\nThe two fields in the Order objects are <code>gazchap_purchase_order_number<\/code> and <code>gazchap_purchase_order_address<\/code> respectively.<br \/>\nThe number is just a string, or <code>null<\/code> if no number was provided (or the payment method was not the Purchase Order gateway)<br \/>\nThe address is an array of strings: <code>contact<\/code>, <code>company<\/code>, <code>address1<\/code>, <code>address2<\/code>, <code>city<\/code>, <code>county<\/code>, <code>postcode<\/code>. These fields can be null if not given.<\/p>\n<p>Note: This plugin does not (currently, at least) generate the actual invoices &#8211; it is only used to collect the Purchase Order information.<\/p>\n<h3>Requirements<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/woocommerce.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce<\/a>, at least version 3.0.<\/p>\n<h3>Usage<\/h3>\n<p>Once installed and activated, you need to enable the Payment Gateway in <em>WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Checkout<\/em> (or via the plugin&#8217;s Settings link on the WordPress Plugins page) &#8211; you can then set the various options for the plugin at the same time.<\/p>\n<h3>License<\/h3>\n<p>Licensed under the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/gpl-2.0.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GNU General Public License v2.0<\/a><\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Install via the WordPress Plugin Directory, or download a release from this repository and install as you would a normal WordPress plugin.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>3.1 (24\/05\/2023)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug with the PO details being removed from the WooCommerce Order when the status (and other information) is updated via the admin screens.
