You can learn more on <a href=\"http:\/\/ace.ajax.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ace.ajax.org<\/a> or on its <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/ajaxorg\/ace\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">github page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Are there any known issues?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you try to edit the Ace Edit plugin itself (with the plugin active), Google Chrome will fall back to the default textarea after saving the plugin. This is due to Chrome\u2019s security features which refuse to run any JavaScript that was just part of a POST request sent to the current page.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What about planned features?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>While we try to keep Ace Editor as lightweight as possible, we will introduce a settings page in near future to let users choose one of the included themes for syntax highlighting and set options like word wrap, hidden characters and more.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>enabled syntax highlighting for JavaScript files<\/li>\n<li>updated ace.js to latest version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ace-edit\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1590999\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ace-edit\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1590999\" alt=\"Theme Editor\"><\/a><p>Theme Editor<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ace-edit\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1590999\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ace-edit\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1590999\" alt=\"Plugin Editor\"><\/a><p>Plugin Editor<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Very handy<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/inspired888\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b859830cb6efcb8b45954db34e920e34?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b859830cb6efcb8b45954db34e920e34?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/inspired888\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">inspired888<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 31, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Thanks for this excellent IDE for WordPress. I saw there were only two ratings (both 5 stars), and felt you needed another. I can't believe this plugin has been maintained for over 4 years, and there's only two reviews and around 400 users.\nSo here's another FIVE STARS from this user. Great work. Thanks for maintaining this despite the relatively low interest in it. I guess most users don't want a decent editor in WordPress?<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ace-edit.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ace-edit\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1590999","caption":"Theme Editor"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ace-edit\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1590999","caption":"Plugin Editor"}},"tags":{"ace":"ace","code-editor":"code editor","ide":"ide"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ace-edit.1.0.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
