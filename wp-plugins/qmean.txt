QMean leverages Google&#8217;s browser API URL to fetch suggestions, making it a completely free-to-use plugin.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20differences%20between%20qmean%20and%20google%27s%20suggestion%20engine%3F'>\nWhat are the differences between QMean and Google&#8217;s suggestion engine?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>In general, QMean collects relevant keywords from your website&#8217;s content and database, and then offers suggestions based on this data. On the other hand, Google&#8217;s suggestion engine relies on the most relevant keywords determined by its ranking algorithms. The key distinctions between the two lie in speed and relevancy. Google suggests fast and QMean suggests relevant.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20shortcode%3F'>\nWhat is the shortcode?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two shortcodes. One for search form and the other to show suggestions. You can read more in <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/arashsafaridev\/qmean\/wiki\/get-started\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">QMean&#8217;s wiki<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20difference%20of%20phrase%20mode%20or%20word%20by%20word%20mode%3F'>\nWhat is the difference of Phrase mode or Word by Word mode?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Word by word mode will look for the most related keyword for each word. For example, if you are looking for &#8220;Hoodie With Logo&#8221;,  it will search for suggestion based on active word. First for hoodie, then for with, and finally for logo.<br \/>\nBut for the  Phrase mode, it will look for related keywords on the whole phrase. For example, when your finishing &#8220;Hoodie With Logo&#8221; It will provide the suggestions on completion, for the whole phrase.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='which%20mode%20is%20better%3F'>\nWhich mode is better?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Both of them are useful. It depends on your need. Phrase mode can have solid results at the end but fewer suggestions. But WBW can have more suggestions and fewer results because it will suggest the most related keyword from the entire database! it can be useful to optimize your SEO (if user created that phrase and you didn&#8217;t predicted it, it is not QMeans&#8217;s fault \ud83d\ude42 )<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First Launch<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Limit number of suggested keywords<\/li>\n<li>Smarter suggestions!
