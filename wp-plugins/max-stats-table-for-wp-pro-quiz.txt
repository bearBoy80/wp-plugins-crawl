The statistics displayed are nearly identical to those generated by WP Pro Quiz when viewed in the WordPress Administration Console.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, the WP Pro Quiz plugin must be installed and activated or Max Stats Table will not work.<\/p>\n<p>A short-code called [wppq-max-stats] is provided so that the user can display the statistics tables on a page on the website.  The page can be password protected or set to &#8220;private&#8221; with no negative effects on the plugin.  From this page, a user can view all the statistics for all tests set up in WP Pro Quiz.  Also available is a &#8220;one-click delete&#8221; button that will delete all statistics from the WP Pro Quiz stats tables thereby &#8220;resetting&#8221; the quizzes to zero.  Only site administrators have access to the delete button.<\/p>\n<p>Future development on this plugin may introduce features such as displaying the same set of tables in the WordPress Admin Console so that no public-side page is needed and \/ or capturing MySQL errors (if any) and displaying them to the user.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>1.)  Install and activate plugin through WordPress administration console just as you would any other plugin.<br \/>\n2.)  Insert the short-code [wppq-max-stats] into any page where you would like the statistics tables to be generated.<br \/>\n3.)  Navigate to that page and view the tables.<\/p>\n","faq":"<p>Q:  What statistics are shown in the stats table?<br \/>\nA:  Each quiz gets its own stats table.  For each stats table, all WordPress users as well as one &#8220;anonymous&#8221; user are listed with Total Points, Correct Answers, Incorrect Answers, and Percentage Correct values displayed for each.<\/p>\n<p>Q:  Are any of the usernames linked to the question lists like in the WP Pro Quiz statistics tables?<br \/>\nA:  Nope.<\/p>\n<p>Q:  Can the user clear the statistics from this plugin like you can when viewing the tables in WP Pro Quiz?<br \/>\nA:  Yes.  There is a button at the top of the Max Stats page that will truncate the statistics tables.  This will reset \/ clear all statistics for all quizzes.  Only site Admins have access to this feature.<\/p>\n<p>Q:  What options are available in this plugin?  Can I change any settings?<br \/>\nA:  Not currently.  If there&#8217;s some setting that you feel you need to change then make a comment in the &#8220;support&#8221; section and we can talk about it.<\/p>\n<p>Q:  What happens if I don&#8217;t have the WP Pro Quiz Plugin installed?<br \/>\nA:  Max Stats Table will not work.  It will install correctly and it will behave itself but if you try to use the short-code you will see an error message notifying you of the missing WP Pro Quiz plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Q:  Does this plugin work with any other quiz or test plugins?<br \/>\nA:  Not that I&#8217;m aware.  I suppose that some ridiculously small possibility exists that another quiz plugin might have the same database table structure as WP Pro Quiz and therefore <em>some<\/em> kind of data may be generated&#8230;but I highly doubt it.<\/p>\n<p>Q:  Are you going to make this plugin work with other quiz \/ test plugins?<br \/>\nA:  Nope.<\/p>\n<p>Q:  Why did you code a plugin for a 5-year-old test engine whose author has not responded to emails or support requests for the last 3 years?<br \/>\nA:  Necessity.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<p>3.2.1<br \/>\n&#8211;Realized that the &#8220;Delete All Statistics&#8221; button was appearing even when WP Pro Quiz was not installed.
