This page is nested within &#8220;Tools&#8221;.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nWhat does it do?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It allows you to create simple Backups from your Backend containing: Active Theme, Database, Uploads. The generated Archive can then be downloaded and stored on your local drives. After downloading, the plugin allows easy flushing of the server-side files.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nCan the Backups also be stored on the server?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is not advised for two reasons: first) when your Hosting\/Server breaks, a server-side backup might go down with it and second) the sql-dump contains usernames for your wordpress installation, hence it must not be permanently stored on the server<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nWhy are Plugins not backed up?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugins are a vital part of many WordPress Installations, which makes them prime candidates for a backup. However, there are a couple of reasons not to include them: a) They outdate quickly, making a backed up Version easily obsolete, b) Plugins can get  large and in quantity would slow down Backups considerably, c) They must not include custom code and therefore can easily be re-downloaded in current or older Versions from the repository. This plugin can generate a plain-text list of currently active Plugins with their respective Version-Number and the Plugin-URI.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nWhy is there no way to schedule Backups?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This Plugin was designed around the idea of having a simple tool to create small Backups before updating WordPress. Scheduled and automatic Backups are currently not planned. If you&#8217;re looking for something like that, I suggest looking elsewhere.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.11<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility with WP 5.5<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.10<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugfix<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed Plugin not showing up in WordPress Tools Menu<\/li>\n<li>Compatibility with WP 5.3<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor text fixes<\/li>\n<li>Compatibility with WP 4.8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>added text domain and domain path to plugin meta data<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility with WP 4.6<\/li>\n<li>fixed some php errors provided by adampatterson (thanks)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility with WP 4.5<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility with WP 4.3<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a small Error with the Plugin URI displayed in the Footer<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Using shuttle export by 2createStudio for SQL Export:<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/2createStudio\/shuttle-export<\/li>\n<li>Removed custom export code<\/li>\n<li>Fixed some typos<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin will check whether system() is enabled and deactivate the SQL-Dump if not<\/li>\n<li>Removed manual SQL Dump, too many possibilities of incomplete dumps<\/li>\n<li>Reordered components<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the workflow of generating Backups: Instead of creating separate ZIPs for each component, the Plugin will now generate a single ZIP and add the requested parts to this single Archive.
