I&#8217;d used spreadsheets in the past, but I wanted a way to make that information public on my website so I created this.<\/p>\n<p>For now, it&#8217;s pretty much hard coded for NaNoWriMo, but in the future I plan on adding the option to allow it to be used for ScriptFrenzy and NaNoEdMo too.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>nanorc.php<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>You should see a new tab on your Dashboard page where you can enter your word count data<\/li>\n<li>If you want to add a quick summary of your novel to your sidebar and your theme supports widgets you should see a NaNo Report Card widget in the list of available widgets<\/li>\n<li>To create a page with a report card use the tag <code>&lt;?php nanorc_report(); ?&gt;<\/code>, likewise to add a graph use <code>&lt;?php nanorc_graph(); ?&gt;<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"<h4>Can I use this for ScriptFrenzy, NaNoEdMo, or some other similar event?<\/h4>\n<p>Absolutely!  For now all the text in the plugin makes the most sense with NaNoWriMo or other events with wordcount goals, but I&#8217;m working on creating an updated version that allows more customization for use with ScriptFrenzy, EdMo, and others.<\/p>\n<h4>Where can I go to learn about the tags available?<\/h4>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working on getting some documentation together on my website.
