This plugin is an add-on to Tickera&#8217;s functionality. By default Tickera sends email only to buyer of the tickets. This add-on plugin adds functionality to send tickets to attendees (ticket owner) as well. Attendee will receive a link to his\/her own ticket only via an email. The email template is hard coded right now. If you guys need to customize the template, reach out. I will add admin menu page from where you can customize the email template to be sent. For this add-on plugin to work you should have Tickera plugin installed and &#8220;Tickera &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Show Ticket Attendee Fields&#8221; set to YES.<\/p>\n<p>In case you face difficulties in email delivery (email not delivered or delivered to junk), I recommend you use a plugin like Easy WP STMP.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>First purchase, install and activate Tickera (by Tickera.com) https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/tickera-event-ticketing-system\/<\/li>\n<li>Once Tickera is active, Go To &#8220;Tickera &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Show Ticket Attendee Fields&#8221; and set it to YES.
