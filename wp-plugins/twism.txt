It's unique and allows to to market your Rewards Program as such. You can customize your digital coin with your icon, etc. There are a lot of different option also such as Refer and Earn, earning bonus coins for sharing\/liking your social media pages and customers can even purchase the coins. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only CON that needs to be fixed: On WP\/Woo the plugin takes over the store connection step for all plugins. IE, when you attempt to activate another plugin the Twism connect and authorize pops instead. I had to uninstall it until (I thought) I was done installing plugins for awhile. This will be cumbersome for future plugin installs.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/twism.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/twism\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2811481","caption":"Loyalty"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/twism\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2811481","caption":"Customize"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/twism\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2811481","caption":"Rewards"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/twism\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2811481","caption":"Physical location also"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/twism\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2811481","caption":"Customer intelligence"}},"tags":{"businesses":"businesses","customers":"customers","loyalty":"Loyalty","rewards":"Rewards","sales":"sales"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/twism.1.0.0.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/twism\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2811481","high":false}}
