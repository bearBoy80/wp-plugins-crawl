The View My Posts Alone plugin is specially designed for those who have many authors(contributors) or allow guest posts, custom user roles to acces their blogs\/articles. In WordPress, a contributor can write as much blogs and articles as they can and submit it and wait for review (i.e) to be published from the administrator or the Person who is incharge of doing these things.  But at the time when the contributor or the custom user role member visits the posts section or the custom post type he\/she can see all the posts that has been presented in that site. If that happens there is no privacy for the contributors to write up their article and put up in the blog.<\/p>\n<p>Inorder to overcome this type of problems alone this plugin has been written and it is very successfull even for lots of users in that blog. It will restrict the posts or the CPT to view only the posts that has been published or which has been saved as draft by that user alone. It will never display other persons writeups onto the Dashboard of the Others.<\/p>\n<p>The Administrator and the Blog Author can view all the posts that are being contributed to their site and confirm what are all the posts that can be published  and what not to be published.<\/p>\n<p>On the whole this will be fantastic for the Users who are onto the Blogging and make things secret from the other writers.<\/p>\n<p>I wrote this plugin since I am in search of this plugin desperately but very unfortunate am unable to find the plugin which satisfy my needs and requirements and that has ended up me in creating this plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Plugin Features<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to Install.<\/li>\n<li>No Settings Required.<\/li>\n<li>It can be used for both the Normal Post type as well as the Custom Post Type too.<\/li>\n<li>For Custom post type you have to add the CPT to the Plugin file.<\/li>\n<li>Ease of Use in Multi Blogging Sites.<\/li>\n<li>Very Effective.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Direclty Download the plugin from the WordPress Plugin Repository itself by Downlaoding the Plugin through the Direct Plugin Download available in the Plugins Section by searcing the plugin&#8217;s name.
