Not a Wiki <em>per se<\/em>, as it&#8217;s not intented to be collaborative (although it can be), rather, it just uses Custom Post Types to separate documentation articles from the rest of your content. This plugin came as a result of my undying hatred of MediaWiki.  I know BBCode and HTML and PHP and CSS and still the wiki markup just baffles me.  I can never remember how to do the <em>simplest<\/em> things, like create a freaking link.  Really?  All I want to do is throw a <code>&lt;a href=\"...\"&gt;<\/code> in there.  If you&#8217;re looking at this plugin, you know what I&#8217;m talking about.  When this plugin was written the WordPress plugins available for what I want to do either <em>aren&#8217;t<\/em> what I want to do, or don&#8217;t work with the latest version of WordPress.  Hence this plugin.<\/p>\n<p><em>WordPress Wiki That Doesn&#8217;t Suck<\/em> uses custom post types.  And that&#8217;s pretty much it.  It creates a new custom post type (<code>wpwtds_article<\/code>) that can be accessed from the <em>Wiki != suck<\/em> menu it adds to your sidebar (!= is &#8220;not equal to&#8221; in coder jargon).  Wiki articles are posted with the <code>wiki<\/code> slug, so your URLs will look like <code>http:\/\/mydomain.com\/wiki\/my-cool-article<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>To display your wiki articles on a page, you can either use the included template files (in the <code>\/templates<\/code> directory), or you can use the <code>[wpwtds]<\/code> shortcode that&#8217;s been added in 0.9.<\/p>\n<p>You can see WPWTDS in action at http:\/\/museumthemes.com\/wiki\/ and http:\/\/eventespresso.com\/support\/documentation\/<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Unpack the zip file and upload to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory or use the Add New Plugin option in WordPress to install.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the <em>Plugins<\/em> menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Start writing articles!<\/li>\n<li>Use the <code>[wpwtds]<\/code> shortcode or the included template file examples to display a list of wiki articles on your page.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Can I change the default slug?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why isn&#8217;t *x* feature included?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Basically, I had a specific need, custom post types seemed like the best answer.  Plus, once it was done, I couldn&#8217;t think of anything else it really needed.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>This isn&#8217;t a *wiki* really, is it?  I mean, there&#8217;s no real way to contribute like a real Wiki&#8230;<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This wasn&#8217;t a concern for me, since I just wanted someplace I could post support docs that was public.  That said, generic WordPress user roles will still work, so if you&#8217;re an <em>Author<\/em> you&#8217;ll be able to post new wiki articles, same as anything else.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve installed it, now what?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>After you install the plugin, wiki articles will use your theme&#8217;s default <code>single.php<\/code> template file.  You may want to actually <em>use<\/em> your wiki, as in have an actual wiki page, and for that, you&#8217;ll either need to add a custom template to your theme or use the <code>[wpwtds]<\/code> shortcode. To use the shortcode, all you need to do is add <code>[wpwtds]<\/code> on a post or a page and it will display a list of all your wiki articles.<\/p>\n<p>A default template that you can use is provided if you want to customize the layout. More than likely you&#8217;ll need to modify it slightly to fit your specific theme.<\/p>\n<p>The best reference I can give you for working with custom post types (if you wanted to make your own wiki main page, for instance) is the <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Custom_Post_Types\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Custom Post Types<\/a> article in the <a href=\"http:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Codex<\/a>.  The only thing you need to know is that the post types are identified as <code>wpwtds_article<\/code>s.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<p><strong>Version 0.9.2<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>fixes undefined index notice on edit wiki pages<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Version 0.9.1<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>adds post thumbnail support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Version 0.9<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>added shortcode to list all wiki articles without having to code anything.
