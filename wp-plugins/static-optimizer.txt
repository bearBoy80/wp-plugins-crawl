You can also select js, &amp; css files to be optimized as well.<br \/>\nThe first time our servers get a file it will be downloaded and optimized. Because this operation can take several seconds<br \/>\nyour users will be redirected back to the original file that was requested. Any subsequent requests will be served from our servers.<\/p>\n<h4>Who is this plugin for?<\/h4>\n<p>People who have lots of images on their site such online stores, photographers, real estate agents.<\/p>\n<h4>Thanks<\/h4>\n<p>The logo was designed by Atanas Lambev &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/dralart.com\" title=\"Web Design Bulgaria, Logo design bulgaria\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/dralart.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to express my gratitude to the people who have taken the time to test the plugin &amp; make suggestions and\/or has provided access to troubleshoot glitches.<br \/>\n* Phil Ryan &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/site123.ca\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/site123.ca<\/a><br \/>\n* Michel Veenstra &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adventis.nl\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/www.adventis.nl<\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>and to many more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Support<\/h3>\n<p>Bugs?
