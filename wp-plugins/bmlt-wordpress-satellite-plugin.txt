This was an important capability that was left out after Version 3.X<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a CSS issue with the admin display map.

This is the first fruit of the new structure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.18<\/h4>\n<p>June 20, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an &#8220;invisible&#8221; bug in the standard header output, which could interfere with the correct settings being selected.<\/li>\n<li>Changed the structure to use the new one that allows the shared projects to be &#8220;nested&#8221; more easily.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.17<\/h4>\n<p>June 14, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the location text and comments to the meeting info displays in mobile mode.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.16<\/h4>\n<p>May 24, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moved the AJAX handler to the &#8220;init&#8221; phase, as &#8216;wp&#8217; seemed to wait a bit too long.<\/li>\n<li>Added the capability to display a changelist in the upgrade notice -very cool!<\/li>\n<li>Added a settings link to the plugin listing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.15<\/h4>\n<p>May 22, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a very strange bug that seems to cause error 500s on some servers. Not sure why the fix worked, but it does. This only manifested when doing an &#8220;address only&#8221; search in mobile mode.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.14<\/h4>\n<p>May 18, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug that prevents the &#8220;More Details&#8221; window from being shown.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.13<\/h4>\n<p>May 16, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a minor bug that prevented the popup menu and the classic interactive search from being displayed on the same page (this is OK to happen).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.12<\/h4>\n<p>May 8, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an error that interfered with several Advanced Search options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.11<\/h4>\n<p>May 7, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a JavaScript error that prevented saves.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.10<\/h4>\n<p>May 6, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added changes to the cross-CMS class and styling for the Drupal module. Won&#8217;t have much effect on WordPress.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.9<\/h4>\n<p>May 3, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a few issues encountered while implementing the Drupal plugin (a lot of the code is cross-CMS).<\/li>\n<li>Added GPL headers to everything.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.8<\/h4>\n<p>April 28, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug, in which the bmlt_mobile shortcode was not being interpreted properly (Affected WordPress only).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.7<\/h4>\n<p>April 26, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a rather severe bug in the shortcode substitution, that prevented multiple shortcodes from working on the same page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.6<\/h4>\n<p>April 24, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic code cleanup.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a couple of minor cosmetic bugs in the admin JavaScript and CSS.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.5<\/h4>\n<p>April 23, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oops. One more warning-spitter snuck through. It&#8217;s fixed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.4<\/h4>\n<p>April 23, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a minor JS bug in the option submit. It did not result in errors, per se, but caused extra text to be transmitted.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.3<\/h4>\n<p>April 21, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Addressed some issues that could cause problems on some servers (a screwy intval() implementation).<\/li>\n<li>Made the save settings use POST, as the size of the transaction can be too large for GET, when you have a lot of settings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.2<\/h4>\n<p>April 20, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed some warnings that interfered with the operation of 2.1.1<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.1<\/h4>\n<p>April 20, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sequestered the mobile stuff into a fieldset in the admin.<\/li>\n<li>Added the ability to set the mobile &#8220;grace period,&#8221; as well as specify a mobile offset from the server.<\/li>\n<li>Added a number of fixes and adjustments as we debugged the Joomla plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1<\/h4>\n<p>April 11, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Significant refactoring to make it easier to port the plugin to other CMSes.<\/li>\n<li>Added the ability to select distance units (Km or Mi). This will only affect the mobile handler (at the moment).<\/li>\n<li>Added the ability to project a language, via the original interactive search (You can select a different language from the server&#8217;s default).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.2<\/h4>\n<p>March 3, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a critical problem that appeared in 2.0.1 because of a silly error on the coders&#8217; part.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.1<\/h4>\n<p>March 3, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a JavaScript issue that prevented the options from being displayed in Firefox.<\/li>\n<li>Added null parameters to some get_page() calls to prevent warnings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.0<\/h4>\n<p>February 21, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Release.<\/li>\n<li>Added the GNYR theme to the release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.0RC1<\/h4>\n<p>February 20, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a number of issues encountered during beta testing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.0B0<\/h4>\n<p>February 14, 2011*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Major rewrite. You can now have multiple settings, which can include different servers.<\/li>\n<li>You can &#8220;theme&#8221; the displays.<\/li>\n<li>We no longer support non-JS browsers.<\/li>\n<li>Mobile content has been woven into the plugin. It now allows the page to be replaced with the fast mobile lookup, if that was requested.<\/li>\n<li>The administration has been drastically improved.<\/li>\n<li>This provides an infrastructure for many future improvements. The 2.0 release was aimed primarily at transitioning from the old system into the new.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.12<\/h4>\n<p>October 2, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very, very minor change to a text display to make the plugin easier to localize.<\/li>\n<li>Changed the CSS so that the plugin will adapt more efficiently to different environments.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.11<\/h4>\n<p>September 18, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for some new initial screen modes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.10<\/h4>\n<p>September 4, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a bit of default CSS to make the search specification screen more adaptable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.9<\/h4>\n<p>August 30, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure that all cURL calls are GET, as some servers don&#8217;t like POST.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.8<\/h4>\n<p>July 23, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for a readable-text meta tag entry ([[BMLT]]).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.7<\/h4>\n<p>July 1, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stopped the plugin from croaking the whole shooting match if call_curl fails (Wrap in empty try block).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.6<\/h4>\n<p>June 1, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Made it so that lookups for individual meetings don&#8217;t get redirected to the root server.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.5<\/h4>\n<p>May 30, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added JS and Style optimizers for the linked files.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a bug in the new selector.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.4<\/h4>\n<p>May 29, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Embedded the simple search feature into the plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.3<\/h4>\n<p>May 28, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added provision to allow the CMS direct access to the simple dump.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.2<\/h4>\n<p>April 23, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an old bug that could affect the way the server interaction works (curl).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.1<\/h4>\n<p>April 23, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added some code to ensure the root server URI has a trailing slash.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5<\/h4>\n<p>April 2, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for the &#8220;simple&#8221; inline meeting tables.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.2<\/h4>\n<p>February 21, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Execute the PDF check earlier, as other plugins can interfere.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.1<\/h4>\n<p>February 16, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for Android<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4<\/h4>\n<p>February 14, 2010*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for iPhone<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a minor issue with the cURL caller.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.19<\/h4>\n<p>December 30, 2009*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the ability to switch on a &#8220;push in&#8221; method of viewing the &#8220;More Details&#8221; window.<\/li>\n<li>Added the ability for the admin to insert arbitrary CSS styles.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.18<\/h4>\n<p>November 24, 2009*<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a section of documentation for administration.
