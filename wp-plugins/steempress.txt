And generally more pretty.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody says &#8220;hey have you heard of 173.245.234.11 ?&#8221; they say &#8220;hey have you heard of mysuperblog.com ?&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I use a free domain or a subdomain ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How can I protect the SEO of my website\/will the SEO of my blog be affected ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The delay feature allow you to publish first on your blog and then publish to hive after a few days\/hours\/minutes (you decide the delay). Which means that google and other search engines will index your blog first and tag hive.blog as a duplicate. And so your blog&#8217;s seo ranking won&#8217;t be hurt.<br \/>\nWe recommend a 7 days delay for maximum security.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I did not get a vote on my article, is something wrong ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will not automatically get a vote, consider a vote as a tip for producing good content with us. You don&#8217;t expect<br \/>\na tip, but you are happy when you get one. The same mentality applies.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Who do I talk to about business and parnerships ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Find @fredrikaa on the official steempress discord and talk to him<\/p>\n<p>the discord can be found here : https:\/\/discord.gg\/W2KyAbm<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Who do I talk to about technical details, bugs etc ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>don&#8217;t talk to @howo directly unless it&#8217;s a very specific and urgent problem, instead feel free to use the<br \/>\nhelp and suggestion channels.<\/p>\n<p>Still on the discord : https:\/\/discord.gg\/W2KyAbm<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I published my post on wordpress but it was not published on hive what&#8217;s up ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check the plugin settings to make sure that you have set everything correctly. you should see<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Connectivity to the hive server : Ok<br \/>\nUsername\/posting key : Ok<br \/>\n&#8220;<\/p>\n<p>If that&#8217;s ok, look at the delay, did you put any delay ? And is that delay over ?<\/p>\n<p>If all of that checks, then something went wrong, come in the #help channel and we&#8217;ll figure it out.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I use this on my phone<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We got that question a lot so I feel like we need to answer it.<\/p>\n<p>No. You need a wordpress blog which needs to be hosted. So you can buy hosting with your phone and manage it<br \/>\nstill from your phone but you&#8217;ll have to go by the &#8220;hosting&#8221; section and get a blog there.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>At what percentages are the beneficiaries set  ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>15%<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Benefactor rewards<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Like most other apps on hive, including esteem, dtube, dsound, dmania and zappl to name a few, Swe use benefactor rewards to help run and develop SteemPress. The benefactor reward is currently set to 15%. To compensate, SteemPress is able to support original authors who post quality content with our hive account @steempress-io.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">well... it WAS good<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/daniarnold\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b7ba7b15be28aa73953eb69688a63655?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b7ba7b15be28aa73953eb69688a63655?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/daniarnold\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">daniarnold<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 12, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Apparently this plugin doesn't work anymore.

As it is for us to cross over when we are ready.\n\nSteempress creates a uni- or bi-directional bridge between Wordpress blogs and Steem.\n\nThe bi-directional bridge needs to be activated by adding the comments widget from Steempress. Comments will come from both your audience on the Wordpress blog and from users who see your post on Steem. Votes (having a value in STEEM) come from Steem users, so you will also add an additional income flow to your blog if you activate it.\n\nI recently used the comments widget to both upvote the post and leave a comment and it works as expected! I also used the uni-directional bridge to publish posts from my blog to Steem.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">It&#039;s a huge help, but not perfect and take 15%<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"4 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"4\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/cpishon\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/15cd0e93f539a4e3ddc6885eb93d57ef?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/15cd0e93f539a4e3ddc6885eb93d57ef?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/cpishon\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">cpishon<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 9, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This plugin helps me manage my schedule between posting to my blog and to Steemit. But there are some formatting issues from time to time, especially with video or animated gifs. I've had to correct them in Steemit after posting. \n\nThose aren't a big deal though. The bigger issue is that they set themselves as a 15% beneficiary. The reason why that's an issue is it isn't stated anywhere. I only saw it after I got a Curie vote and didn't get as much as I thought I should. I looked on Steemworld and saw how they had taken the 15%. \n\nThe thing is, I don't mind supporting a good product BUT I want to be told how it works. If it is written anywhere on the plugin description or on the settings or wherever, I can't find it. Something like this should be big and bold so there's no confusion or hard feelings. \n\nI'd rather it were a slider for support too. Some might give 0% but others might like it so much they give 50% - you never know! But in any case, developers please make the beneficiary setting very obvious to anyone before they download it, and also make sure it's clear in the plugin info after installation. \n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">good<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/sanhtun\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/cac24c604d7738d469dd343645027710?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/cac24c604d7738d469dd343645027710?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/sanhtun\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">sanhtun<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 20, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">this is very good<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Doesn&#039;t Work<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"4 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"4\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/leonoxme\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/94e10e75cae89aefe1757418eeb9c1db?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/94e10e75cae89aefe1757418eeb9c1db?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/leonoxme\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">leonoxme<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 26, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Initially I had some pre-existing posts that I wanted published. Thanks to dev help, used Bulk Actions in WP to manually push these to be published on STEEM. I manually publish 3 posts, two of them eventually get published 5 days apart. The third hasn't published at all 10 days later.\n\nNow that my \"Delay Post\" timer has arrived for all my newer posts, none of my new posts have been published. Delay value is set at 7200 (5 days). Have articles that haven't been published which are upwards of 21 days old.\n\nNeeds to have some kind of local transaction log to see which articles have been submitted for publishing to the blockchain. Will continue testing a possibility on my end as to why this is occurring.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Not Perfect but Very Good!

Steemit is an awesome platform but there are still pretty bare. Hence, being able work directly from WP and get my posts published on both platforms is a <strong>major boost for productivity<\/strong>.\n\nWhile it's a fantastic plugin it's not yet perfect for a few reasons:\n\n1) This plugin is very new. Steem is very new! This is pretty much still in a \"work in progress\" project. \n\n<strong>The devs are working very hard and responsive to feedbacks!)<\/strong>\n\n2) There are some difference in the presentation and backend structure about Steemit that makes it more difficult to be 100% seamless.\n\nI believe that with more users' feedback .. and given some time it will evolve\n\nWell done Howo and Fred!!\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/steempress.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"blockchain":"blockchain","hive":"hive","monetization":"monetization","wordpress":"WordPress"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"https:\/\/hive.blog\/@howo","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/steempress\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1891251","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/steempress\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1891247"}}
