Others allow me to place the shortcode in my post-meta and have it appear on archive loops; this one, nothing until you're viewing the single post. #Bummer.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/timespan.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"blog":"blog","length":"length","post":"post","reading":"reading","time":"time"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/timespan\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=999409","high":false}}
