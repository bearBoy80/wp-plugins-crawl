The plugin is a tool to select a Chinese and English font stack to target  HTML heading tags (H1-H6) and the HTML body tag. This works for multi-language websites in Chinese and English and also provides an English font fallback for numbers and and English words on native Chinese sites.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin is developed by Grafica Real, a Beijing website design and development company.<\/p>\n<h3>PHP Documentation<\/h3>\n<p>Plugin is adding submenu to Appearance bucket with name WP Sinotype. The internal id is &#8216;sinotype_config&#8217;<br \/>\nPlugin is working with 4 variables which are saved in WP table &#8216;options&#8217; 1. 2. 3. 4. sinotype_heading_cn ? value of Chinese font for Headings sinotype_heading_en ? value of English font for Headings sinotype_body_cn ? value of Chinese font for body text sinotype_body_en ? value of English font for body text<\/p>\n<p>All values are simple string, which is CSS code for selected font-family<br \/>\nThe \/\/ === Experimental === \/\/ Section is under development and has no impact on plugin functionality<br \/>\nWhile submitting selected fonts there is a IF statement for custom English heading font<br \/>\nAll fonts used in plugin are filled in 2 arrays.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>st_fonts_cn ? Array of Chinese fonts <\/li>\n<li>st_fonts_en ? Array of English fonts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Both Array structure is: Array(0=&gt;Array(&#8216;font css code&#8217;,&#8217;front end title&#8217;), 0=&gt;Array(&#8216;font css code&#8217;,&#8217;front end title&#8217;)); Example: Array(0=&gt;Array(&#8216;Arial&#8217;,&#8217;Arial&#8217;), 0=&gt;Array(&#8216;sans-serif&#8217;,&#8217;Sans Serif&#8217;));<br \/>\nFonts can be freely added to the arrays without any inpact on functionality.<br \/>\nWhile loading the actual website, plugin inserts at the end of header  section where it rewrites the font-family set before, for h1 ? h6 and body.<\/p>\n<p>In Detail:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>body {font-family:values;} ? Rewrites the font-family for the whole body element<\/li>\n<li>h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6{font-family:values;} ? Rewrites the font-family for h1 ? h6 elements<\/li>\n<li>h1&gt;<em>,h2&gt;<\/em>,h3&gt;<em>,h4&gt;<\/em>,h5&gt;<em>,h6&gt;<\/em>{font-family:values;} ? Rewrites font-family of all elements inside of H1 ? H6 elements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In case of setting h1 ? h6 font family by a class, plugin will not work. For example the html code is<\/p>\n<p>Hello World!<\/p>\n<p>and CSS is : .heading{font-family:Georgia;} In this case plugin cannot rewrite font-family of H1 element.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use this plugin, WP theme in use MUST have  in header.php file, and it must be placed just before  tag.<\/p>\n<h3>Javascript Documentation<\/h3>\n<p>Javascript in plugin is used for Live preview of selected font-families (excluding English custom font).<br \/>\nScript used in this plugin is based on jQuery Javascript library, therefore this library must be used.<br \/>\nAt first load Javascript scan which fonts are selected (loaded from database by php) and set those font to live preview.<br \/>\nAfter setting first load fonts, Javascript is listening to the select boxes and once user select other font Javascript changes live preview css to desired font-family.<br \/>\nCase of broken javascript has no inpact on functionality of the plugin, Javascript is used only for live preview of fonts.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the WP SinoType plugin folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Apply your font settings in the WP SinoType settings and click &#8216;Save&#8217;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>My fonts are not appearing, what is wrong?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some possible reasons for fonts not appearing are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The font that is not appearing is a Mac font and you are on a Windows machine, or vies versa.<\/li>\n<li>Your targeting HTML tag has a CSS class applied to it with a font-family applied to it.<\/li>\n<li>Try clearing your cache<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I add contribute or add fonts to the list?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, get in contact with us through the plugin page comments and add to the discussion.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>My settings panel does not look like your screenshot?
