We were relying on guess work. This means we couldn&#8217;t scale our marketing efforts.<br \/>\nTo solve this problem we began to sprinkle Coupon codes.<br \/>\nPeople began to use coupon and I would get the source of leads.<br \/>\nBut there was still a big problem.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just to track the source of leads we were giving upfront discounts.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>It was hurting our revenues.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Researched a bit and discovered that you can create URL with UTM parameters.<br \/>\nA set of additional parameters you can append to a URL that could help you identify the source of the lead.<br \/>\nSo we set it up and began to see results in Google analytics.<\/p>\n<p>Cool at least some part of the problem was solved.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But there were still couple of loose ends:<\/strong><br \/>\n* <strong>Only the traffic stats were captured<\/strong><br \/>\n* <strong>We had to log in to the analytics to see the traffic<\/strong><br \/>\n* <strong>We still could not figure the source of lead if Sally saw our video or did she clicked on video to make a purchase.<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>UTM Leads Tracker was born to solve this problem.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If you can append UTM parameters to your links, UTM Lead Tracker would show you the source of the visit once it converts to lead.<br \/>\nSo say you are marketing your products on Facebook and give UTM parameters as utm_source<br \/>\nOnce that lead signs up your contact form or orders from you these parameters will be captured along with contact details.<br \/>\nOur system is compatible with eCommerce platforms such as WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads.<br \/>\nYou can track source of your leads right from WordPress without having to visit google dashboard.<br \/>\nIt keeps you informed about which channels are bringing more leads and gives you idea of your marketing campaigns effectiveness.<\/p>\n<p>**Best part it\u2019s free \ud83d\ude42 **<\/p>\n<p>So use this and track source of your leads hassle free.<\/p>\n<h3>Also Checkout our other free plugins<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Finale Sales CountDown Timer<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/woo-thank-you-page-nextmove-lite\/\" rel=\"ugc\">NextMove WooCommerce Thank You Page<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Visit Us at <a href=\"https:\/\/xlplugins.com\/?utm_source=nextmove-lite&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=lite&amp;utm_term=main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">XLPLUGINS.COM<\/a> to know more about premium products.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Search UTM Leads Tracker in WordPress Repo and Install.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the Plugin.<\/li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it \ud83d\ude42<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='who%20is%20utm%20leads%20tracker%20ideal%20for%3F'>\nWho is UTM Leads Tracker ideal for?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Those who want to track which of their campaigns are converting and which are time &amp; money wasting.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20does%20it%20take%20to%20set%20up%20utm%20leads%20tracker%3F'>\nHow long does it take to set up UTM Leads Tracker?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just Activate and it is done.
