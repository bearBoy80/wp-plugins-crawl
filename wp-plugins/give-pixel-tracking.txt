This passes the currency and donation amount to your Ad Manager as well. <\/li>\n<li>The <code>CompleteRegistration<\/code> event if your form either forces user registration, or if your donor opts to have a user account created. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can learn about this and other events via the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/402791146561655?id=1205376682832142\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook Business Help<\/a> section.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION<\/strong><br \/>\nThis add-on does not implement the Facebook pixel on your website.

To do an automatic install of Give, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.<\/p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;Give Pixel Tracking&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h4>Manual installation<\/h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Updating<\/h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20install%20the%20facebook%20pixel%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\nHow do I install the Facebook Pixel on my website?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are many ways to do that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/search\/facebook+pixel\/\" rel=\"ugc\">a few plugins that can help<\/a>. <\/li>\n<li>Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/m\/pixel-platform-install\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">a detailed guide from Facebook on how to install and test your pixel<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is important to understand that this plugin only works if the Facebook Pixel is already installed on your website.
