The featured image gallery widget makes this process visual, automatically showing the featured images for all of the posts on a given view (archives, taxonomy terms, etc.) in one place. The widget is only displayed on views with multiple posts, and uses the same styling as the core gallery widget.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Take the easy route and install through the WordPress plugin installer OR<\/li>\n<li>Download the .zip file and upload the unzipped folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Add the widget to your sidebar or footer<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='not%20linking%20to%20post'>\nNot Linking to Post\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The images within the gallery will typically link to the post where they&#8217;re featured. This only works when the image is uploaded to the post. Images that are selected from the media library (previously uploaded elsewhere) when being featured are not &#8220;attached&#8221; to the post, and will not link back to the post in this widget.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='gallery%20display%20issues'>\nGallery Display Issues\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin relies on core and theme gallery markup and styling.
