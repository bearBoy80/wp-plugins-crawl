Have you broken anything on your webpage? WP Lock has you covered, use our simple admin bar widget to lock your site when needed.<\/p>\n<p>We let you define a specific timespan to unlock and lock your site again, this can be useful if you want to show your work to a client, co-worker or friend.<\/p>\n<p>After installation, you can use the &#8220;WP Lock&#8221; settings section inside your admin bar to lock or unlock your site. We indicate that your site is either locked or public by using a green or red color which makes it clear to the developer and site admins if &#8220;WP Lock&#8221; is activated at this moment.<\/p>\n<p>If the plugin is enabled, you can only visit your website if you are logged as an administrator. Other people (&#8216;guests&#8217;) will see a white page with just a short but customizable text notice rather than the website itself.<\/p>\n<p>You can choose between 4 plugin states:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Disable permanently<br \/>\nThe plugin is disabled forever &#8211; show the website for everyone (you can also deactivate the plugin as a whole to archive the same behavior)<\/li>\n<li>Enable permanently<br \/>\nThe plugin is enabled forever, for now. Use this setting to hide the website from &#8216;guests&#8217;, a green section of the admin bar will indicate that your site is offline.<\/li>\n<li>Disable for [TIME]<br \/>\nConfigure a manual timeframe in X minutes, hours, days or weeks where your site will be <strong>open<\/strong> for the specific duration. The site will jump back to a <strong>locked<\/strong> state after the defined time.<\/li>\n<li>Enable for<br \/>\nConfigure a manual timeframe in X minutes, hours, days or weeks where your site will be <strong>locked<\/strong> for the specific duration.
