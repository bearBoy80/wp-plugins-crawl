Both WordPress and phpBB are very complex systems that work in quite different ways and I was very tentative about what this plugin was doing, and how it would work.\n\nI must say that the plugin works GREAT, and after spending a bit of time to read the instructions and understand WHAT the plugin is doing it all made sense and I was able to get it to work GREAT.  I was doing a VERY COMPLICATED integration with multiple plugins that all dealt with users and passwords and I had two problems which the developer worked out with me very quickly online.  AXEW3 is really a great developer and cares that people using this plugin are getting the most from it!  Thank you for all your help!\n\nPlease, <strong>READ<\/strong> and <strong>UNDERSTAND<\/strong> the documentation.  If you don't understand it go to the forum axew3 has setup and read and learn.  Integrating WordPress and phpB is not an easy task!\n\nI am redirecting all my users to register and change their password in WordPress.  phpBB does not handle any of the user\/password handling and all customers go to WordPress for that.  I am also using a memberships plugin that handles multiple paid memberships in WordPress including add-ons and upselling, etc which is why I needed to force all the registration tasks to WordPress.  With WP w3all phpBB plugin it all works fine.\n\nThank you for all your time and effort to solve a very complex and important challenge!!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div

I use it now and do also use the iframe feature which works great.\n\nI recently had some issues when switching my site to SSL and I opened a support thread and the support by the author was way better than I expected. I got suggestions for code fix and even help with troubleshooting my phpBB and WP setup. The support felt very personal which was great.\n\n\/Tomas\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">it works<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/woei66\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6947638373b0ff35e9a0c007166ee6cb?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6947638373b0ff35e9a0c007166ee6cb?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/woei66\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">woei66<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 20, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This plugin for wordpress 4.9.6 + phpbb 3.2.2 works.\n\nMy installation steps:\n1. my domain name is <code>www.example.com<\/code>\n2.
