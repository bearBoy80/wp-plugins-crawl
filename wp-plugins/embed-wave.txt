It allows multiple waves to be displayed on the same page- useful if you\u2019re going to have multiple waves in a single post, or individual waves across multiple posts being displayed on the front page of your blog.<\/p>\n<p>Waves are embedded by using shortcodes (e.g. [wave id=&#8221;wave-id&#8221;]). Google is the default provider, to change this you\u2019ll simply need to change the type attribute of the shortcode, e.g. [wave id=&#8221;wave-id&#8221; type=&#8221;google-wave-sandbox&#8221;] for the Google Wave Sandbox. Alternative content (for when javascript is disabled or the wave embed API fails to load) can be added by placing content between the shortcode tags e.g. [wave id=&#8221;wave-id&#8221;]zomgwtf rss bbq[\/wave] &#8211; the alt content is removed after the Wave has been loaded.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, \u201cEmbed Wave\u201d is extensible, in that new providers can be added by other plugins via the WordPress filter system. In fact, the plugin does this itself in order to add Google Wave.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>embed-wave<\/code> directory to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<p>1.3 (2009-11-19)  <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Added support for Widgets.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p> 1.2 (2009-11-17)  <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improved documentation on shortcodes in the readme.txt description section.<\/li>\n<li>Forgot to change version numbers in PHP file \ud83d\ude1b<\/li>\n<li>Removed Google Wave from the static JS, since it gets loaded by Marvulous_Embed_Wave::js()<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p> 1.1 (2009-11-17)  <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Added support for specifying the width of the wave panel.<\/li>\n<li>Added support for alternative content (not using , since that would prevent alt content from being displayed if javascript was enabled but the wave embed api failed to load).<\/li>\n<li>Added support for the google wave sandbox.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p> 1.0 (2009-11-11)  <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Added support for Google Wave<\/li>\n<li>Made Plugin extensible via add_filter(&#8216;Marvulous_Embed_Wave::provider&#8217;)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-wave\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1443778\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-wave\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1443778\" alt=\"Creating a page with multiple waves using shortcodes.\"><\/a><p>Creating a page with multiple waves using shortcodes.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-wave\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1443778\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-wave\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1443778\" alt=\"The resulting page with 2 waves embedded.\"><\/a><p>The resulting page with 2 waves embedded.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-wave\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1443778\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-wave\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1443778\" alt=\"Adding a wave into the sidebar.\"><\/a><p>Adding a wave into the sidebar.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-wave\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1443778\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-wave\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1443778\" alt=\"3 waves on a single page, 1 in two places at once!\"><\/a><p>3 waves on a single page, 1 in two places at once!<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/embed-wave.1.3.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-wave\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1443778","caption":"Creating a page with multiple waves using shortcodes."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-wave\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1443778","caption":"The resulting page with 2 waves embedded."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-wave\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1443778","caption":"Adding a wave into the sidebar."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/embed-wave\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1443778","caption":"3 waves on a single page, 1 in two places at once!"}},"tags":{"embed":"embed","google":"google","wave":"wave"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/embed-wave.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/embed-wave.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/embed-wave.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/embed-wave.1.3.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/embed-wave.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
