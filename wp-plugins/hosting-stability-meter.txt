Like,<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>CPU test<\/li>\n<li>Disk test<\/li>\n<li>Database test<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The plugin stores benchmarks results and displays detailed graph for every benchmark. The graph shows hosting performance peaks and dips.<br \/>\nMany peaks and dips mean low hosting stability. You can use this in hosting support conversations.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin uses this <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/hostingstabilitymeter\/php-benchmarks-library\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">benchmarks library<\/a>.<br \/>\nEach benchmark takes no more that 1 second. You fully control benchmarks calls frequency.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin may inform you about performance lacks by e-mail.<br \/>\nAlso it may send stability benchmark results to <a href=\"https:\/\/HostingStabilityMeter.Com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HostingStabilityMeter.Com<\/a> if you allow. It helps to maintain a rating of hosters.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note: <a href=\"https:\/\/HostingStabilityMeter.Com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HostingStabilityMeter.Com<\/a> will never publish or give somebody neither your benchmark results nor hardware information.<\/em><\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Install the plugin as usual in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Set up speed loss thresholds for each benchmark: CPU, Disk and Database.
