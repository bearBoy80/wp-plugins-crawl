You can review the item and either approve or reject.<br \/>\nIf you approve, the item will be added to WooCommerce and is immediately available in your store. You may change the &#8220;split&#8221; on the revenue from the item. The default is 50-50.<br \/>\nIf you reject, the seller will be notified by email.<br \/>\nYou can also use the plugin to put your existing inventory online. Use the easy form, snap a few pictures, and it will automatically be added to your WooCommerce online store without going through the approval step.<\/p>\n<p>Uninstalling the plugin will remove all associated tables and data.<\/p>\n<p>Pre-requisites:<br \/>\nWooCommerce<\/p>\n<h4>Live Demo<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/charlenesweb.ca\/cws-demos\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>Seller&#8217;s Form to Add Item and the Admin area<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Doc<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/charlenesweb.ca\/cws-documentation\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Documentation<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Image resized on user&#8217;s device before upload<\/li>\n<li>Images deleted from Media Library if item is rejected<\/li>\n<li>Help seller set a price by displaying lowest, highest and average prices for items in your store, by category.<\/li>\n<li>Track payouts to the seller once an item sells.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<p>The easiest way to install CWS Consignment Store is via your WordPress Dashboard. Go to the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; screen, click &#8220;Add New&#8221;, and search for &#8220;CWS Consignment&#8221; in the WordPress Plugin Directory. Then, click &#8220;Install Now&#8221; and wait a moment. Finally, click &#8220;Activate&#8221; and start using the plugin!<\/p>\n<p>Manual installation works just as for other WordPress plugins:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/cws-consignment.latest-stable.zip\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Download<\/a> and extract the ZIP file.<\/li>\n<li>Move the folder &#8220;cws-consignment&#8221; to the &#8220;wp-content\/plugins\/&#8221; directory of your WordPress installation, e.g. via FTP.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin &#8220;CWS Consignment Store&#8221; on the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; screen of your WordPress Dashboard.<\/li>\n<li>Create a page for potential Sellers to submit their items and add the shortcode [additemform]<\/li>\n<li>Review the submitted items in the WordPress admin area.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='what%20size%20are%20the%20images%20uplon%20upload%3F'>\nWhat size are the images uplon upload?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Images are resized to a maximum of 544px height or width.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20add%20a%20sku%20to%20the%20item%3F'>\nHow do I add a SKU to the item?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are logged in to your site, go to the page where you have included the [additemform] shortcode and you will see SKU as the first input field.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20sku%27s%20have%20to%20be%20unique%3F'>\nDo SKU&#8217;s have to be unique?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>SKU&#8217;s do need to be unique. Since this is for a consignment shop it is assumed each item is unique and requires its own sku.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='i%20get%20a%20403%20when%20i%20try%20to%20select%20an%20image%20on%20the%20add%20item%20form.'>\nI get a 403 when I try to select an image on the Add Item form.\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>I have seen this on Microsoft Edge when there is a security plugin such as WordFence activated. You need to allow basedir to be posted. In WordFence, go to All Options and scroll down to Allolisted URLs. Add a new URL that is the page where your form is (\/addanitem\/ for example). Select Param Type POST Body, and enter basedir in the Param Name. Click ADD. Add another rule now for the ajax file by entering URL \/wp-content\/plugins\/cws-consignment\/public\/class-cws-consignment-public.php. And again select Param Type POST Body, and enter basedir in the Param Name. Click ADD. And Save Changes.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.7.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for PHP 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.7.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update version number<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Feature add: added more Store Split options<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Feature add: added 0\/100 as an option for the split (100% to seller)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove debug message<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Spelling error<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Small formatting change<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove admin-ajax references since causing 403 errors<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Validate works with WordPress 5.9<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>File verification at upload and attach<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add more file verification<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2600131\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2600131\" alt=\"Add Item Form\"><\/a><p>Add Item Form<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2600131\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2600131\" alt=\"Review Submitted Items\"><\/a><p>Review Submitted Items<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=2600131\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=2600131\" alt=\"Manage Payouts\"><\/a><p>Manage Payouts<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=2600131\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=2600131\" alt=\"Settings\"><\/a><p>Settings<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-5.jpg?rev=2600131\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-5.jpg?rev=2600131\" alt=\"Documentation\"><\/a><p>Documentation<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.1.7.2.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2600131","caption":"Add Item Form"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2600131","caption":"Review Submitted Items"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=2600131","caption":"Manage Payouts"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=2600131","caption":"Settings"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-5.jpg?rev=2600131","caption":"Documentation"}},"tags":{"consignment-for-woocommerce":"consignment for WooCommerce","consignment-store":"consignment store"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.1.3.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.1.4.zip","1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.1.5.zip","1.5.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.1.5.1.zip","1.5.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.1.5.2.zip","1.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.1.6.zip","1.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.1.7.zip","1.7.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.1.7.1.zip","1.7.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.1.7.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/charlenesweb.ca\/donate\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consignment-store-for-woocommerce\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2600131","high":false}}
