No longer being developed &#8211; please switch to Print Flyers Lite, it&#8217;s very similar.<br \/>\nWooCommerce ProductPrint makes it easy for potential customers to print off their own copy of product literature, straight from the product page via a button. You can configure the button to appear in one of a selection of positions on the single product page. A variety of options are available via the WordPress dashboard settings to control the appearance of the printed page. For example, you can change the size and position of the featured image, and you can choose from a selection of fonts. You can choose to show SKU or not; or stock status or not, etc. Requires WooCommerce 3 or above.<\/p>\n<h4>Automatic installation<\/h4>\n<p>To do an automatic install of ProductPrint, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the search field type \u201cProductPrint\u201d and click Search Plugins.
