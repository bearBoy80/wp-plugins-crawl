As an added bonus, the developer of the plugin replies to sales\/support emails very quickly, so I know if I ever run into any problems, I won't be left in the cold.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-pusher-slack-notifications.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"bitbucket":"Bitbucket","git":"git","github":"Github","wp-pusher":"WP Pusher"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
