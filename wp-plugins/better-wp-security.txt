Can&#8217;t I use a slightly older version?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>One of the best security practices for a WordPress site owner is keeping software up to date.

Nothing replaces diligence and good practice. This plugin makes it a little easier for you to apply both.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20only%20for%20new%20wordpress%20installs%20or%20can%20i%20use%20it%20on%20existing%20sites%2C%20too%3F'>\nIs this plugin only for new WordPress installs or can I use it on existing sites, too?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>While Solid Security can be installed on either a new or existing site, we strongly recommend making a <a href=\"https:\/\/go.solidwp.com\/security-basic-solid-backups\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">complete backup<\/a> of your existing site before applying any features included in this plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20work%20on%20all%20servers%20and%20hosts%3F'>\nWill this plugin work on all servers and hosts?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Solid Security requires Apache or LiteSpeed and mod_rewrite or NGINX to work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20changes%20does%20this%20plugin%20make%20that%20can%20break%20my%20site%3F'>\nWhat changes does this plugin make that can break my site?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Solid Security makes significant changes to your database and other site files which can be problematic for existing WordPress sites. Again, we strongly recommended making a complete backup of your site before using this plugin. While problems are rare, most support requests involve the failure to make a proper backup before installation.

Use ITSEC_USE_CRON instead.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Preserve notification settings when the responsible module is deactivated.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Process 404 lockouts on the &#8216;wp&#8217; hook to prevent a headers have already been sent warning message.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Ensure Hide Backend emails are properly sent when activating Hide Backend before saving the Notification Center for the first time.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Prevent warning from being issued on new installs by allowing previous settings to be preserved if they exist.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Better handle WP_Error objects in mail errors that occurred before updating to first patch release.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: A non static method was being called statically.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fix occasional duplicate backups and file scans.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed issue where scheduled events could repeat on sites that do not properly support WordPress&#8217;s cron system.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Reactivating Away Mode now replaces the active file if you had previously removed it.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Ensure lockouts take effect immediately, even on systems where changes to server configuration files do not take effect immediately.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.7.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New Feature: Introduces the Notification Center, a centralized place to manage and customize email notifications sent by iThemes Security.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Updated queries and prepare statements to account for changes to the esc_sql() function in WordPress 4.8.3.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Corrected some Javascript and CSS links not generating correctly on Windows servers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.6.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed SQL query bug that resulted in the &#8220;Minutes to Remember Bad Login (check period)&#8221; setting being ignored.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed bug that prevents wp-admin\/install.php blocking from working properly on nginx servers.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Don&#8217;t attempt to do an SSL redirect when WP CLI is running.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.6.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New Feature: Added a new setting in WordPress Tweaks: &#8220;Login with Email Address or Username&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Host email images from the plugin instead of relying on iThemes servers to help email clients marking messages as spam or blocking images.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Error when searching for modules preventing modules from appearing.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Use the wp_options table when acquiring locks in Multisite.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Prevent duplicate daily digest emails on sites with high load.<\/li>\n<li>Misc: Added Magic Links, a new Pro-only feature, to be activated by Security Check.<\/li>\n<li>Misc: Rearranged modules to be listed alphabetically.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.5.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed logical error that prevented backups from executing.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed issue that could cause database locks to flood the database.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.5.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Simplified the SSL module to offer a simple Enable\/Disable setting and simplified explanations. The legacy settings are available by selecting Advanced.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added the itsec-get-ip filter to allow code to supply the remote IP directly.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Enabling SSL support will only log you out if you are not already on an https connection.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Improve password requirements compatibility with plugins and systems that integrate with WordPress Users.<\/li>\n<li>Removed Old Feature: Removed the &#8220;Replace jQuery With a Safe Version&#8221; feature as its use (protecting against a specific jQuery bug: https:\/\/bugs.jquery.com\/ticket\/9521) is many years old and is no longer a concern.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Bumped version number of some scripts to ensure that they refresh properly.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed way to work around Hide Backend on some hosts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.4.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Replaced file locking with database locking. This method of locking is compatible with all systems as it does not require the ability to write files. It also allows for locking to work on sites that have multiple front-end servers with a shared database. Since file locking is no longer used, the Global Settings &gt; Disable File Locking setting was removed.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Add &#8220;Copy to Clipboard&#8221; functionality for server and wp-config rules.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Prevent 404s when following links in email notifications on a site with Hide Backend enabled.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Ensure uninstall process is not run when another version of iThemes Security is still active.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed method of working around Hide Backend.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Warnings are no longer generated when saving a user profile with a role of &#8220;No role for this site&#8221; selected.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.3.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Important: The way that Hide Backend functions changes in this release. Previously, if your Hide Backend Login Slug was wplogin, going to example.com\/wplogin would result in the URL remaining example.com\/wplogin. The new implementation of this feature results in a redirect to a URL that looks as follows: example.com\/wp-login.php?itsec-hb-token=wplogin. While this may not be desireable for some users, this change was necessary to fix longstanding compatibility issues with other plugins. Once you access the login page using the Login Slug page, a cookie is set with an expiration time of one hour. As long as the cookie remains, you can access example.com\/wp-login.php without having to access the Hide Backend Login Slug first. If you wish to confirm that Hide Backend is working properly on your site, opening up a private browsing window is a quick way to test without having to log out and clear cookies.<\/li>\n<li>New Feature: Added support for iThemes Sync to run the Security Check feature from inside the Sync service.<\/li>\n<li>New Feature: Added support for the ITSEC_DISABLE_MODULES define.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Removed warning: &#8220;Non-static method ITSEC_Setup::uninstall() should not be called statically&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed the ability to manually enter a page number to navigate to on the Security &gt; Logs page.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed source of warning that could appear when creating a backup while running a PHP version less than 5.4.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed source of notice that could appear when reseting a user&#8217;s password when the Strong Passwords Enforcement feature is enabled.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed bugs that prevented reporting of specific error messages related to updating the wp-config.php file.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed an infinite loop that could occur when expiring a cookie and Hide Backend is enabled.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed compatibility issue with the Jetpack plugin when Hide Backend is enabled which could prevent Jetpack from redirecting users to the wordpress.com login page.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed issue where access to wp-admin\/admin-post.php when Hide Backend is enabled.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed issue that could prevent &#8220;Register&#8221; and &#8220;Lost your password?&#8221; links from working properly on the login page when Hide Backend is enabled.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fix fatal error when updating a profile.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fix strong passwords not being recognized as strong on the profile page.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fix fatal error when registering a new user without specifying a role ( iThemes Exchange ).<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Compatability with JetPack SSO and Password Requirements.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Ensure viewport meta is defined when loading the password requirements update password form.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Hide Backend is now compatible with Jetpack Single Sign On.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Hide Backend now hides registration pages on multisite sites.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed password-protected posts not properly handling the password when Hide Backend is enabled.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Removed AhrefsBot from the HackRepair blacklist as they are legitimate bot.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Improved efficiency of Hide Backend code, increasing site performance when the feature is enabled.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Enforce strong passwords during log-in. Can be disabled via the ITSEC_DISABLE_PASSWORD_REQUIREMENTS constant.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Use canonical roles library to determine if a new user or an updated role requires a strong password.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Introduce password requirements module to centralize handling of password updates.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: The Hide Backend hidden login URL is no longer leaked by password-protected content.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Allow for searching through modules and settings.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Link to other module settings pages without forcing the page to refresh.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Fire an action, &#8220;itsec_change_admin_user_id&#8221;, when the admin user id changes.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Changed default Hide Backend Register Slug from wp-register.php to wp-signup.php since WordPress switched from using wp-register.php to wp-signup.php for registrations. This will not affect existing sites.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Hide Backend functions purely in PHP code now rather than relying half on PHP code and half on .htaccess and nginx.conf modifications. This allows Hide Backend to function on web servers and server configurations that it was previously not compatible with.<\/li>\n<li>Misc: Updated or added phpDoc to many functions.<\/li>\n<li>Misc: Updated Disable File Locking description.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug Fix: When a requesting IP address cannot be found, default to 127.0.0.1. This fixes issues with some alternate cron setups.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Having more than one iThemes Security modification in a .htaccess, nginx.conf, or wp-config.php file will no longer result in having all the file content between each section removed when updating the file.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Modifications to the wp-config.php file added by W3 Total Cache now have their Windows-style newlines preserved when iThemes Security updates the file.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Improved plugin performance by reducing the number of queries made on each page.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Reduced memory and CPU usage due to various code improvements.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: A database backup will no longer be created when first activating the plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Added compatibility for MySQL strict mode in database creation syntax.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Removed warning about a &#8220;non well formed numeric value encountered&#8221; in PHP 7.1.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Modifications to wp-config.php, .htaccess, and nginx.conf files are now properly re-added upon reactivation.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed full settings for Hide Backend being displayed after disabling the feature and saving the settings.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Enabling or disabling the Hide Backend feature will update the &#8220;Log Out&#8221; link so that it works as expected without having to load a new page.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Enabling or disabling the Hide Backend feature now properly updates the .htaccess\/nginx.conf file on enable and disable rather than at some future point.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed issue that could cause improper database table creation on multisite sites.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed a bug that could prevent settings from saving properly if the site was migrated to a new server or a new home path on the server.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed bug that prevented Away Mode from activating on some sites.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Added logging for failed two-factor, OAuth, and REST API authentications.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added logging details about the source of login failures and the type of authentication that failed.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Due to improvements in tracking authentication failures, brute force attempts using alternate authentication methods are more reliably found and blocked.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: The server&#8217;s IP is treated as whitelisted and will not be considered for lockouts or bans.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Reduced memory usage when creating a backup.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Changed log entry description of &#8220;IP Flagged as bad by iThemes IPCheck&#8221; to &#8220;IP Flagged by Network Brute Force Protection&#8221;. This should help clarify the meaning of the log entry.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Improved efficiency of the Network Brute Force Protection feature.<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Fixed bug that prevented Network Brute Force Protection from working properly on some sites.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug Fix: Removed &#8220;comodo&#8221; from the list of user agents blocked by the HackRepair.com blacklist. This ensures that Comodo&#8217;s AutoSSL feature of cPanel\/WHM is able to function.<\/li>\n<li>Updated Feature: Updated the &#8220;REST API&#8221; feature in the WordPress Tweaks section. The feature now has proper support for protecting privacy on your site without preventing the REST API from functioning.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Updated Security Check to enforce setting the &#8220;REST API&#8221; setting to &#8220;Restricted Access&#8221;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.9.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New Feature: Added a &#8220;REST API&#8221; feature in the WordPress Tweaks section.
