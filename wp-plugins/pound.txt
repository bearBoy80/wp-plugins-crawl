You can run the plugin on the actual site where you are developing if you don&#8217;t have<br \/>\na test site. There is virtually no configuration necessary to start writing tests. The overall<br \/>\nintention of this plugin is to make unit testing more accessible to WordPress plugin developers.<\/p>\n<p>PHPUnit is a very powerful tool and is great for testing PHP code including WordPress plugins.<br \/>\nIn fact, if you get into using WP-CLI you will notice that there is built-in support for using<br \/>\nPHPUnit to test your code. Pound is not intended to replace the need for PHPUnit. It is intended<br \/>\nto provide an easy way to get started with unit testing WordPress plugins. It&#8217;s a great option<br \/>\nfor small to medium sized plugins.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How is Pound different from PHPUnit?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>On one hand, Pound and PHPUnit are both tools to help you run automated tests for your code.<br \/>\nPound is built as a WordPress plugin, and therefore really only intended to be used for WordPress<br \/>\ndevelopment. PHPUnit can be used to test any codebase. The main benefits of Pound over PHPUnit<br \/>\nare ease of use. Pound has one boolean check at the end of each tests. PHPUnit has a very large<br \/>\nnumber of assertions. Pound requires virtually no configuration to start using. PHPUnit requires<br \/>\nXML configuration files to set up your testing environment. Pound runs right in your web browser<br \/>\nwith clean, colorful output. PHPUnit is a command line tool.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update minimum PHP requirement to PHP 5.4<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial relase of Pound<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pound\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1738479\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pound\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1738479\" alt=\"Shortcode to run tests\"><\/a><p>Shortcode to run tests<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pound\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1738479\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pound\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1738479\" alt=\"Example output with a failing test\"><\/a><p>Example output with a failing test<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Awesome start!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/johndeebdd\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ce7638c7eeed53d5a7a87e9aa117f201?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ce7638c7eeed53d5a7a87e9aa117f201?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/johndeebdd\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">johndeebdd<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 26, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">We need to start writing testable code in WordPress plugins! There are very few academic projects in this area, and Lee Blue has put forward a really cool plugin here. This plugin takes a unique approach in that it is extremely simple and limited in what it can do. It's a great start for programmers looking to get into testing their plugins. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pound.1.0.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pound\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1738479","caption":"Shortcode to run tests"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pound\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1738479","caption":"Example output with a failing test"}},"tags":{"development":"development","plugins":"plugins","testing":"testing","unit-testing":"unit testing"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pound.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pound.1.0.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pound.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pound\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1371035","high":false}}
