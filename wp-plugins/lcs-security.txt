Simply install, activate, and rest assured that your site is now protected against most common attacks.<\/p>\n<p>We attempted to create the &#8220;Goldilocks&#8221; of WordPress security by finding a happy medium between the really complicated plugins that seem to slow down your site and often break functionality because they are too restrictive, and the piece-meal ones that only address one or two vulnerabilities at a time.<\/p>\n<p>The following areas of security weakness are addressed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>XML RPC Protection &#8211; stops unauthorized content injection.<\/li>\n<li>Author Scanning Prevention &#8211; prevents revealing of user login names.<\/li>\n<li>Malicious Script Blocking &#8211; stops execution of scripts in specific vulnerable directories.<\/li>\n<li>Comment Spam Prevention &#8211; adds a CAPTCHA to the comment form.<\/li>\n<li>User Login Protection &#8211; includes automatic timed failed login attempt lockouts and CAPTCHA for login page.<\/li>\n<li>Automatic IP Ban &#8211; bans IP&#8217;s from the entire site based on number of failed login attempts.<\/li>\n<li>IP Blacklist &#8211; allows adding known bad IP&#8217;s and bans them from the entire site.<\/li>\n<li>IP Whitelist &#8211; allows adding known good IP&#8217;s.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This plugin also provides a log of all login attempts including geographical IP data.<\/p>\n<p>Temporarily locked IP&#8217;s can be unlocked by the administrator.<\/p>\n<p>Permanently banned IP&#8217;s can be un-banned by the administrator.<\/p>\n<p>CAUTION:  Do not use this plugin with other security plugins to avoid conflicts and other site issues.

I knew immediately after installing this plugin that it was working by watching the log fill up quickly.  I was having thousands of fake login attempts every hour.  This software went to work right away and it's all automatic.  It first locks out the bad IP's a couple of times after a few failed attempts, then blocks the IP's permanently after a few more.  It's actually fun to watch this thing fighting the hackers by watching the log.  Take that hackers!\n\nIt's also super simple to use.  Very clear user interface, easy to understand options, and the default settings seem just fine.  I looked at some other security plugins and they were truly intimidating and most of them tried to upsell to the \"Pro\" versions for money.  This one appears to be completely free and full featured and doesn't have any fancy versions you have to pay for.  You can easily tell this was created by good developers.\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">This works very well!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jonathan227400\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b76e68de0a2d95361d197f0db8207b0b?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b76e68de0a2d95361d197f0db8207b0b?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jonathan227400\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">jonathan227400<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 14, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I used to have iThemes security installed, but it was giving me a lot of problems on my highly customized e-commerce site.  It was way too stringent and restrictive and kept breaking functionality.  I kept turning features off until I had virtually no protection.  That's when I started getting bombarded by hacker attacks.  I've had fake posts injected into my blog.  I've had bogus users created.  I've had tens of thousands of login attempts constantly filling up my logs.\n\nI installed this based on a recommendation.  I watched the logs for a few days.  The first day I had 8740 hacker login attempts.  On the second day it was down to 5103.  Third day - 2030.  Fourth day - 607.  By the fifth day, the bogus login attempts were down to 61.  Amazing!!! This plugin automatically blocked 946 IP's over five days and the hack attempts virtually stopped and have been below 50\/day for the past few days.  And, best of all, it didn't break any of my site functionality and I didn't notice any performance degradation.\n\nI also like the ability to view the log which lists the country and city of the hack attempts, and also to view all the IP's that are blocked, along with their geographic location as well.  My only suggestion is to add a feature where you can block an entire country - maybe in the next version?  Otherwise - great job on this plugin guys!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.2.5.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/lcs-security\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1506519","caption":"Options page."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/lcs-security\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1506519","caption":"Options - continued."}},"tags":{"attack":"attack","hacker":"hacker","protection":"protection","security":"security","virus":"virus"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.1.3.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.1.4.zip","1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.1.5.zip","1.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.1.6.zip","1.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.1.7.zip","1.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.1.8.zip","1.9":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.1.9.zip","2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.2.0.zip","2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.2.1.zip","2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.2.2.zip","2.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.2.3.zip","2.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.2.4.zip","2.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.2.5.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lcs-security.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
