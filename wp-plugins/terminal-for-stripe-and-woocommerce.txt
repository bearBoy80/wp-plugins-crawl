How to fix this?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is likely because either your order or your cart contains ineligible order data.  Even if your order data is valid, if your cart contains items which do not support this payment method, it will still fail and you will have to empty your cart first.  That is a WC flaw, it isn&#8217;t caused by our plugin.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20get%20a%20critical%20error%20when%20creating%20orders%20on%20the%20mobile%20app%3F'>\nWhy do I get a critical error when creating orders on the mobile app?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have WC Pay (WooCommerce Payments) installed, disable it.  If not, read the next sentence.  The API is built on the V3 legacy API which uses the WC_API_Orders function.  Functions which attempt to hook into the order methods will malfunction.  The add_order_meta() function is one which we&#8217;ve seen does not match the same number of arguments as exists within the v3 legacy API.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20costs%20involved%3F'>\nAre there any costs involved?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a free plugin, so there are no license fees but you do have to pay your transaction fees as you would with any gateway plugin.

This version is intended only to provide a retail point-of-sale experience in which an authorized representative is logged in to accept credit cards.  This is both for tracking who has accepted charges as well as to prevent the public from seeing the terminal icon while remotely viewing the site.  Because of this, purchases which require customer information (such as recurring billing info or email addresses) cannot be performed as the current session contains the administrator&#8217;s information.  If you need to work around that, visit our website and purchase &#8220;Pro Services&#8221;.  If you are already a PRO Services user, verify that your user is assigned to a location.

As of date of this writing (January 2020), Stripe Terminal is only supported in North America (US and Canada).  Although Stripe does allow transactions overseas for cards typically used in European countries like Maestro, PIN transactions for those unsupported regions are not available.  Additionally, the readers themselves are not available for purchase outside the US.  As soon as Stripe announces support overseas, anyone who installs either of our plugins will receive notification.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20buy%20a%20reader%3F'>\nWhere can I buy a reader?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our support team will only support the readers purchased directly from Stripe.com or <a href=\"https:\/\/store.arcanestrategies.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/store.arcanestrategies.com\/<\/a>.  These readers will not come equipped with the Stripe Terminal software pre-installed unless it&#8217;s purchased from Stripe.com which means you won&#8217;t be able to use the device with Stripe out-of-the-box, unless you buy from Stripe or lease from us.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20doesn%27t%20the%20cancel%20button%20work%3F'>\nWhy doesn&#8217;t the cancel button work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>To cancel an order, hit the &#8220;esc&#8221; key on your keyboard or wait for the timeout to expire.  The Verifone P400&#8217;s action buttons (red, yellow, green) are intended to support settings, they do not cancel or edit payments.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='are%20pin%20transactions%20supported%3F'>\nAre PIN transactions supported?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately Stripe Terminal does not support PIN transactions but they do support debit via signature.

I registered it without a problem!\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whe you register your device, Stripe Terminal will assign your WiFi enabled device to a domain on your private network.  This makes it reachable by the API.  Some Domain Name Servers do not play nicely with that setup, so they may block that traffic.  We suggest that you try switching your network&#8217;s DNS provider to CloudFlare (1.1.1.1) or Google (8.8.8.8).  Although Stripe states that Google should work, we&#8217;ve had customers indicate that it does not, so try both.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20isn%27t%20the%20customer%27s%20information%20shown%20on%20the%20invoice%20and%20email%20receipt%3F'>\nWhy isn&#8217;t the customer&#8217;s information shown on the invoice and email receipt?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please review the documentation above.  Customer account information is not supported in this version, you must purchase PRO Services.  Out-of-the-box, Stripe Terminal does not gather PII data and WooCommerce will bill to the account which is logged in (the admin performing the checkout).  Our PRO Services add-on allows for customer account support to perform purchases for things like subscriptions.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='the%20mobile%20app%20is%20applying%20tax%20on%20tips.%20%20how%20can%20i%20fix%20this%3F'>\nThe mobile app is applying tax on tips.  How can I fix this?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a known issue within the WooCommerce legacy API, it is not an issue within our plugin.  Our mobile app leverages the legacy WooCommerce API (through our API handler) which passes the correct tax settings in order to make a fee_line non-taxable for &#8220;Tips\/Fees&#8221;.  However, this activity is not supported by the legacy API, so this will remain the case until the plugin is updated for the latest API, which will be either in v3 or v4 of the plugin.  Until then unfortunately the best solution would be to either manually edit each order in your WC backend or counteract your tax by deducting it from the tip input.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>2.2.4 &#8211; 2023-04-21<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP8.0 support for public magic methods<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.2.3 &#8211; 2022-09-13<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for WCPOS by Kilbot<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.2.2 &#8211; 2022-03-30<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.2.1 &#8211; 2022-03-09<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved tax logic and address data storage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.2.0 &#8211; 2022-01-05<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for tips and taxes on mobile application as well as location management debugging, store ID and line item data for payment intents and more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.4 &#8211; 2021-12-01<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolution of Stripe Gateway 5.8 regression error which hid the settings fields.

Keeping my fingers crossed that this continues to work properly.\n\nMy recommendation is DO NOT try to use this with the BB POS chipper. Instead, get the BB Wise POS device. The chipper is cute and cheaper, but you have to use their app for it to work, and the app sucks.\n\nAfter switching to the Wise POS device, I still had some issues in getting it set up. Not sure how I got it to work, but I did. I've run some transactions in live mode, and they went through.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Plugin rated highly only be the developer.....<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/kwayk42\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ebdf0b6ee87fb2cdc25f4fc513f0cd33?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ebdf0b6ee87fb2cdc25f4fc513f0cd33?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/kwayk42\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">kwayk42<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 20, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">We downloaded this plugin to connect our Stripe p400 Terminal to WooCommerce (Or so we thought).
