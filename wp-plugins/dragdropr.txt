While it doesn't (yet) \"integrate\" with WordPress in the way you're used to from other popular page builders, I found it a lot easier and faster to use for building out your page content, especially as a new user.\n\nThat's pretty funny since DragDropr is more of a universal page builder that isn't tied excplicitly to WordPress or any other CMS.\n\nDragDropr's approach is different in the sense that you build your layouts via your DragDropr dashboard builder, DragDropr converts your layout and content into HTML, and you paste that HTML into your WordPress WYSIWIG editor in text mode, and voila.\n\nPersonally, I like coding HTML and CSS stuff from scratch, so I tend to stay from page builders. But this tool comes in quite handy when I want to save some time. :-)\n\nGood job and looking forward to when DragDropr can fully tackle dynamic content in WordPress!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/dragdropr.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dragdropr\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1833549","caption":""},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dragdropr\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1833550","caption":""},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dragdropr\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=1833551","caption":""},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dragdropr\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=1833552","caption":""},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dragdropr\/assets\/screenshot-5.jpg?rev=1833553","caption":""}},"tags":{"drag-and-drop":"drag-and-drop","editor":"editor","elementor":"elementor","landing-page":"landing page","page-builder":"page builder"},"versions":{"1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/dragdropr.1.0.3.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/dragdropr.1.0.4.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dragdropr\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=1833543","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dragdropr\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=1833545"}}
