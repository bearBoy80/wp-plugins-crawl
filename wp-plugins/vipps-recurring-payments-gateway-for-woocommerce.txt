This fixes payment captures.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.17.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: Support for WooCommerce High Performance Order Storage (HPOS)<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Period campaigns now show correctly in the app when there&#8217;s both a free trial and a sign-up fee.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Changed the logic for how we determine whether to show our gateway, because certain plugins add their own subscription types. Now we only disable our gateway if Vipps Checkout is being shown as well.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: We no longer care about an order&#8217;s status when it comes to displaying the &#8220;Capture&#8221; button. If there are funds to capture, we show it.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Better error logging for when we try to capture a charge that can no longer be captured. Rewrote the capture payment handler.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Changing gateway was no longer possible in one of the later Woo Subscription versions, due to the use of <code>wp_safe_redirect<\/code>. We now whitelist Vipps&#8217; domains.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.16.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Refunds could not be processed properly because of a mistake when calling the <code>woocommerce_order_after_calculate_totals<\/code> action. We assume the object is always a subscription, when it is not.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.16.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Properly stop checking for a gateway change when a gateway change succeeded.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.16.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Listen for total recalculation instead of a change in orders items when making sure we update the subscription price in Vipps whenever a Vipps subscription&#8217;s price changes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.16.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Updating a subscription. Campaign period was not being serialized properly when calling <code>-&gt;set_period(...)<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.16.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Added a missing file that was not uploaded due to a mistake when committing files to SVN.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.16.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: a <code>wc_vipps_recurring_after_payment_complete<\/code> action<\/li>\n<li>Added: Implementation of period campaigns.

This should fix the order status sometimes being wrong when the user lands on this page.<\/li>\n<li>Refactored: We no longer pass product descriptions to Vipps unless you choose to do so.<\/li>\n<li>Refactored: We now use Vipps&#8217; new campaign system.<\/li>\n<li>Refactored: We no longer need to store the agreement&#8217;s confirmation url ourselves. Idempotency now works as expected.<\/li>\n<li>Changed: We now use the <code>woocommerce_subscription_cancelled_vipps_recurring<\/code> hook instead of <code>woocommerce_subscription_status_cancelled<\/code> to cancel a subscription.<\/li>\n<li>Added: A merchant serial number setting to help Vipps to identify who the merchant is.<\/li>\n<li>Added: New filters, <code>wc_vipps_recurring_create_agreement_data<\/code>, <code>wc_vipps_recurring_update_agreement_data<\/code>, <code>wc_vipps_recurring_cancel_agreement_data<\/code>, <code>wc_vipps_recurring_create_charge_data<\/code>, <code>wc_vipps_recurring_process_payment_agreement<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Fixed: A rare problem that could occur where subscriptions would not be set to &#8220;Active&#8221; when an order&#8217;s status transitions to processing or completed.<\/li>\n<li>Changed: Made the <code>api<\/code> attribute public in <code>WC_Gateway_Vipps_Recurring<\/code> as it may sometimes be beneficial to call the API directly from third party plugins and hand it off to Vipps Recurring later, especially in the charity sector.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.14.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Coupons and &#8220;expire date&#8221; on a product in WooCommerce Subscriptions now play well together.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.14.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Fixed a conflict that prevented Vipps from working in Klarna if Vipps Recurring and Vipps Checkout were installed at the same time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.14.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: You can now swap gateway to Vipps Recurring Payments from a subscription again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.14.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: You can now pay for failed renewal orders. It will cancel the old agreement and substitute it with a new one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.14.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: You will now get an error message when trying to refund an order that is older than 365 days via Vipps.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Do not show this gateway if <code>WCS_ATT_Cart::get_subscription_scheme<\/code> returns null.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: We no longer show that the price is 0,- during a campaign for a synchronised product when Prorate First Renewal is set to &#8220;Never (charge the full recurring amount at sign-up)&#8221;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.14.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Changing payment gateway to Vipps now works again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.14.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Renamed our Vipps access token transient to prevent conflicts with Vipps Checkout when two different sets of merchant tokens are used.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.14.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: Support for <a href=\"https:\/\/woocommerce.com\/products\/all-products-for-woocommerce-subscriptions\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">All Products for WooCommerce Subscriptions<\/a>.

If you renew early, and you&#8217;re already using Vipps it will now skip the app entirely and create a new charge.<br \/>\nIf you renew early, and you&#8217;re not already using Vipps you will be sent to the app and a gateway switch will be performed after successful checkout.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: A small error notice when swapping gateways in the admin area no longer appears.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.13.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Subscriptions now get cancelled if a charge fails and the status of the subscription is <code>pending-cancel<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: If you provide no custom description for a product when the description source is set to <code>custom<\/code> we now default back to the product name. This prevents an error during checkout when no description is provided.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.13.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Pass arguments to <code>wc_vipps_recurring_transaction_id_for_order<\/code> in the correct order.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.13.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: <code>wc_vipps_recurring_merchant_agreement_url<\/code> filter.<\/li>\n<li>Added: <code>wc_vipps_recurring_merchant_redirect_url<\/code> filter.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: No longer use deprecated function <code>WC_Subscriptions_Order::order_contains_subscription<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Make sure we don&#8217;t register the Vipps Recurring gateway twice.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: KCO compatibility <code>headers already output<\/code> notice no longer shows on every page when debug mode is enabled.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Set payment method to Vipps Recurring on the subscription after paying with the Vipps Recurring EPM in KCO. This is likely caused by a WooCommerce bug.<\/li>\n<li>Refactor: <code>capture_payment<\/code> should no longer create a charge if a RESERVED charge does not exist.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Now sets the correct order status for RESERVED payments when paying with Vipps through KCO.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.12.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Product names no longer use the default context, meaning it will no longer get overridden by themes or plugins and show HTML in the Vipps app or app-switch screen.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.12.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Initial charge description no longer contains &#8221; + &#8221; when no extra products are purchased.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Filling in 0 in the trial field tricking us into adding a campaign to the product, also resulting in an empty <code>initialCharge.description<\/code> and being unable to check out.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.12.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Fixed an issue where <code>initialCharge.description<\/code> was empty.

Sorting by meta value does not work in WooCommerce&#8217;s wc_get_orders.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Order by random now works as expected in our periodic status check for charges.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.8.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: The 1.8.2 migration will no longer throw a fatal error for some installations if a subscription does not exist on an order.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.8.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Fixed an issue where an invalid &#8220;my account&#8221; page link would cause checkout to not work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.8.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Added <code>_vipps_recurring_latest_failed_charge_reason<\/code> and <code>_vipps_recurring_latest_failed_charge_description<\/code> to subscriptions.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Migrate the aforementioned data.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Update tested up to, now 5.8.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.8.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Added an exit condition after attempting to redirect to the Cancelled Vipps Purchase page. This should in theory make this redirect work every single time.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: No longer clean up necessary data like charge id or whether the charge is pending on renewals.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Force re-checking of older charges that are affected by the aforementioned fix.<\/li>\n<li>Change: We now check 8 charges at the same time instead of 5.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.8.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Cancelled agreements can not be updated, thus we can not say that they have been cancelled in the description. Ensure we run the &#8220;maybe_update_subscription_details_in_app&#8221; code before we cancel an agreement, and only if the agreement is still &#8220;ACTIVE&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Ensure we only ever cancel an agreement once.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: It&#8217;s no longer possible to end up with more than one Vipps agreement by changing gateway twice or more on accident (this bug was introduced in 1.7.0).<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: We now cancel DUE charges in Vipps when you change an order&#8217;s status to &#8216;Cancelled&#8217; or &#8216;Failed&#8217;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.7.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Add missing Norwegian translation for &#8220;No failed charges found.&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Failed charges now appear properly in the &#8220;Failed charges&#8221; list.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed an edge case when changing payment method to Vipps as a customer, when already using Vipps.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Support upgrading to a different product variation. Price is now passed along properly and a campaign is applied in order to not confuse the customer.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Update agreement in app when downgrading or not prorating a subscription.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Do not allow multiple subscriptions in a single Vipps payment when other gateways that support it are enabled.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: No longer show the &#8220;capture&#8221; button on an order where the charge has failed previously.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Delete meta values from renewal and resubscribe orders to make sure we get fresh charges.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: WooCommerce&#8217;s automatic retry system should now work as expected on renewal orders. We now override the behaviour of <code>wcs_is_scheduled_payment_attempt<\/code> in our <code>check_charge_status<\/code> function.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: The subscription description is now prefixed in the Vipps app with &#8220;[Pending cancellation]&#8221;, &#8220;[Cancelled]&#8221; and &#8220;[On hold]&#8221; depending on the subscription&#8217;s status.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added a setting per product for what source should be used for an agreement&#8217;s description. You can now choose between product title, product short description, or custom text.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Display sign up fees in a better way in the Vipps app. Use a campaign with a price of 0,- until the next payment date.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Update item name and description in app for delayed in app updates.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added a link to explain the various possible failure reasons.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Ability to change gateway from the admin dashboard, this means setting another Vipps agreement ID manually. This should also allow using the REST API to create a subscription.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Bring style on notices and in product tabs up to par with the Vipps e-com plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.6.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Swapping payment gateway to Vipps now works again after the recent WooCommerce and WooCommerce Subscription updates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.6.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: &#8216;free&#8217; agreements where the agreement status is &#8216;STOPPED&#8217; should not be completed.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Do not attempt to fetch charge for synchronised renewals at initial order.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Add &#8216;completed&#8217; to &#8216;woocommerce_valid_order_statuses_for_payment_complete&#8217; conditionally instead of rolling our own logic.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Remove visibility modifier from <code>const<\/code> to fix support for PHP 7.0.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.6.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: There&#8217;s now an overview of failed charges and their failure reason on the Settings -&gt; Vipps Recurring Payments page.<\/li>\n<li>Refactor: Use the Helper class for most of our frequently used meta keys.<\/li>\n<li>Refactor: Renamed the class filenames, class names remain untouched.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Redirect to last known agreement confirmation URL if the agreement is pending. This prevents being stuck in checkout.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: No longer attempt to charge a non existent agreement when a renewal is attempted on a subscription that does not have a Vipps agreement.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Multibyte characters like &#8216;\u00e6\u00f8\u00e5&#8217; in product titles work, these characters caused an internal server error when json encoding.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Cancelled or expired &#8220;zero amount&#8221; payments getting stuck in the checking queue<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: A rare edge case where an order was never captured for a long time and the order would not disappear from the status checker tool.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: A rare edge case where a new pending renewal order would not fetch the Charge ID properly when hitting the capture payment button.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed an issue where 100% off coupons did not automatically complete the initial purchase<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: The status checker tool now shows the latest status from the API as a column value<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: We now validate Vipps API details when you save your settings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Fixed a bug where you were able to checkout the same order more than once while a Vipps agreement is not expired. This fixes problems with multiple charges occurring.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: We&#8217;re no longer trying to cancel an agreement in Vipps when the status is anything other than <code>ACTIVE<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: No longer throw an error and retry with &#8220;latest charge&#8221; when we hit a rate limit when checking a single charge.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: No longer mark an order as &#8220;Failed&#8221; if a charge&#8217;s status is &#8220;FAILED&#8221; unless an agreement is also &#8220;EXPIRED&#8221; or &#8220;STOPPED&#8221; (a user can be prompted to swap card or top-up bank account in-app).<\/li>\n<li>Fix: No longer attempt to cancel an already cancelled charge.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: We should no longer hit the Vipps API rate-limit as a result of a renewal order.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Properly set the <code>_charge_id<\/code> meta key when capturing a payment.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Changing of gateways to Vipps Recurring Payments would sometimes cancel the new agreement instead of the old one due to a race condition.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Multiples of the same product in the same subscription will now be charged correctly based on the total order price.<\/li>\n<li>Tweak: Updated the <code>WC_VIPPS_RECURRING_RETRY_DAYS<\/code> constant to 4 days by default.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Bolstered compatibility with WC &lt; 3.0. Created a bunch of helper functions and doubled down on our backwards compatibility with fetching IDs and fetching plus updating meta.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: If you update a subscription&#8217;s order item prices this will now be reflected in the app.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Fix a bug when an agreement is created twice on the same order. We didn&#8217;t fetch the right charge ID. This is a temporary fix I will have to revisit later on a proper setup.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Changed how we make requests to minimize the amount of times we hit Vipps&#8217; rate limits. If you have gotten a lot of exceptions lately<br \/>\nthat look like this: <code>HTTP Response Error: (recurring\/v2\/agreements\/:id\/charges) with request body: Array<\/code> it&#8217;s because of rate limits.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Errors caused by HTTP requests now have more debug information attached to them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Added an option to move renewal orders from &#8220;processing&#8221; to &#8220;completed&#8221; when the charge completes in Vipps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Truncate agreement description if it&#8217;s longer than 100 characters and truncate productName if it&#8217;s longer than 45.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Truncate initialCharge description if it&#8217;s longer than 45 characters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Added a polyfill for the PHP <code>array_key_last<\/code> function for hosts with PHP &lt; 7.3.0.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Added a &#8220;Default status to give orders with a reserved charge&#8221; option.<\/li>\n<li>Enhancement: Improved safety of reserved charges, they should never be put in an unrecoverable state anymore. Un-nested payment logic so we should never run into a similar case again.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Refunding a reversed charge now works, just like pending charges in version 1.3.9.<\/li>\n<li>Change: &#8220;Default status to give pending renewal orders&#8221; default is now &#8220;processing&#8221; instead of &#8220;on hold&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Change: Removed &#8220;completed&#8221; as a possible default status for the &#8220;Default status to give pending renewal orders&#8221; setting as this status is conventionally used for orders that are completely finished.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/vipps-recurring-payments-gateway-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2249800\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/vipps-recurring-payments-gateway-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2249800\" alt=\"Setup and activate the payment gateway in WooCommerce\"><\/a><p>Setup and activate the payment gateway in WooCommerce<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/vipps-recurring-payments-gateway-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2249800\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/vipps-recurring-payments-gateway-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2249800\" alt=\"Configure the plugin settings\"><\/a><p>Configure the plugin settings<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Crashed the site<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/porridgefactory\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/87f28f1c95653814c2b0df9815c5ecbf?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/87f28f1c95653814c2b0df9815c5ecbf?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/porridgefactory\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">PorridgeFactory<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 14, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Very wary of using this on a production site.
