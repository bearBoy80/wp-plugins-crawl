We confirm the authenticity and legitimacy of a retailer\/store by verifying their dealer status with the brands\/manufacturers that they post and sell in their online stores.<\/p>\n<p>The Authorized Store Retailer Seal of Integrity can be used as an extension\/plugin or via direct seal code placement. Once installed, the seal and certificate verifies that the retailer\/store has been vetted and approved for all brands carried, as \u201cAuthorized\u201d by brands\/manufacturers.<\/p>\n<p>The Authorized Store seal displays retailer\/store status as \u201cActive\u201d, including name and date. When the seal is clicked, a certificate pops up displaying approval process, approval requirements and consumer assurances. A link to the Retailer\/Store Profile, located at Authorized Store provides consumers with a complete retailer\/store provided description and listed credentials.<\/p>\n<p>The Seal is for retailer\/store use in the United States or Canada, only.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Why should your store have an Authorized Store Seal of Integrity and why is it different?<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Seal, Certificate and Profile identifies your e-store as Authorized for all brands.<\/li>\n<li>Get more sales\/conversions through increased consumer confidence.<\/li>\n<li>Measure success with Certificate and Profile impressions via retailer analytics.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Most certification seals provide information related to the safe use and\/or credibility of a website. These include seals that let consumers know if a site is secure from viruses and malware, seals that signify that an online store checkout process is secured by HTTPS SSL and seals that track\/post consumer reviews\/ratings. Oddly enough, non of these seals inform consumers that they are, most importantly, buying authentic products from an authorized source.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGray Market\u201d or \u201c Diverted\u201d products are sold through numerous distribution channels. These channels include e-commerce stores\/websites and\/or well recognized sites like Amazon. It\u2019s almost impossible for a consumer to identify a legitimate source. Not anymore! An Authorized Store seal and certificate ensures consumers that they are buying authentic products from a vetted, manufacturer authorized retailer\/store.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Authorized Store Site<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.authorizedstore.com\/Online_Stores\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Retailer \/ Store Introduction<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.authorizedstore.com\/Online-Stores\/SignUp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Apply \/ SignUp<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EmPFVvkMOeg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Video Introduction<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Configure plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1467357\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1467357\" alt=\"Floating Seal Right\"><\/a><p>Floating Seal Right<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1467357\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1467357\" alt=\"Floating Seal Left\"><\/a><p>Floating Seal Left<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1467357\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1467357\" alt=\"Mid-Size Seal Footer &amp; Small Seal Center\"><\/a><p>Mid-Size Seal Footer &amp; Small Seal Center<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1467357\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1467357\" alt=\"Pop Up Certificate\"><\/a><p>Pop Up Certificate<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1467357\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1467357\" alt=\"Retailer-Store Profile\"><\/a><p>Retailer-Store Profile<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=1467357\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=1467357\" alt=\"Seal Size &amp; Color Selector\"><\/a><p>Seal Size &amp; Color Selector<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=1467357\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=1467357\" alt=\"Impression Analytics\"><\/a><p>Impression Analytics<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/authorized-store-seal.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1467357","caption":"Floating Seal Right"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1467357","caption":"Floating Seal Left"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1467357","caption":"Mid-Size Seal Footer &amp; Small Seal Center"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1467357","caption":"Pop Up Certificate"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1467357","caption":"Retailer-Store Profile"},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=1467357","caption":"Seal Size &amp; Color Selector"},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=1467357","caption":"Impression Analytics"}},"tags":{"authorized":"Authorized","authorized-retailer":"authorized retailer","authorized-store":"authorized store","merchant-seal":"merchant seal","trust-seal":"trust seal"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.cminds.com\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/authorized-store-seal\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1467357","high":false}}
