The plugin gives you a widget that allows you to put in the title, author, and url for info of the book you\u2019re reading, as well as customize the title of your widget and the default text if you\u2019re not currently reading a book. There are several other plugins that allow you to keep a more detailed archive of your reading history, and if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for those plugins take care of you beautifully. This one is if you don\u2019t need that kind of functionality, but would like to be able to quickly tell visitors what you\u2019re reading.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>To use, simply activate, click on Appearance &gt; Widgets, drag the widget into your sidebar and save.<\/p>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/what-im-currently-reading.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"reading":"reading","wp":"wp"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
