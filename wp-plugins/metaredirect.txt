You can use MetaRedirect in cases where your posts need to act as pass-through for other web destinations, either internal or external. This plugin does not have any side-effects and uses a minimal amount of resources.<\/p>\n<p>The module can be disabled from the settings page. <em>Important:<\/em> If you leave the <em>Enabled<\/em> box unchecked, the plugin will have no effect at all.<\/p>\n<p>You can configure MetaRedirect to use any custom field to hold the value of the target URL.<\/p>\n<p>You can set up the redirection to either permanent (301), or temporary (302). Using the former setting, the client browsers or search engines that hit your post&#8217;s page will <em>remember<\/em> the redirection and perform it automatically the next time they visit your post. If you use a temporary redirection instead, those clients will request the redirection anew. In other words, only use Permanent (301) redirections if you are sure that the target will never change.<\/p>\n<p>You can further configure the redirection&#8217;s trigger to be permanent or provisional. A permanent trigger will enforce the redirection automatically. A provisional trigger will only perform the redirection when a preset query parameter (see below) is found in the requested URL. For example, if you set the trigger parameter to <em>jump<\/em>, the post&#8217;s URL will be redirected if, and only if, it contains &#8220;?jump&#8221;, otherwise nothing will happen.<\/p>\n<p>The trigger parameter is a string used to trigger provisional redirections (see above). URL parameters appear after the question mark (&#8220;?&#8221;) in the URL. Though query parameters typically consists of key\/value pairs separated by an equal sign (e.g., <em>key=value<\/em>) the MetaRedirect provisional trigger only requires the key to be present (the left side of the =) and will ignore any associated value.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you can set the redirection to append custom URL parameters to the target These additional parameters need to be URL-encoded key\/value pairs; the parameters will be merged with the original URL seamlessly.<\/p>\n<h3>Roadmap<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Redirection tracking report <\/li>\n<li>Redirected posts listing page<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Donations<\/h3>\n<p>None needed.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Install the plugin and configure the redirections as needed in the MetaRedirect settings page: \/wp-admin\/admin.php?page=metaredirect_settings.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note<\/em> that the plugin is <em>not<\/em> enabled by default.
