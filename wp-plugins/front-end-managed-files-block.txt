With the Front-End Managed Files Block plugin you can make file lists that clients can manage easily via the frontend of the website.<\/p>\n<h4>MATCHES YOUR THEME<\/h4>\n<p>File blocks inherit style from whichever theme your site is using. This means they will look great with minimal or no CSS tweaking required.<\/p>\n<h4>CREATE WITH CLASSIC &amp; GUTENBERG EDITORS<\/h4>\n<p>The Front-End Managed Files Block plugin supports the creation of blocks via both the Classic and Gutenberg editors. The Classic editor has a menu dropdown which allows for inserting a file block with ease. The Gutenberg editor has a custom block which makes adding and customising file blocks quick and easy, you can also add or remove files while inside the editor.<\/p>\n<h4>IT&#8217;S JUST A SHORTCODE<\/h4>\n<p>File blocks at their core are just a shortcode \u2013 so remain usable with third party page editors. You can even include them inside a widget.<\/p>\n<h4>NO MEDIA CLUTTER<\/h4>\n<p>Uploaded files are stored directly in the database and don\u2019t clutter your media library with unnecessary files.<\/p>\n<h4>CUSTOMISE<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>List Sorting \u2013 Sort file blocks by name, upload date, size and type.<\/li>\n<li>Disable File Icons \u2013 File blocks will show a file type icon by default \u2013 this can be disabled per files block.<\/li>\n<li>Restrict User Access \u2013 Allow only specific users permission to upload and delete, these can even be non-editors. <strong>Pro Version Only<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Restrict File Types \u2013 Allow only the file types you want to be uploaded, per files block. <strong>Pro Version Only<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>HELP &amp;
