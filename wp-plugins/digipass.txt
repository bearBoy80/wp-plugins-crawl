This is because otherwise it is easy to become confused about where a problem is emanating from. Although with smaller plugins and changes you can normally batch test, when a plugin makes such big changes to certain aspects of your sites functionality, solo testing is highly recommended.<\/p>\n<h4>Minimum Requirements<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 3.5 or greater<\/li>\n<li>PHP version 5.2.4 or greater<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>via Upload (FTP, SCP etc.)<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the extracted archive folder &#8216;digipass&#8217; to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li><em>(optional)<\/em> Go to &#8220;Settings &gt; DigiPass&#8221; to adjust settings<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>via WordPress Admin<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to &#8220;Plugins &gt; Add New&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Search for <code>DigiPass<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Install the plugin called <code>DigiPass<\/code> and activate it<\/li>\n<li>Go to &#8220;Settings &gt; DigiPass&#8221; to adjust settings (optional)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>How do I adjust the Plugin Settings?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you have activated the plugin you can tinker with the settings to your heart\u2019s content.
