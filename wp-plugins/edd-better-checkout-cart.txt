( depending from the websites we tested the cart abandon rate was 60-70%, after the make over we arrived to a very low 38% in a case and around 40-44% in others).<br \/>\nThat was done by removing useless call-to-actions and other distraction and adding some content (social proof mainly). <br \/>\nThis plugin is an important stepson to get that improvement. <br \/>\nSee on our <a href=\"http:\/\/tantra.marketing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website TantraMarkting<\/a>  what we did.<\/p>\n<p><strong> Important about Support<\/strong><br \/>\nThe plugins is as-it-is.
