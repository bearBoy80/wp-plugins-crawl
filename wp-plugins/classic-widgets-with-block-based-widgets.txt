With this plugin, you can access the Classic Widgets screen in <code>Appearance &gt; Classic Widgets<\/code> and the block-based screen at the usual place in <code>Appearance &gt; Widgets<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:-<\/strong><br \/>\nThis plugin uses WordPress filters to create a new classic widget screen. That means it will work as long as WordPress supports the Classic Widgets screen.<\/p>\n<h4>Links<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/5um17\/classic-widgets-with-block-based-widgets\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ul>\n<li>Install <em>Classic Widgets with Block-based Widgets<\/em> from the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; section in your dashboard (Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Search for &#8216;Classic Widgets with Block-based Widgets&#8217;).<br \/>\nOr<br \/>\nDownload <em>Classic Widgets with Block-based Widgets<\/em> and upload it to your webserver via your FTP application.
