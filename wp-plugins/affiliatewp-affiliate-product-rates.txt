For integrations that support per-product referral rates, affiliates can earn different commissions based on which product\/s are purchased. AffiliateWP also allows you to set referral rates on a per-affiliate level which will override any per-product referral rate.<\/p>\n<p>Affiliate Product Rates expands this even further, allowing different per-product referral rates on a per-affiliate level.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of how you might use this plugin:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Give Affiliate X 10% commission for Product A, 80% commission for Product B, and a flat rate of $50 for Product C.<\/li>\n<li>Give Affiliate Y 50% commission for Product A, but a lower commission than Affiliate X for Products B and C.<\/li>\n<li>Give Affiliate Z a flat-rate of $10 commission for Product A, 65% commission for Product B and 22% commission for Product C.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The possibilities are endless! You can also set per-product referral rates per-affiliate per-integration! (for those that happen to be running both integrations listed below).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Currently Supported Integrations<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Easy Digital Downloads<\/li>\n<li>WooCommerce<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Known Issues<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The add-on doesn\u2019t yet prevent a product from existing in more than 1 product rate.

When I inquired with their support they stated that I would have to go to Code Canyon and pay for the rest of the integration I required. This was going to cost me over a $1,000USD. AffilateWP offered a refund but never actually provided the refund.
