Now once, your user has logged into buddypress, he will be redirected to his\/her profile. So, you dont need seperate plugin which redirects the user to profile on logging in. Secondly everytime user clicks on homepage links or logo of your website, he will be redirected to his\/her profile which makes easy accessiblity of own profile to the user and more over there is no need to show register link to logged in user.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Any conflicts with this plugin ?<br \/>\nAns: It may have conflicts with the plugins who offer redirections for buddypress plugin<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Just developed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.2<\/h4>\n<p>added log out redirection<\/p>\n<h4>0.3<\/h4>\n<p>log out redirection bug fixed<\/p>\n<h4>0.4<\/h4>\n<p>enabled for Buddypress installations within the directory. which means if your blog is not installed on root domain, still you can use this plugin.<\/p>\n<h4>0.5<\/h4>\n<p>Many themes were creating problem for redirection, so changes made so that redirection can work in any case<\/p>\n<h4>0.6<\/h4>\n<p>added option to select the user role who can view the homepage.<\/p>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<p>updated to work with latest wordpress and buddypress editions<\/p>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<p>Fixed bugs for wordpress 4.1 and buddypress 2.1.1. thanks to John Clause<\/p>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Exactly does what it says<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jordib\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/42706de497e8e22ee213d9c0437f879a?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/42706de497e8e22ee213d9c0437f879a?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jordib\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">jordib<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 7, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I have installed this plugin and for the moment it's working exactly how is explained.\n\nI was looking for a plugin like this.
