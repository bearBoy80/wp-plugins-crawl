Goto homepage of the website. This will trigger the plugin to contact Kunato Servers to start evaluating the content.<\/p>\n<p>Kunato.ai plugin relies on Kunato servers to crawl the web pages in order to generate valuation based on content. Kunato Crawler only send one web request to your website at a time and does not overload a website with parallel crawling. A downside of conservative crawling is that it takes time to crawl all the pages on a website. So, please be patient when activating the plugin for the first time. The prices usually start coming in a few minutes.<\/p>\n<p>If the prices do not start coming in 15 minutes, then ensure that the SEO and firewall requirements, as described below, are met.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incorrect SEO or not having a Search Engine Optimization will result in the prices not coming for articles. Installing any common SEO plugin, such as Yoast SEO, will solve this issue.<\/li>\n<li>Usage of a network firewall can result in some pages getting a price and some not. To ensure all pages get priced, whitelist the IP <code>128.199.27.211<\/code> in the firewall settings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Additional help<\/h3>\n<p>For more info contact support@kunato.io<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='why%20are%20prices%20not%20showing%3F'>\nWhy are prices not showing?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Usually, the prices start coming in 5 minutes if the website has proper SEO and Kunato servers are not being blocked by a firewall.
