As a result, once the order is placed, the customer doesn&#8217;t see the discount they got in the email or invoice they receive, and the admin doesn&#8217;t see this in the order details either.<br \/>\nThis is because WooCommerce only considers <em>coupon discounts<\/em> as discounts, whereas a change in price (a sale price or a programmatically modified price) is simply regarded as the actual price of the product.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin addresses that issue by copying the &#8216;regular price&#8217; from the product data as soon as the order is created (either in the backend or via the checkout). This price is then set as the item&#8217;s &#8220;pre-discount&#8221; price (leaving the actual price paid untouched). The result is that WooCommerce will show this the same way it shows coupon discounts.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='something%20is%20not%20working%20correctly'>\nSomething is not working correctly\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please post a message to our <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/plugin\/sale-discount-for-woocommerce\/\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum<\/a> and we&#8217;ll do our best to help resolve your issue!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20contribute%20to%20this%20project%3F'>\nHow can I contribute to this project?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This project is hosted on github: https:\/\/github.com\/wpovernight\/sale-discount-for-woocommerce<br \/>\nIf you want to contribute to the code, feel free to submit a PR.
