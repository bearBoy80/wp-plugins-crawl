In these new versions, the top &#8220;admin bar&#8221; is shown on the public site by default for all users. This has been inconvenient on some of the sites we manage, where the WordPress admin area is otherwise &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; for some logged in users, or where the top admin bar is incompatible with the site\u2019s layout.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>To solve this problem, Clean Admin Bar Removal disables the toolbar in existing users&#8217; preferences and changes the default setting for new users. Once a site administrator installs the plugin, they can choose which behavior to use on their site by user role. Users can restore the admin bar in their individual preferences by choosing &#8220;Show Toolbar when viewing site&#8221; if needed.<\/p>\n<p>I hope some of you find this plugin helpful. It is offered for free under the GPL-2 license with no support or warranty, but has already been put into production on several of our sites and is working well.

This plugin, though it hasn't been updated for two years as of this writing, still works well on the current Wordpress platform I'm using.<\/p>\n<p>It has easy to find controls (under tools) and allows you to set different permissions regarding what user level sees the admin bar or not on your site. Other plugins tend to overdo hiding the bar by removing it entirely on both front <em>and<\/em> back ends, with little to no control on how it's done. I wanted an easy plugin that would hide the bar only on the front end for the roles chosen and this turned out to be among the best I've found. Simple, easy, and intuitive. No hidden controls or buggy behavior. Give it a try.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/clean-admin-bar-removal.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/clean-admin-bar-removal\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1566888","caption":"Settings &gt; Clean Admin Bar"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/clean-admin-bar-removal\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1566888","caption":"The Admin Bar this plugin this plugin refers to"}},"tags":{"admin-bar":"admin bar","preferences":"preferences","settings":"settings","toolbar":"toolbar"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.dwolla.com\/u\/812-725-2609","banners":[]}
