For example, some of you modified the ita-version variable,<br \/>\nthis is used to detect upgradability, if you&#8217;re using 0.5.2 please set it to 0.1 before proceeding with the upgrade.  On this, future<br \/>\nversions from (0.5.3 forward) will set this to the current version number, it was supposed to just be a database version number, but<br \/>\nall these different version numbers are obviously confusing people (me included), so from now on everything to do with iTALM will carry<br \/>\nthe version number of the plugin it came from (this includes the plugin for tinyMCE support).<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unzip the contents of the zip file<\/li>\n<li>Upload the <code>itunes-affiliate-link-maker<\/code> directory to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory on your website<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Goto settings to setup the plugin<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Upgrading from previous versions? backup prior to running the upgrade procedure.<br \/>\n0.5 and up now uses the [itunes] shorttag to drop links in, you can type them or search as per normal via<br \/>\neither editor.
