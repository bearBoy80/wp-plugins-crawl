This<br \/>\ndistinguishes Persistent Forking from the <em>Post Forking<\/em> plugin,<br \/>\nwhere forks are a collaborative tool in order to arrive at a single<br \/>\ndefinitive version. The parent-child relationships between posts are<br \/>\ntracked and it is possible to visualise the entire family tree of a<br \/>\npost.<\/p>\n<h3>Support<\/h3>\n<p>Please report any issue that you find while using the plugin at our<br \/>\nGitHub repository:<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/github.com\/UUDigitalHumanitieslab\/persistent-forking\/issues<\/p>\n<p>The first priority of the Digital Humanities Lab is to service<br \/>\nrequests from Humanities researchers at Utrecht University.
