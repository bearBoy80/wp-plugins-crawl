Here you set up to 10 different dates for your post to be associated with. Through a sidebar widget you control how to display posts that have upcoming dates set to them.

Pick dates to make the post available in the calendar. Set up the Calendar Posts widget under Appearace &gt; Widgets and posts will appear in a Calendar in your sidebar.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Where is the widget?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Under <code>wp-admin\/widgets.php<\/code>. It&#8217;s called Calendar Posts.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Where is the settings panel?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s none. You configure the calendar on each widget directly. There are some configurable vars at the top inside the plugin&#8217;s php-script file (for developers).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Where is that CSS code mentioned in the description?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s here:<\/p>\n<pre><code>.cp-month {\n    padding: 8px 0px 5px 0px;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    font-size: 1.2em;\n}\n.cp-date-div {\n    margin: 0.4em 0px;\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/p>\n<h4>The month names are shown in English even though WordPress is set to a different language?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Since PHP is showing month abbrevations wrong (typographicly) you have to set custom month names on your own at the top of the script file. Sorry. This is something I had to do since PHP&#8217;s abbrevations always appear with three letters which is wrong.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I change how month names are shown?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This can be acheived inside the plugins php file. You should know some PHP and you&#8217;ll find how to add your own month abbrevations at the top of the script file.
