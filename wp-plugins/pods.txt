(@sc0ttkclark)<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Resolved PHP 8.3 deprecation notice with <code>get_class()<\/code> usage. #7225 (@netlas, @sc0ttkclark)<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: File fields using the direct plupload option will properly avoid uploading files above the limit and handle uploading multiple files without losing all but the first file in the file list. #7138 (@sc0ttkclark, @PD-CM) <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.0.9 &#8211; December 7th, 2023<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Feature: Added support for disabling Quick Edit for custom post types for sites on WP 6.4+.

(@sc0ttkclark)<\/li>\n<li>Tweak: Updated the default values used for &#8220;Add New&#8221; labels to use &#8220;Add New {singularLabel}&#8221; instead to follow WP core&#8217;s direction. (@sc0ttkclark) <\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Custom capability types now save as empty and remain empty as intended.

(@sc0ttkclark)<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Add new options to trim content of fields by removing empty p tags, trimming whitespace at the end of lines, and removing extra lines. Default those to off (previously they were just always on). (@sc0ttkclark)<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Add <code>tribe()<\/code> backward compatibilty function for Pods add-ons that still call that function. This only gets included by Pods when Tribe Common is not detected on the site.

complex projects) The major issue is, that Pods is not working with WordPress, but working around it. Means, it doesn't integrate into WordPress (and plugins) very well. You have custom, non-intuitive functions for everything Pods related. So you eventually have to write a lot of custom code instead.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">It gives you more problems than solving. Whenever there is a new requirement where Pods is involved, it needs much more resources to get resolved.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">The second major issue is, that the overall (code) quality of pods is terrible. Every update is a risk. It has a lot of technical debt, you will inherit using pods. Personally, it got more obvious after learning that Caldera Forms and Pods are from the same person originally. Unfortunately, I had to customize Caldera Forms too, which really was a burden\u2026 Clever ideas, but unmaintainable code\u2026<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Doesn&#039;t work with Elementor - Buggy<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/billunderwood\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9933beeaa23237cad9486bad050df4ab?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9933beeaa23237cad9486bad050df4ab?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/billunderwood\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">billunderwood<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 13, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Fails in many ways with Elementor and has entry bugs with plain Wordpress.
