This also offers support assistance when a version rollback is detected, which usually indicates that the user is experiencing issues with a newer version of the plugin.<\/li>\n<li>New <code>Admin_Notices<\/code> class to handle displaying of admin notices. All notices are respectful in that they are either displayed once or dismissible.<\/li>\n<li>New <code>Errors\\No_Authorization<\/code> exception type class to fix class name and file inconsistency.<\/li>\n<li>New <code>Autoloader<\/code> class to autoload class files.<\/li>\n<li>New REST API endpoints to replace all WP Admin AJAX actions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Changed<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Remote updates are now handled through WordPress.org. See the official plugin listing at <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/completionist\/\" rel=\"ugc\">https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/completionist\/<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Class declarations are no longer wrapped in <code>if ( class_exists( ... ) )<\/code> checks. All classes are properly namespaced and should not normally cause collisions.<\/li>\n<li>Upgraded the legacy Tasks metabox within the Classic Editor. This offers great UX\/UI and performance improvements, matching the Pinned Tasks panel in the Block Editor. This also removes script dependencies on jQuery.<\/li>\n<li>All admin scripts are now loaded in the document footer.<\/li>\n<li>The <code>global $submenu<\/code> is no longer modified in wp-admin to change the main menu page&#8217;s submenu title to &#8220;Settings&#8221;. Instead, it&#8217;s now explicitly added as a duplicate submenu page with the overridden title.<\/li>\n<li>Refactored <code>Automation::to_stdClass()<\/code> to <code>Automation::to_std_class()<\/code> for proper snake casing per WordPress Coding Standards.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Removed<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>YahnisElsts\/plugin-update-checker<\/code> Composer package which facilitated remote updates. Remote updates are now hosted by WordPress.org.<\/li>\n<li>The <code>uninstall.php<\/code> file. Data is now uninstalled by using the registered uninstall hook.<\/li>\n<li>The deprecated <code>Request_Tokens<\/code> class file, options, and other references.<\/li>\n<li>The <code>Errors\\NoAuthorization<\/code> class due to inconsistent naming and class file.<\/li>\n<li>All <code>require_once<\/code> calls which manually included class files. The new <code>Autoloader<\/code> class now handles this.<\/li>\n<li>All WP Admin AJAX actions to instead use the new REST API endpoints.<\/li>\n<li>The <code>HTML_Builder::format_task_row()<\/code> function. It was only used by the legacy Tasks metabox within the Classic Editor, which is now replaced by the upgraded ReactJS-based components.<\/li>\n<li>The <code>Task_Categorizer<\/code> class, all child classes, and the <code>Task_Categorizer<\/code> namespace. These PHP classes have not been used since this functionality was moved to ReactJS on the frontend.<\/li>\n<li>Non-class files within the <code>src\/admin<\/code> directory. All PHP+HTML template code has been moved to methods within the related PHP classes, either <code>Admin_Pages<\/code> or <code>Admin_Widgets<\/code>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Fixed<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Unpinning a task from the post editor would unpin the task across the entire site.<\/li>\n<li>Some edge-case oddities with the WP Admin AJAX actions for managing tasks. The new REST API endpoints are now more robust after a thorough code review and refactor.<\/li>\n<li>Searching for posts in an Automation Action&#8217;s &#8220;Pin to Post&#8221; field would include WordPress&#8217;s internal types such as <code>wp_navigation<\/code> and <code>wp_global_styles<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>The Asana Data Cache Duration (TTL) could not be set to 0 seconds.<\/li>\n<li>Resolve console errors and warnings in React scripts logged when <code>SCRIPT_DEBUG<\/code> is enabled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Security<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Various improvements with the new REST API endpoints which replace the original WP Admin AJAX actions.<\/li>\n<li>Unique nonces to authorize different requests to the new REST API endpoints which replace the original WP Admin AJAX actions.<\/li>\n<li>Searching for posts in an Automation Action&#8217;s &#8220;Pin to Post&#8221; field would include posts that the current user did not have permission to read.<\/li>\n<li>Improve sanitization of nonce values before validation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3.11.0 &#8211; 2023-11-19<\/h3>\n<h4>Added<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New PHP filter hook <code>ptc_completionist_project_task_fields<\/code> to edit the task fields that will be retrieved for each task in an Asana project.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3.10.2 &#8211; 2023-10-10<\/h3>\n<h4>Changed<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Clearing the Asana Data Cache no longer completely deletes all request tokens, so it&#8217;s now compatible with frontend page caching.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Fixed<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Media attachments with uppercase file suffix, such as <code>JPG<\/code> or <code>PNG<\/code>, would not be displayed in Project Embeds.<\/li>\n<li>Style issues on the Settings screen when using Chrome with the Loom browser extension.<\/li>\n<li>Error 404 when using the new Asana project URL as the <code>src<\/code> in Project Embeds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=3007881\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=3007881\" alt=\"Pin new or existing Asana tasks to any WordPress content, such as posts and pages or even products and forms.\"><\/a><p>Pin new or existing Asana tasks to any WordPress content, such as posts and pages or even products and forms.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=3007881\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=3007881\" alt=\"Track all pinned tasks across your WordPress website and quickly access relevant content\u2014a must-have feature for web agencies, especially!\"><\/a><p>Track all pinned tasks across your WordPress website and quickly access relevant content\u2014a must-have feature for web agencies, especially!<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=3007881\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=3007881\" alt=\"Automatically create Asana tasks as you work in WordPress, such as notifying editors that a post is ready for final review.\"><\/a><p>Automatically create Asana tasks as you work in WordPress, such as notifying editors that a post is ready for final review.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=3007881\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=3007881\" alt=\"Display Asana projects on your WordPress website to automatically keep everyone in the loop, even those without an Asana account.\"><\/a><p>Display Asana projects on your WordPress website to automatically keep everyone in the loop, even those without an Asana account.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/completionist.4.0.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=3007881","caption":"Pin new or existing Asana tasks to any WordPress content, such as posts and pages or even products and forms."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=3007881","caption":"Track all pinned tasks across your WordPress website and quickly access relevant content\u2014a must-have feature for web agencies, especially!"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=3007881","caption":"Automatically create Asana tasks as you work in WordPress, such as notifying editors that a post is ready for final review."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=3007881","caption":"Display Asana projects on your WordPress website to automatically keep everyone in the loop, even those without an Asana account."}},"tags":{"asana":"asana","management":"management","manager":"manager","project":"project","task":"task"},"versions":{"4.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/completionist.4.0.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/completionist.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=3007881","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/completionist\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=3007881"}}
