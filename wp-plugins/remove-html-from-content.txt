I set an automatic forwarding filter in my email to my website via WordPress' post-by-email function, assisted by the Postie plugin. <\/p>\n<p>That worked well but it had \"unsubscribe\" info at the bottom of the email -- what if someone clicked the \"unsubscribe\" link?  <\/p>\n<p>So I added the Text Obfuscator plugin to filter out the explanatory text, which was great, but it left the actual link since it didn't filter out HTML. So that was a problem. <\/p>\n<p>But then, this plugin was recommended to me, and it worked perfectly. <\/p>\n<p>Problem solved. Thank you, developer!<\/p>\n<p>Note that this removes all HTML from being presented publicly, which includes all posts, new or old, including certain formatting, like bold and blockquotes. It doesn't actually remove the HTML from the post (i.e., you can view the HTML using the text edit window for composing the post), so you can try and if it isn't working for you, you can deactivate it, and your posts will revert to their previous state.<\/p>\n<p>While it would be nice if there were some filtering options, like Text Obfuscator has, or a way to turn it off for particular posts, it does exactly what it promises.
