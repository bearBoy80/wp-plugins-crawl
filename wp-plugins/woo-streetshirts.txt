So it adds products at least. I had to point out to them that woocommerce are not going to do anything about their broken plugin before I got someone on email\/chat that actually had a vague idea of what they're doing. \n\nIt still needs a massive overhaul as it's three years out of date. Just because it sort of works doesn't mean it doesn't need work. I suspect the developer has left the company. \n\nI'm not hugely confident it's going to work in terms of order, so I'll do a test and update again.\n\nOriginal Review:\nNo longer working - out of date by about three years and Street Shirts have so far told me to Woo Commerce who I know are going to tell me to go to the plugin developer...Streetshirts.\n\nSome of the instructions are invalid, and the tools both literally say depreciated and I suspect the price list is out of date too.\n\nIf this changes, I'll let people know but I would hold off on downloading and installing.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-streetshirts.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-streetshirts\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1678434","caption":"Create your products in our t-shirt designer and add to woocommerce in one-click"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-streetshirts\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1678434","caption":"Variants are created automatically for you"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-streetshirts\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1678434","caption":"A custom order action allows you to quickly send an order for fulfilment (or enable auto-send)"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-streetshirts\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1678434","caption":"Our order number and charge is added an internal note to the order"}},"tags":{"street-shirts":"street shirts","streetshirts":"streetshirts","t-shirts":"t-shirts","woo":"woo","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-streetshirts.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-streetshirts.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-streetshirts.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-streetshirts.1.0.3.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-streetshirts\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1678434","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-streetshirts\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1678434"}}
