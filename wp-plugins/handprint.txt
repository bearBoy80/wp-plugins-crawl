Once set up, a &#8220;widget&#8221; displays your impact (e.g. how much CO2 captured by your trees or how much plastic removed from coastal areas) on your Cart page, so your customers can see you&#8217;re a company that cares about the planet.<\/p>\n<p>Why use Handprint plugin?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using the plugin is free, you only pay your impact.<\/li>\n<li>Brand image: customers increasingly demand that businesses become more sustainable and they are voting with their wallets.

Our plan is to add more projects until all 17 Sustainable Development Goals can be easily supported through Handprint.
