Are they compressed?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress doesn&#8217;t currently support PNG compression internally (none at all). There are other image-handling plugins that compress PNGs and GIFs, but they either require server-side tools or a 3rd-party service. For a Plugin using server-side tools, try &#8216;EWWW Image Optimizer&#8217;. For a Plugin using a 3rd-party service, try &#8216;WP Smush.it&#8217;.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How can I update JPEGs uploaded before installing this plugin at a different setting?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, install this plugin and choose your new compression level. Then install the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin, https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/regenerate-thumbnails\/, and run it. All the regenerated thumbnails will be compressed at the compression % from this plugin.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What happens to uploaded images if I turn the plugin off?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Images uploaded while the plugin was active will stay at their original\/old compression level (to recompress them, I recommend the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin). After you deactivate the custom compression setting will be removed and all new images will use WP&#8217;s default 90% compression setting.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>2.1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility checks for WordPress 3.9<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevent blank image &amp; PHP-type error when compression-level set to 0%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add handling of the &#8216;wp_editor_set_quality&#8217; filter that was added in WP 3.5 for ImageMagick API<\/li>\n<li>Update styles to use colors from WP3.8 admin themes<\/li>\n<li>Docs &amp; screenshot reflect new placement of slider on the Settings &gt; Media admin page<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Move image compression toggle from custom Settings &gt; Image Quality page to Settings &gt; Media<\/li>\n<li>Add note to current custom Admin page that UX will permanently move to Settings &gt; Media in v3.0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>(attempted) Fix WP.org screenshot display<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed JS error in wp-admin pages, show our JS only in own wp-admin page<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-resized-image-quality\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=826418\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-resized-image-quality\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=826418\" alt=\"No complicated media\/compression interface.
