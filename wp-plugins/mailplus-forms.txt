That key is neccessary to activate the plugin with your account.\n\nThe form is shown as it's a list (so dots before every field or button)\nThe form shows the calculating check, that is supposed to run on the background, but through the plugin is always visible (also as a list item) very annoying.\n\nThey don't provide a list of fieldnames so adding CSS is not as easy as it should be.\nThey don't update the plugin. So it doesn't feel safe.\n\nI think with a little extra effort they can make it work a lot better.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mailplus-forms.1.2.5.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"forms":"forms","mailplus":"mailplus","spotler":"spotler","spotler-mail-forms":"spotler mail+ forms"},"versions":{"1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mailplus-forms.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mailplus-forms.1.2.zip","1.2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mailplus-forms.1.2.1.zip","1.2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mailplus-forms.1.2.2.zip","1.2.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mailplus-forms.1.2.3.zip","1.2.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mailplus-forms.1.2.4.zip","1.2.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mailplus-forms.1.2.5.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mailplus-forms.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.spotler.com\/software","banners":[]}
