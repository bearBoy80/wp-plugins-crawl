Comment Guardian is an innovative spam protection that eliminates 99.9% of comment spam. This plugin goes the radical way. It analyzes the language in which the comment was written and allows only languages that you have previously approved. For example, if you have a German website with a German blog, you can be absolutely sure that English or even Russian comments will be spam. Comment Guardian will automatically mark all comments that are not written in German as spam.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does Comment Guardian work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>First, in the Comment Guardian settings, you specify the languages you want to allow for comments. After a comment is created, a complex algorithm checks in which language the comment was written. If the language is not one you have approved, Comment Guardian will mark the comment as spam.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is Comment Guardian something for me?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It depends. This plugin goes the radical way to protect you from spam. This plugin is absolutely for you if the spam messages are not in the language of your blog. For example, if you have a German website with a German blog, you can be absolutely sure that English or even Russian comments will be spam. Comment Guardian will automatically mark all comments that are not written in German as spam.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does Comment Guardian cost anything?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No, the plugin is free of charge. Spam is annoying. So I&#8217;m happy to contribute to remove yours \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p><strong>I have questions. Is there any support?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sure. Just write me at info@codepa.de<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>The setup is very simple.
