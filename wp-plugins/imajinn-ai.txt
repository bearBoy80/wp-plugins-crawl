Paul Hendricks<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Prompt Genie<\/h3>\n<p>Prompt Genie is a powerful AI tool that can help you generate better prompts for your images. Just enter a few simple words to describe what you would like to create, then summon Prompt Genie to use it&#8217;s custom-trained machine learning model to turn your boring prompts into amazingly artistic images. Prompt Genie is a great way to create fantastic images with Imajinn without having to learn the complex skill of prompt building that&#8217;s necessary to use other tools like DALLE or Stable Diffusion.<\/p>\n<h3>Touchup (Inpainting)<\/h3>\n<p>Touchup mode allows you to customize and make modifications to an image in a more precise way by allowing you to remove or replace parts of the image with new content generated from your prompt. This is useful for removing unwanted objects like watermarks, signatures, or duplicates. Or you can use it to add new objects to the image, such as a forground item or background. Touchup allows you to create the exact image you want by choosing where each element in the image goes. You can create that complex image you have in mind, even if it is too specific to get right with one initial prompt.<\/p>\n<p>Touchup works by choosing an image as an input, masking an area with the brush that you want to modify, then adjusting your prompt to describe what you want in that area.<\/p>\n<h3>Privacy<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin does not collect or share data other than your prompts and generated images as needed to run our API service.

You will be prompted to create a free account or connect to your existing account right in the block, and then you can start generating images right away.<\/p>\n<p>Running an artificial intelligence neural network requires a lot of computing power. To make this possible, we run a cloud service to run the neural network. This means that you need to connect to our service before you can use the plugin. To connect to Imajinn AI, you need to have a user account. You can create one for free with just your valid email address and a password, or if you already have an account, you can log in with your Infinite Uploads\/Imajinn AI email and password.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='what%20is%20it%20good%20at%20generating%3F'>\nWhat is it good at generating?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This AI model can create some amazing images with the right guidance. It especially excels at more artistic images such as paintings, drawings, CG, etc. Think stock photos or art.<\/p>\n<p>It struggles a bit with photorealistic human faces and body parts, which can appear strangely deformed. This can be avoided by choosing a more artistic style or close-up portrait. Also, if you ask it to generate text the letters are usually mangled or mixed up.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20imajinn%20ai%20plugin%20free%3F'>\nIs the Imajinn AI plugin free?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>While the plugin is free and can be used on unlimited sites, it does require an account with our cloud service to power the extremely computation-heavy AI algorithms.

You can also upgrade to one of our paid plans for more image generation credits, at a fraction of the cost of stock photo sites.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20copyright%20license%20of%20images%20i%20create%3F'>\nWhat is the copyright license of images I create?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>All generated images that comply with our service usage terms are public domain and are yours to license as you see fit.
