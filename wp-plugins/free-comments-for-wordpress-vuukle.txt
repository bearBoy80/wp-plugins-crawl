They were really nice and helpful but I really have to mention this till they change their website and plugin information in here.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nThey definitely have limitations and those limitations are not clear. I don't blame them this is happening for the reason they are still learning. They limit usage till site get 100K or 250K or around hits. And this is not declared in any part I saw\n\n\nADS\nAfter the free usage limit like 250K hit, They start to add advertisements from Google Ads and similar areas. I think this is pretty dangerous because they clearly declared they can send ads without giving any permission from this plugin directly. So, I can not be sure when they will start do it or not. Or I can not be sure if they start to do it before 250K hit limit or not. I tihnk this sort of violates Wordpress plugin repositery rules. I will check it later.\n\nSo, I highly suggest be careful for who wants to use this. Also I suggest to the developrs please be more clear for limitations and for the advertisements.\n\n* To developers: I'm sorry as I have to do it like as you were very nice to me on support chat. We must have some rules and clear declarations in this plugin place.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.1.7.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2884670","caption":"Advertisement"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2884670","caption":"Analytics dashboard"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=2884670","caption":"Comments widget"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=2884670","caption":"Listen widget"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle\/assets\/screenshot-5.jpg?rev=2884670","caption":"Reaction widget"},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle\/assets\/screenshot-6.jpg?rev=2884670","caption":"Social share bar"},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle\/assets\/screenshot-7.jpg?rev=2884670","caption":"Web Push notifications"},"8":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle\/assets\/screenshot-8.png?rev=2919971","caption":"Quiz widget"}},"tags":{"comments":"comments","emojis":"emojis","fb-comments":"fb comments","reactions":"reactions","sharebar":"sharebar"},"versions":{"1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.1.1.zip","3.4.31":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.3.4.31.zip","4.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.4.0.1.zip","4.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.4.0.2.zip","4.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.4.0.3.zip","4.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.4.0.4.zip","4.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.4.0.5.zip","4.0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.4.0.6.zip","4.0.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.4.0.7.zip","4.0.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.4.0.8.zip","5.0.10":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.0.10.zip","5.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.0.2.zip","5.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.0.3.zip","5.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.0.4.zip","5.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.0.5.zip","5.0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.0.6.zip","5.0.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.0.7.zip","5.0.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.0.8.zip","5.0.9":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.0.9.zip","5.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.1.0.zip","5.1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.1.1.zip","5.1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.1.2.zip","5.1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.1.3.zip","5.1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.1.4.zip","5.1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.1.5.zip","5.1.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.1.6.zip","5.1.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.5.1.7.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2055046","high":false}}
