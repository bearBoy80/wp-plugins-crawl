In reverse, it cannot get such data from Abrestan. Based on my experience, the plugin has a limit access to the web service and developers does not share the web service documents as I asked them. Moreover there are some bugs in the plugin and consequently, I preferred to remove it. In my opinion, the plugin needs more development.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/abrestan.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"accounting-cloud-abrestan":"accounting cloud abrestan"},"versions":{"2.1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/abrestan.2.1.3.zip","2.2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/abrestan.2.2.0.zip","2.2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/abrestan.2.2.1.zip","2.2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/abrestan.2.2.2.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/abrestan\/assets\/banner-772\u00d7250.jpg?rev=2597535","high":false}}
