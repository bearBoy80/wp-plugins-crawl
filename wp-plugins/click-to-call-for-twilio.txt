You need to configure yourself the incoming routes for both voice and text in your Twilio dashboard. The plugin comes with flexible shortcodes to add the widget anywhere on your WP website.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, this Twilio Plugin is a connector between your WordPress website and your Twilio numbers. We know that visitors don&#8217;t like to fill in long and intrusive contact forms, that is why we believe this is a great addition for those who need to decrease their interaction time with the website visitors and to grow their lead generation. With just a single phone input you can get connected to support, sales reps in less than 5 seconds! You can also use plugin&#8217;s SMS\/MMS shortcodes to send your website visitors promotions, specials, directions, instructions or anything you like &#8211; directly on their mobile phones.<\/p>\n<p>In order to get Click-to-Call for Twilio to work, you need to add your Twilio ACCOUNT SID and AUTH TOKEN. Basically these are the keys that will grant plugin access to your Twilio Cloud Infrastructure and will help to initiate voice or text actions.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a Twilio account don\u2019t worry, setting up an account is very simple and you can get your trial credentials in a matter of seconds. You can find a very comprehensive video tutorial <a href=\"https:\/\/twilio.dasweb.ca\/general-settings\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Obtaining the Twilio SID and AUTH tokens<\/h3>\n<p>After you have your Twilio account set up navigate to your main <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twilio.com\/console\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twilio Dashboard<\/a> and copy your credentials into the general settings of the plugin.<\/p>\n<h3>Adding a Click-to-Call shortcode<\/h3>\n<p>To add a shortcode of your Click-to-Call button simply add the following to any part of your WordPress page or visual editor:<\/p>\n<pre><code>[twtcall label='Click To Call' number='+1501222333']\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Notice that by default the label for the button is \u2018Click to Call\u2019 which you can change to whatever is the best for you. The second part of the shortcode is the default Voice number that you set up in the Settings page. You can overwrite it with another Voice capable number that you have in your Twilio account.<\/p>\n<p>You can find more in the <a href=\"https:\/\/twilio.dasweb.ca\/documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Documentation<\/a> section on our website and you can also test the <a href=\"https:\/\/twilio.dasweb.ca\/click-to-call-for-wordpress\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Demo<\/a> of the Click-to-Call functionality.<\/p>\n<h3>Pro Version<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twilio.dasweb.ca\/shop\/twilio-wordpress-tools-pro\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The Pro Version<\/a> offers you a full integration of the SMS\/MMS and Fax options and offers you more options, customization and 6 months of free support.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click-to-Call feature \u2013 Direct contact with your website visitors<\/li>\n<li>SMS\/MMS functionality \u2013 Capture visitors\u2019 phone numbers and send marketing\/contact info<\/li>\n<li>vCards sent to visitors \u2013 Send visitors your contact information in a phone-ready format<\/li>\n<li>Fax outbound feature \u2013 Use it internally as a virtual fax machine to send documents <strong>[discontinued by Twilio]<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Custom Voice Message \u2013 Write your own welcome message when placing click-to-call actions<\/li>\n<li>Custom Countries Flags \u2013 Select the countries you want to be visible in the input field<\/li>\n<li>WPMU\/Translations \u2013 Ability to translate the plugin strings in different languages<\/li>\n<li>6 months Free Support \u2013 Include installation and technical support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<h3>Using the WordPress dashboard<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>First, download the zip file containing Click-to-Call for Twilio Plugin.

I bought the pro version which I highly recommend due to being able to send out SMS. I have it set up where a client can request a callback. they put their phone number in the field, and when they click submit, it sends it over to a Twilio studio flow and that flow takes care of the rest. Simple. I wanted to style it even further so I reached out to them through support. They were very helpful and within an hour they had my site looking fresh. I will 100% use this plugin for all my future builds.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Nice!!!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tankcoder\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/539483bb1bf4cc96fb26ff15864f5384?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/539483bb1bf4cc96fb26ff15864f5384?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tankcoder\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">tankcoder<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 18, 2019<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Works fine and fast to configure.
