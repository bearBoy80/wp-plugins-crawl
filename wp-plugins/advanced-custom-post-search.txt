Not only this but you can also integrate a search form into any post, page or WordPress template using our simple shortcodes.<\/p>\n<p>Featuring unlimited, fully-customisable forms from which you can quickly search (by taxonomy term[s]) and display your custom post type results.<\/p>\n<p>ACPS harnesses WordPress\u2019 own tax queries to provide flexible results pages that address the lack of built-in taxonomy &amp; custom post type search options.<\/p>\n<p>Additional to this, we have also integrated theme functionality for developers who feel comfortable with adding their own folders and files.

Either copy the file(s) into the \u2018\/wp-content\/[theme_directory]\/acps\/templates\u2019 or \u2018\/wp-content\/[theme_directory]\/\u2018 directory to override the default templates.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>My results pages aren\u2019t listing any results<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The results pages work off of the standard WP_Query loop and therefore list any options based on the filters you selected.
