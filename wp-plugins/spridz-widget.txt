I came across Spridz and found it was easy to install, the real-time data that followed after someone submitted feedback is amazing. Easy to understand and the timeliness in receiving responses is just what I\u2019m after. Beyond my site, Spridz can also be used to request feedback via email, and our CRM. It\u2019s very affordable. Really worth trying it out. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/spridz-widget.0.3.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"customer-feedback":"customer feedback","customer-satisfaction":"customer satisfaction","net-promoter-score":"net promoter score","net-promoter-system":"net promoter system"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/spridz-widget.0.1.zip","0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/spridz-widget.0.2.zip","0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/spridz-widget.0.3.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/spridz-widget.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
