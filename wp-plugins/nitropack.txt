Onboarding was flawless. Ater my account was created on Nitropack's website, I got immediate results without having to modify a single setting. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">And by immediate results, I mean mind blowing results ! I initially thought there must have been an error, because it was hard to believe. I had been debugging and simplifying the bloody site for the last two days, lots of legacy stuff, tons of unused scripts on all pages, css selector names as long as the arm, a DOM to make you choke, you name it ...<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Trying is believing. I my case it was flawless. 98 on PageSpeed Insights for perfomances on mobile with simulated 4G throttled bandwidth, despite a bloody DOM size of 1300 on the product page, a render blocking super heavy search engine script that seemed impossible to defer or async without side effects, a parallax full screen image, an image gallery with carousel for pictures swiping on mobile, and a carousel for testimonials, woohoo !... I did not expect that. 100 for Desktop, of course. Great hosting and object caching also helps. But without that plugin, results were still poor, around 60 on perfs for mobile.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">You can safely ditch your Autoptimize, Fast Velocity, WP Rocket, Minify, ShortPixel, whatever ...

This plugin got it  to 93 in one day! It's not just the scores either, the difference when I browse my own site is phenomenal too. It took a bit of tweaking the settings to make it work well, and broke the site once (but turning it off and on fixed it) but for the enormous improvement it is well worth a little setup time. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Faltu plugin with faltu customer support!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/arafatislam\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e1deaf5c729e0ee26133a8e7caf9fe29?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e1deaf5c729e0ee26133a8e7caf9fe29?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/arafatislam\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">arafatislam<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 25, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">This is really bad system!
