They are providing instruction video about how to install add events. To add a new event you can easily set the event name, and images, the most interesting part is for google Maps you don't have to add any API just simply you can add your address and it will show in live. Also, you can add your payment method in just one click. This plugin will be for 100 rating but now I'm leaving only five. 100% recommended plugin events and also you can use it on your travel agency packages because it's also flexible for it. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ticket-spot.1.0.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ticket-spot\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2715657","caption":"Display a beautiful event list on your Wordpress site"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ticket-spot\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2715657","caption":"Increase your engagement by personalizing your email based on the values from your event or contact fields"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ticket-spot\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2715657","caption":"Engage with your attendees at every stage of your event"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ticket-spot\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2715657","caption":"Make it simple for your audience to find events"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ticket-spot\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2715657","caption":"Make your event list fit in perfectly with the theme of your wordpress site"},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ticket-spot\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=2715657","caption":"Automatically engage, promote and sync with your CRM so you can focus on putting on a great event"},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ticket-spot\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=2715657","caption":"Fully responsive event list to make your events look great from any device"}},"tags":{"calendar":"calendar","events":"events","schedule":"schedule","sms":"sms","tickets":"tickets"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ticket-spot.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ticket-spot.1.0.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ticket-spot.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ticket-spot\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2715657","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ticket-spot\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2715657"}}
