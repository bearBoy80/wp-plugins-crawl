It registers a new post type called &#8220;Pattern&#8221; that allows you to create and edit patterns in the same way you would create and edit posts.<\/p>\n<p>The pattern editor allows you to edit patterns separately as if they were pages. Patterns can also be saved directly to the active child theme which can enable a really powerful design system for theme developers once in place.<\/p>\n<p>More documentation coming soon.<\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>From your WordPress dashboard<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit &#8216;Plugins &gt; Add New&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Search for &#8216;Debug Toolkit&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Activate Debug Toolkit from your Plugins page.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I use this plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin adds a new post type called &#8220;Block Pattern&#8221; which can be accessed from Appearance &gt; Patterns.
