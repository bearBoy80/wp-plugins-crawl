By scheduling emails to be sent using cron jobs instead of sending them immediately, you can reduce server load and ensure that emails are sent in a timely and efficient manner, especially when sending bulk emails. This helps prevent delays and performance issues, leading to an overall improvement in website performance.<\/p>\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Email log: The plugin provides a log of all processed emails, making it easy to keep track of sent emails and troubleshoot any issues.<\/li>\n<li>Resend cancelled emails: If an email is cancelled or fails to send, this plugin provides an option to easily resend the email.<\/li>\n<li>Failed attempts: The plugin allows you to configure the number of attempts to send an email, which helps ensure that important emails are successfully delivered.<\/li>\n<li>Automatic record cleanup: The plugin offers the option to remove old records automatically after a certain time period or interval, ensuring that your email log stays up to date and doesn&#8217;t become cluttered with outdated information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Requirements<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 6.0 or newer.<\/li>\n<li>PHP version 7.4 or newer.

A cron job is a scheduled task that automatically runs at specified intervals. Here&#8217;s how you can set up a cron job:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log in to your web server control panel, such as cPanel or Plesk.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Find the option to manage cron jobs and select it.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In the &#8220;Add New Cron Job&#8221; section, specify the frequency at which you want the cron job to run, for example, every hour or every day.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In the &#8220;Command&#8221; field, enter the following command:<\/p>\n<pre><code>wget -q -O - https:\/\/[DOMAIN]\/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Make sure to replace [DOMAIN] with the URL of your WordPress website.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the cron job.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Add the following code to your wp-config.php file:<\/p>\n<pre><code>define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once the cron job is set up, the plugin will use it to send emails asynchronously.<\/p>\n<h4>Suggestions\/Feature Request<\/h4>\n<p>We value your feedback and ideas.
