If I come up with an idea to recover my costs, I&#8217;ll make it free for everyone (contact me if you have an idea).<\/p>\n<p>You do have to sign up at to get a key : <a href=\"https:\/\/whmcs.wpdone.com.au\/cart.php?gid=3\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">sign up here <\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a little <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wpdone.com.au\/speed-wordpress-website-content-accelerator\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">write up about the plugin<\/a><\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>install the plugin<\/li>\n<li>activate the plugin<\/li>\n<li>sign up here for free https:\/\/whmcs.wpdone.com.au\/cart.php?gid=3<\/li>\n<li>then you need to read your email, and enter your key into the plugin settings<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Installation Instructions<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>install the plugin<\/li>\n<li>activate the plugin<\/li>\n<li>sign up here for free https:\/\/whmcs.wpdone.com.au\/cart.php?gid=3<\/li>\n<li>then you need to read your email, and enter your key into the plugin settings<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>how does http\/2 help<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>http 1.1 loads 1 web file at a time. A standard WordPress page has about 80 files to load. http\/2 loads all the files as once. On average http\/2 saves 90%-95% loading the files on a page.<\/p>\n<p>The files are the images, js and css on a page.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How come it can enable http\/2 on a http page, even when my hosting company doesn&#8217;t have http\/2<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>I am glad you asked.<br \/>\nGenerally you need https to enable http\/2. And your hosting company has to upgrade their server to http\/2.<br \/>\nThis plugin changes the URL for web files\/assets on page to the CDN, and the URL has https, and the CDN has http\/2.<br \/>\nSo we&#8217;re able to bypass your hosting for the assets\/files on your web page, loading them from the CDN with http\/2.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>will it effect my SEO ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unlinkely that this plugin will effect your SEO either positively or negatively<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>how many locations does the CDN have ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>16 globally dispersed. We use bunnycdn currently.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>where is my data stored ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>wpdone keeps in in RAM copy of any hot objects, this saves load and transfer on yours hosting and ours.<\/p>\n<p>plus bunnycdn keeps the main copy.<\/p>\n<p>during a cached hit only bunnycdn is involved.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>is it better than xyz CDN ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>yes. but only in terms of ease and cost. most other CDNs need lots of settings and payment, this one doesn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>what if I already have caching and speedup plugins ?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>then is is unlikely to give you much raw speedup. This plugin is aimed at those with less skills or time or budget to invest in other solutions.<\/p>\n<p>it will still however help with a geo dispersed audience, or an audience far from the hosting server.<\/p>\n<p>it will also help if your site is image heavy, or has loads of css\/js files.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>faq added<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wpdone-website-content-accelerator\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1647481\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wpdone-website-content-accelerator\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1647481\" alt=\"&lt;p&gt;the simple settings screen.
