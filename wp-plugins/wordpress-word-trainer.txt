He has trouble connecting an image, let it be a picture or something he sees with his eyes, to words. He told me he started using the computer and Word to learn him to type. We\u2019re talking about baby steps here: a single picture connecting to a single word. He asked me to basically make a system which allowed him input words and pictures, and his grandson to playfully learn to connect them.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not looking for a word-teaching system, then this is not the plugin for you. Don\u2019t despair however! I\u2019ve got another great plugin ready and I\u2019ll definitely be making more in the future.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the unzipped archive to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Download a WPWT-compatible theme in the <code>\/wp-content\/themes\/<\/code> directory.
