This plugin does just that, allowing you to choose to redirect people to a different page, and even overwrite search results, on a granular, per-post basis.<\/p>\n<p>This is useful, for example, if you have Staff as your custom post type, for example, but don&#8217;t want anyone visiting the single of that staff and instead want them going to a staff overview page.<\/p>\n<p>Three options:<br \/>\n1. Checking &#8220;Prevent&#8221; next to a custom post type will not allow any single views of that type, and will redirect viewers to another page of your site.<br \/>\n2. Selecting the redirect page will redirect viewers of that single to this page &#8211; by default they will be redirected home.<br \/>\n3. Selecting a search overwrite page will replace that custom post type&#8217;s results on the search page with your desired page; it will overwrite the permalink and the excerpt.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload CPTLockdown.php or the &#8216;CPTLockdown&#8217; directory to your  &#8216;\/wp-content\/plugins\/&#8217; directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the Custom Post Down Lockdown plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; page in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Navigate to &#8220;Tools&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;CPTLockdown&#8221; in your WordPress admin backend to use.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a custom redirect URL if you wanted to redirect somewhere other than a WP page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Vou por ai a procurar rir pra n?o chorar.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Security notice<\/h4>\n<p>Neither Yonatan Reinberg nor Social Ink are responsible for any security, access or other problems encountered with the use of this plugin.
