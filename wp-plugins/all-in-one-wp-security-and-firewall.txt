This defect meant that a site administrator had the potential, between releases 5.1.9 to 5.2.0 (which purges the existing data), to know what site users&#8217; passwords are. This information has limited value (an admin can already reset anyone&#8217;s password) except insofar as the passwords may be re-used by users on other sites. In that &#8220;hostile admin&#8221; scenario, your site has other problems (since the hostile admin has a whole raft of equivalent ways of causing mischief to users, especially if not on multisite where a site admin is potentially not a super admin and may not be able to install or configure plugins). This changelog has been expanded in response to incorrect reports which suggested a wider problem (for example, they did not mention that the attacker needs to already be logged in as an admin to read the log, or that upgrading to 5.2.0 deletes the affected data).<\/li>\n<li>SECURITY: Set tighter restrictions on what subsite admins can do in a multisite.<\/li>\n<li>FIX: After editing a file reset permissions back to the original permissions<\/li>\n<li>FIX: Corrected some broken links in the plugin<\/li>\n<li>FIX: Fatal error: cannot declare class<\/li>\n<li>FIX: Normalise all arguments in the stacktrace<\/li>\n<li>FIX: Wrong login entries added to login activity table on multisite when user logs into subsite they don&#8217;t belong to.<\/li>\n<li>FIX: Too many redirects error for forced logout users solved<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: For Cronjob, WP CLI and AIOS_DISABLE_EXTERNAL_IP_ADDR defined constant do not use external services for user IP addresses.

security plugins to lock down sites, leading to serious problems. This is my first time using AIOWP Security and I must say I'm impressed. It does the job of all the other plugins combined with a much smaller footprint. Will be using this on all my sites going forward.
