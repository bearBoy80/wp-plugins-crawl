Before Flattr, the only reasonable way to donate has been to use Paypal or other systems to send money to people. The threshold for this is quite high. People would just ignore sending donations if it wasn&#8217;t for a really important cause. Sending just a small sum has always been a pain in the ass. Who would ever even login to a payment system just to donate \u20ac0.01? And \u20ac10 was just too high for just one blog entry we liked&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Flattr solves this issue. When you&#8217;re registered to flattr, you pay a small monthly fee. You set the amount yourself. In the end of the month, that fee is divided between all the things you flattered. You&#8217;re always logged in to the account. That means that giving someone some flattr-love is just a button away. And you should! Clicking one more button doesn&#8217;t add to your fee. It just divides the fee between more people! Flattr tries to encourage people to share. Not only pieces of content, but also some money to support the people who created them. With love!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Flattr requires an account at flattr.com!<\/strong><\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the folder &#8216;flattr&#8217; to your server in the folder &#8216;\/wp-content\/plugins\/&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Go to the WordPress control panel and find the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; section<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin &#8216;Flattr&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Select your default category (which usually would be &#8216;text&#8217; if you have a normal blog), select your default language and type in your Flattr username<\/li>\n<li>When writing or editing a blog post you have the ability to select category and language for this specific blog post.<\/li>\n<li>Live long and prosper. \ud83d\ude42<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>How do I use the shortcode?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The shortcode is [flattr url=&#8221;http:\/\/example.com\/&#8221;].
