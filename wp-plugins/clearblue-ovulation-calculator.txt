This ovulation calculator tool estimates the days on which a woman is most likely to ovulate.<br \/>\nCurrently, our tool only works for WordPress, but this plugin will be available on other platforms shortly.<\/p>\n<h4>What is an ovulation calculator?<\/h4>\n<p>An ovulation calculator estimates how likely a woman is to release an egg on a particular day in her menstrual cycle.<\/p>\n<h4>How does the ovulation calculator work?<\/h4>\n<p>The ovulation calculator takes the date the last period started and the average cycle length to estimate when a woman is most likely to ovulate. Results are based on information provided and on data from the following publication: Sarah Johnson, et al. Current Medical Research and Opinion (2018) DOI:10.1080\/03007995.2018.1475348<\/p>\n<h4>How to use the ovulation calculator?<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>The user enters the first day of the last menstrual period on the calendar.<\/li>\n<li>The user enters the average cycle length from the drop down list.<\/li>\n<li>The user clicks &#8216;calculate&#8217;.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>How will results be displayed and what do they mean?<\/h4>\n<p>Once the data is entered and \u2018calculate\u2019 clicked, a calendar will be displayed showing the days on which ovulation is likely marked in purple together with a percentage.  This is a percentage chance of ovulation on that day based on the inputted data.<\/p>\n<h4>Can I rely on an ovulation calculator?<\/h4>\n<p>An ovulation calculator estimates the potential ovulation days by taking the average cycle length and the date of the last period &#8211; basically the calendar method. It should be used for informational purposes only.<br \/>\nDetecting personal fertility hormones by using ovulation tests is a more accurate method to identify fertile days.<br \/>\nOvulation tests are 2x more accurate than calendar method [1].<\/p>\n<p>[1]: Study of 101 women in the UK comparing a simple calendar method to likelihood of conducting a test on LH surge day (2011).<\/p>\n<h4>How is an ovulation calculator different to a fertility calendar?<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>An ovulation calculator estimates the likelihood of ovulation happening on a particular day.<\/li>\n<li>A fertility calendar indicates the days when sex is likely to result in conception.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Credits<\/h3>\n<p>This tool is provided by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearblue.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Clearblue<\/a>.<\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>Installation from within WordPress<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Search for <strong>Clearblue\u00ae Ovulation Calculator<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Install and activate the Clearblue\u00ae Ovulation Calculator plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Manual installation<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>clearblue-ovulation-calculator<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory.<\/li>\n<li>Visit <strong>Plugins<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the Clearblue\u00ae Ovulation Calculator plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>After activation<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit <strong>Tools &gt; Ovulation Calculator<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Configure the tool according to your needs.<\/li>\n<li>See below on how to display the tool on your website.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Usage : As a shortcode<\/h4>\n<p>Add the shortcode <strong>[clearblue-ovulation-calculator]<\/strong> within the content of any of your pages\/posts.<\/p>\n<h4>Usage : As a widget<\/h4>\n<p>Visit <strong>Appearance &gt; Widgets<\/strong> and drag and drop the Ovulation Calculator widget in the desired widget area.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix translation integration<\/li>\n<li>Fix encoding<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add translations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix ovulation calculation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Stable version of the plugin<\/li>\n<li>English only<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/clearblue-ovulation-calculator\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2389771\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/clearblue-ovulation-calculator\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2389771\" alt=\"Example of display in front-office.\"><\/a><p>Example of display in front-office.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/clearblue-ovulation-calculator\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2389771\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/clearblue-ovulation-calculator\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2389771\" alt=\"Example of shortcode in a back-office page.\"><\/a><p>Example of shortcode in a back-office page.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/clearblue-ovulation-calculator\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2389771\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/clearblue-ovulation-calculator\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2389771\" alt=\"You can customize the display of the tool.\"><\/a><p>You can customize the display of the tool.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Good plugin<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"4 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"4\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/karlmrx75\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/61dff8bce87f83a468d8a6ce588fd681?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/61dff8bce87f83a468d8a6ce588fd681?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/karlmrx75\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">karlmrx75<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 5, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This ovulation calculator plug in was quite easy to install.
