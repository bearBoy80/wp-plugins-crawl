Only existing sites with social media likes and shares need HTTPS Social Migration Pro.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do I need an SSL Certificate installed on my site?<\/strong><br \/>\nYes, you will need to purchase an SSL Certificate from a certification authority before HTTPS Social Migration will work on your site. The premium version of this plug in comes with a detailed explanation, tips and a discount coupon for an SSL Certificate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What problems may occur when I migrate my site to HTTPS?<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen you migrate a site to HTTPS all of your page names will change to start with HTTPS instead of HTTP. This will cause all of the accumulated social media likes and shares on your site to display zero likes and shares. Visitors to your site will think your pages are unpopular, your search engine ranking will suffer because search engines take social credibility into account and your new likes and shares won&#8217;t add onto the likes and shares you already accumulated.<\/p>\n<p>Some plugins that specifically refer to HTTP assets on your site may also stop working or cause your pages to load with a security warning.<\/p>\n<p>In these cases, you should consider upgrading to the Premium version (HTTPS Social Migration Pro).<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<p>Release Date: February 25st, 2016<\/p>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Worked great<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/andrewmccauley\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/a5ce51d657059d846c0a83f26c5b49d0?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/a5ce51d657059d846c0a83f26c5b49d0?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/andrewmccauley\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Andrew McCauley <small>(andrewmccauley)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 8, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I used this plugin to keep the Facebook comments on my site when moving to https.
