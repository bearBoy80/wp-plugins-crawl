You see<br \/>\neverything is fine, so you hit save. As soon as the page is reloaded, you find out that your post<br \/>\nhas been truncated at a point that seems to be quite random. Well, that&#8217;s not random.<br \/>\nThe breaking point is the position of the first 4-bytes-long UTF-8 character.<br \/>\nAnything from that one up to the end of the post is irremediably lost forever.<\/p>\n<p>You definitely need to install this plugin if you write 4-bytes-long UTF-8 characters.<br \/>\nHow do you know that? Many Chinese characters, musical and mathematical symbols and Emoji icons<br \/>\nare 4-bytes-long. But you can always <a href=\"http:\/\/shapecatcher.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">try to draw something<\/a> and check for yourself.<br \/>\nIf you get a Unicode hexadecimal value with more than four digits after 0x then it is a 4-bytes-long UTF-8 character.<br \/>\nFor example, a <a href=\"http:\/\/shapecatcher.com\/unicode\/info\/119070\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">G-clef<\/a> is one because 0x1D11E has 5 digits after 0x.<br \/>\n1. This plugin is a WordPress &#8220;drop in&#8221;. Drop-ins are advanced plugins in the wp-content<br \/>\ndirectory that replace WordPress functionality when present.<br \/>\n1. This plugin is completely automatic. You are not supposed to do anything special<br \/>\nto make it work after activating it.<\/p>\n<h4>Interesting Links<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2010\/05\/18\/the-beauty-of-typography-writing-systems-and-calligraphy-of-the-world\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Beauty of Writing Systems<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/rishida.net\/docs\/unicode-tutorial\/part1\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Complexity of Writing Systems<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/oli-studholme\/2013-october-8\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">What is UTF-8?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>full-utf-8<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"<p>None.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>2.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Refreshed main code from WP 4.0.<\/li>\n<li>Added some images.<\/li>\n<li>Improved the description.<\/li>\n<li>Added banner and icon.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added complete support for data written to and read from the database.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed the unescape method so that it works on large strings as well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a small bug in a path that made 1.0.0 unusable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First version.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/full-utf-8\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1567101\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/full-utf-8\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1567101\" alt=\"Copy and paste some text into a new post (it works also if you type yourself in the editor.)\n&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/japanese.stackexchange.com\/a\/6873&quot;&gt;Example&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;\nEverything looks fine, so you save.\"><\/a><p>Copy and paste some text into a new post (it works also if you type yourself in the editor.)\n<a href=\"http:\/\/japanese.stackexchange.com\/a\/6873\">Example<\/a><br \/>\nEverything looks fine, so you save.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/full-utf-8\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1567101\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/full-utf-8\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1567101\" alt=\"Default WordPress: Oops!
