Unauthorized users will be redirected via a 301 redirect to your site&#8217;s homepage or a URL that you specify in the settings.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin is useful if you want to allow signups for your site but only want users with a certain capability (e.g. edit_others_pages for editor and administrator) to be able to access the admin area. This helps to ensure that malicious users can&#8217;t access something that you didn&#8217;t intend for them to access.<\/p>\n<p>You are also given the option to redirect the WordPress login and signup pages to your own custom pages. Redirecting those pages in addition to the admin can also help secure your site from someone trying to attack those URLs.<\/p>\n<p>Hidden WP Admin is brought to you by the fine folks at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wpbeaverbuilder.com\/?utm_source=external&amp;utm_medium=wp-repo&amp;utm_campaign=hidden-admin-description\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Beaver Builder<\/a>.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Install Hidden WP Admin either via the WordPress plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server at wp-content\/plugins.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>After activating Hidden WP Admin, navigate to the settings page at Settings &gt; Hidden WP Admin.

The settings page will be located in the Network Admin if you have Multisite enabled.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Do I need a custom login or signup page to hide those?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin assumes that you still want users to signup and login at your site, just not access the admin.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Help! I locked myself out of my site.<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is possible to lock yourself out of your site if you set the login page to redirect to a custom login page that doesn&#8217;t have a login form. If that happens, you will need to FTP into your site and manually delete the plugin.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>Version 1.1<\/h4>\n<p>Initial release.= Version 1.2 =<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug that broke logging out in some cases. <\/li>\n<li>Added update message to settings page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/hidden-wp-admin\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=929334\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/hidden-wp-admin\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=929334\" alt=\"The plugin settings page.\"><\/a><p>The plugin settings page.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great Job<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/getshuvo\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8999396d830c87a229cd7c5a3c0d45dc?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8999396d830c87a229cd7c5a3c0d45dc?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/getshuvo\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Shuvasish Sikder <small>(getshuvo)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>I liked it, Indeed!\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/hidden-wp-admin.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/hidden-wp-admin\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=929334","caption":"The plugin settings page."}},"tags":{"hide":"hide","lockdown":"lockdown","login":"login","secure":"secure","wp-login":"wp login"},"versions":{"1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/hidden-wp-admin.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/hidden-wp-admin.1.2.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/hidden-wp-admin\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=929405","high":false}}
