You can schedule<br \/>\na post, but you can&#8217;t schedule a widget&#8230;  But, not only does this widget allow itself to be scheduled both to turn on and off<br \/>\nat specific dates, you can have multiple scheduled items within a single element.  That is, you can set a a hyper-linked image to<br \/>\nshow from June 13th to July 2nd, and then have another element from July 3rd to August 8th.  Or, you can change the display method,<br \/>\nand overlap them.  All items in the range will show.  Or, select a random item within the specified date range (which could be<br \/>\nused for, say, an ad-rotator type application).  If you have any date-sensitive information, and don&#8217;t want to have to babysit your<br \/>\ndata, this will be useful.  Simply configure an element, set items with date ranges, and forget about the rest.<\/p>\n<p>Shows a small input button to edit your content while you are logged in.
