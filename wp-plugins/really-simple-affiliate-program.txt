That's probably the reason why the use of this plugin is somewhat limited.\nNonetheless, if you don't need this affiliate area, and just want to track sales and submissions of referral partners on a GF, this is it.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/really-simple-affiliate-program.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/really-simple-affiliate-program\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2047630","caption":""}},"tags":{"affiliate":"affiliate","program":"program","referral":"referral"},"versions":{"1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/really-simple-affiliate-program.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/really-simple-affiliate-program.1.3.zip","2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/really-simple-affiliate-program.2.0.zip","2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/really-simple-affiliate-program.2.1.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/really-simple-affiliate-program\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2047630","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/really-simple-affiliate-program\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2047630"}}
