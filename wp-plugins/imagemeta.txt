Each image is grouped by WordPress-generated sizes with detailed information about how\/if the image is attached or embedded. For orphaned images (not attached or embedded to any post or page), users may click a button to delete all iterations of this image to keep the uploads folder tidy and compact.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Simple, Straight-Forward Meta Updates<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The uploads directory (and subdirectories) is presented in a paginated table, sortable by image title or upload date.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update Title, Caption, Description or Alt values independently, or&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Update one, and copy across to the other fields.<\/li>\n<li>Updates are performed on-the-fly and saved instantly, so no lengthy reloads are necessary.<\/li>\n<li>A quick reference thumbnail is presented in-line to popup individual images for review.<\/li>\n<li>An edit link is provided beside each image to fine-tune editing, using traditional WordPress administration or ERA404&#8217;s CropRefine WordPress Plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Missing images are highlighted and an additional delete button is provided for safe\/quick file grooming.<\/li>\n<li>Quick-edit dropdowns are provided to open\/edit posts where images are attached or embedded into the post content.<\/li>\n<li>Delete button appears by orphaned or unused images not attached or embedded in any posts or pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>ImageMeta now performs your routine house-keeping for you<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Images Not on Disk:<\/strong> Individual &#8220;Delete&#8221; buttons are shown by missing images (JPEG, GIF, PNG) that don&#8217;t have corresponding files in the uploads directory. Upon clicking &#8220;Delete,&#8221; the obsolete\/old records will be removed from the WordPress database. Additionally, ImageMeta details a count of all missing images at the top of each page. For your convenience, you may click this link to delete all missing image records on the page, keeping your database compact and tidy.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Images Not Used in Posts or Pages:<\/strong> An additional delete link is shown to the right, beside the post counts, for images that are neither attached to a post\/page (e.g.: featured image) nor embedded in any post\/page content. Users who are vigilant about conserving disk use will appreciate this feature, for clearing out images (and their associated WordPress-generated sizes\/iterations) from their uploads directory.
