Be it news or technical article sometimes specifying sources is required and DX Sources provides with a tool just after your post editor where you can add dynamically new items without refreshing the page.<\/p>\n<p>The list of sources will be displayed under your article&#8217;s content with numerical representation before the name like [0], [1] e.t.c. Those numbers can be used for linking any text in your article to the source requried by adding link with url <code>#dxs-&lt;the source number&gt;<\/code>. For example the 4th source would be linked with <code>#dxs-4<\/code> and so on.<\/p>\n<h3>For theme developers:<\/h3>\n<p>The plugin doesn&#8217;t include any stylings or scripts to the front-end (theme), so no extra requests. There is also no inline or injected CSS to worry about overwriting. All the stylings are up to you. The markup uses <code>&lt;ul&gt;<\/code>, <code>strong<\/code> and <code>em<\/code>, so by default it should be styled properly. Still if you need anything more every single element has clean class names you can use. You can also use the unique incremented IDs for specific target if required.<\/p>\n","faq":"<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/dx-sources<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Access the plugin through the single post view.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.0 &#8211; 4\/14\/2016<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version of DX Sources<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.0 &#8211; 6\/16\/2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Second major version of DX Sources<\/li>\n<li>Added compilancy for Custom Post Types<\/li>\n<li>Added option to disable the numbers in front of each source<\/li>\n<li>Refactored the code<\/li>\n<li>Bugfixes in the post edit screen<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.1 &#8211; 6\/10\/2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugfix: Fixed an issue with a boolean variable being treated as an array in some cases, which resulted in warnings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dx-sources\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1396172\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dx-sources\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1396172\" alt=\"Example view for the plugin with basic default WordPress theme installed.
