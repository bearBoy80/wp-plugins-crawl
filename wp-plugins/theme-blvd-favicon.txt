Here you can configure a standard favicon along with bookmark icons for all portable Apple devices. All settings are completely optional.<\/p>\n<p>In WordPress 4.3, default favicon support was added to WordPress within the customizer. However, this plugin can still be useful if you&#8217;re looking to expand support of your favicon to touch device icons. In the future, I hope to re-write this plugin to work with, and expand on, the default WordPress favicon system.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: For this plugin to do anything, you must have a theme with Theme Blvd framework v2.1+ activated.<\/strong><\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>theme-blvd-favicon<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Go to <em>Appearance &gt; Theme Options &gt; Configuration<\/em> to use.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.2 &#8211; 09\/10\/2015<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Code cleanup and very minor security fixes.<\/li>\n<li>Added GlotPress compatibility.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1 &#8211; 07\/30\/2013<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added compatibility for Theme Blvd Framework v2.3+.<\/li>\n<li>Added <code>themeblvd_favicon_options<\/code> filter to favicon options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0 &#8211; 08\/31\/2012<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the first release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/theme-blvd-favicon\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1538885\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/theme-blvd-favicon\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1538885\" alt=\"Options added to your current theme at &lt;em&gt;Appearance &gt; Theme Options &gt; Configuration&lt;\/em&gt;.\"><\/a><p>Options added to your current theme at <em>Appearance &gt; Theme Options &gt; Configuration<\/em>.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/theme-blvd-favicon.1.0.2.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/theme-blvd-favicon\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1538885","caption":"Options added to your current theme at <em>Appearance &gt; Theme Options &gt; Configuration<\/em>."}},"tags":{"bobich":"Bobich","favicon":"favicon","jason-bobich":"Jason Bobich","theme-blvd":"Theme Blvd","themeblvd":"themeblvd"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/theme-blvd-favicon.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/theme-blvd-favicon.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/theme-blvd-favicon.1.0.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/theme-blvd-favicon.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/theme-blvd-favicon\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=593186","high":false}}
