This doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t use them; only, they won&#8217;t show them in their search results.<\/li>\n<li>It directs search engines from the comment pages back to the post storing those comments.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Compatibility<\/h4>\n<p><strong>The SEO Framework supports:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Internationalization through WordPress.org.

This generator supports every page, post, archive, and custom post type. We built it to be referential and expansive by generating an ID-based graph. For example, if you refer to a Person once, their entity will be put right there, but if you refer to it again, it will use an ID-based reference. This keeps the output code neat and will not waste time generating an entity twice. You can filter it via <code>the_seo_framework_schema_graph_data<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Environment upgrade notes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WordPress 5.5 through 5.8 are no longer supported.

To this day, this plugin still keeps impressing me with how lightweight it is.\n\nYou literarily \"don't feel\" it's there but it does what it's suppose to do - helps you manipulate the meta data for your website and content both for SERPs and social media.\n\nThe transition process from the previous SEO plugin we used was more than smooth and the support was really on point with all the questions and doubts we have had in regards to the transition (lots of data) and what steps we were to take to ensure the functionality is kept (and even improved if you ask me)).\n\nFor all of those who know the basics of SEO but also for everybody else, this plugin is just perfect because it really doesn't contain any additional (redundant) flashy features that really don't and can't help with ranks and also doesn't interfere with content writing. Most importantly, it doesn't contain features you can't control or can't disable, which also makes setting up SEO preferences really simple and straightforward even for complete beginners.\n\nIn essence, ever since we switched from a different SEO plugin to TSF - we haven't looked back an inch.\n\nI really can't remember the last time I was so impressed with a plugin or its functionality and judging by reviews I'm not the only one, so congratulations on a job well done and keep doing your thing.\n\nDisclaimer: Though I'm a part of a different development team behind WP products, there is no business nor personal relationship between us \/ me and the team behind TSF, and this (re)view is entirely my own. A great product is simply a great product and deserves the credit where credit is due<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Recommendation!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/gabrielschropp\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/eaa14da563df84191a47e05f1abee199?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/eaa14da563df84191a47e05f1abee199?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/gabrielschropp\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">gabrielschropp<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 29, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">The SEO Framework has been in use on my sites for many years.
