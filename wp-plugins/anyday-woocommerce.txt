It is interest-free and without any unexpected expenses and unpleasant surprises.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin allows your customers to split their payments into 4 equal installments. The first installment is always paid at checkout and the remaining installments are paid on the last banking day of the following three months.<\/p>\n<p>Anyday is always completely free of interest and your customers pay no additional fees as long as their installments are paid on time. In short: Anyday is both fair and transparent.<\/p>\n<p>To sign up for Anyday customers go through a quick but thorough credit evaluation and upon being accepted they will be granted credit.
