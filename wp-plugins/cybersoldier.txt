[player_page] \ndo not work, \"player does not exist\" or the shortcode \nalways appears on the screen.\n\nYou cannot create battles on the front-end, \nyou can only create battles through the back-end, \nso you have to grant permissions for the \"cybersoldier\" role \nso that users can enter the administration desk, impractical,\n I don't like it.\n\nI strongly believe that you should develop a module that allows \nyou to create and edit battles from the front-end.\n\nFinally, it would be necessary to be able to record audios \nand do the battles with voice, it is the essence of rap ... \nIn this way it is a competition of \"poets\" or \"writers\".\n\nStill, the plugin is interesting to create a different page \nthat promotes culture.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div
