Posts that have not been updated for a long time may suffer from Content Decay, affecting their search engine rankings. Knowing when to update a post or page can help you maintain or even improve your rankings.<\/p>\n<p>The Content Update Tracker Plugin simplifies monitoring the age of your posts &amp; pages and helps you to make crucial decisions based on that.<\/p>\n<p>It automatically categorizes posts into four different categories:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>GREEN: Posts Updated in the last 3 Months<\/li>\n<li>YELLOW: Posts Updated in the last 3 to 6 Months<\/li>\n<li>ORANGE: Posts Updated in the last 6 to 12 Months<\/li>\n<li>RED: Posts that have NOT been updated for longer than 12 Months<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For each category, you can export data to .csv for analysis in tools like Google Sheets.<\/p>\n<p>After performing any update on a post or page in WordPress, the plugin automatically re-categorizes the post or page and puts it in the correct category (usually into the GREEN category because as soon as a post is updated, it is obviously completely fresh).<\/p>\n<p>The plugin also moves posts &amp; pages among categories over time completely automatically. So, for instance, after publishing an article, if you don&#8217;t update it for 3 months, you will find this post moving from the GREEN category into the YELLOW category.<\/p>\n<p>With this plugin, you&#8217;ll always know which posts\/pages are up-to-date and which need updating.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin folder to your <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory.<\/li>\n<li>Go to the <strong>Plugins<\/strong> page in your WordPress admin panel and activate the plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I use this plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>After activating the plugin, you will find a new item in the WP dashboard called &#8220;Content Update Tracker.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Click on it, and you will then see the Content Update Dashboard. You will see at one glance which posts were recently updated and which posts have not been updated for a long time.<\/p>\n<p>Generally speaking, it is good to start with updating posts in the RED category, as these posts have not been updated for an extended period of time.<\/p>\n<p>You can also export all the data by simply clicking on either &#8220;Export All,&#8221; &#8220;Export Green,&#8221; &#8220;Export Yellow,&#8221; or &#8220;Export Orange,&#8221; or &#8220;Export Red.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To export all the info, simply click on &#8220;Export All.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Please note that sometimes it makes sense to<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20uninstall%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow to uninstall the plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>To uninstall the plugin:<br \/>\n1.
