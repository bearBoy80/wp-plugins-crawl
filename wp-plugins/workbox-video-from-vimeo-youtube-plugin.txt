Regardless, this link breaks the SSL certificate on my site because of a \"Mixed Content\" error. I fixed this by simply removing the \"http:\" from the link so that it will dynamically switch from HTTP to HTTPS depending on the URL used to render my site. This may not be the most comprehensive solution, and it is still loading this resource externally when an internal reference might be smarter, but this was my quick fix:<br \/>\n<code>wp_enqueue_script(&#039;jquery&#039;, &#039;\/\/ajax.googleapis.com\/ajax\/libs\/jquery\/1.7.2\/jquery.min.js&#039;);<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Please fix this in the next release so that I can download your updates without breaking my site again!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks.<\/p>\n<p>P.S.
