For example: the &#8216;New Category&#8217; email notification cannot use any of the author or time shortcodes as WordPress only stores the category name, category slug and category description in the database by default. It&#8217;s also worth checking the spelling and underscores in any shortcodes as well as if they are wrapped in square brackets <code>[]<\/code>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='other%20emails%20from%20wordpress%20%2F%20other%20plugins%20are%20being%20messed%20up%21'>\nOther emails from WordPress \/ other plugins are being messed up!\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress, by default, sends all emails in Plain Text. If you&#8217;d like to include code or use the WYSIWYG editor as part of Better Notifications for WP in your emails, you can change this to HTML using the global setting in Better Notification for WordPress. This can be found under the &#8216;Notifications &gt; Settings&#8217; screen. Changing this global email format setting will affect how all emails are sent out from WordPress however, so you may experience formatting issues with emails sent out from other plugins if you change the email format setting in this way. If you do, change this setting to Plain Text. You can also set the email format on a per-notification basis when setting-up a new Notification. The caveat is that WordPress will only either allow setting the email format globally (for all emails) or individually for anything that&#8217;s non-transactional.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='custom%20post%20type%20%27x%27%20isn%27t%20showing%20in%20the%20list%20of%20available%20custom%20post%20types'>\nCustom Post Type &#8216;X&#8217; isn&#8217;t showing in the list of available custom post types\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is most likely because it&#8217;s <code>public<\/code> setting is set to <code>false<\/code>. Try changing this and see if it shows up in the list. If the custom post type has been created by a plugin and is set to private (such as <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/tablepress\/\" title=\"TablePress\" rel=\"ugc\">TablePress<\/a>), you&#8217;ll need to get in touch with the plugin author to see if they&#8217;ll consider changing it to public instead so that BNFW can send out notifications for it.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20translate%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I translate this plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, of course!

Please read the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/bnfw\/faq\/\" rel=\"ugc\">FAQ<\/a> for more information about this as there is a small caveat.<\/li>\n<li>New: Support for WordPress 4.3.<\/li>\n<li>New: Pending posts that are changed to Published now trigger the &#8216;New Post \/ Page Notification&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: Scheduled notifications now trigger two notifications, one for when they&#8217;re saved as Scheduled (&#8216;Post Scheduled&#8217; \/ &#8216;Page Scheduled&#8217;) and one for when they&#8217;re actually published (&#8216;New Post Published \/ New Page Published&#8217;).<\/li>\n<li>Improved: Swapped the green tick for a dashicons tick for a slightly more speedier, native-feeling plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: Reduced the flash of hidden elements when loading the New \/ Edit Notification screen.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: WordPress 4.3 doesn&#8217;t allow passwords to be automatically created for new users and will instead, send them to a password generator page. The <code>[password]<\/code> shortcode has been replaced with <code>[password_url]<\/code>. <code>[password]<\/code> should still work though so it won&#8217;t break your existing notifications.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Some output was being showed when WP_DEBUG was enabled.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Removed the &#8216;slug&#8217; field when enabled from Screen Options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.2 &#8211; 20th July 2015<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Replaced a deprecated function which might cause a warning to show when <code>WP_DEBUG<\/code> was enabled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.1 &#8211; 18th July 2015<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: The P2 theme wasn&#8217;t triggering new post or comment notifications.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Sometimes the shortcode help link at the bottom of the notification editor wouldn&#8217;t link to the help page properly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3 &#8211; 2nd July 2015<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New: Option to disable notifications going to the user that triggered them.<\/li>\n<li>New: Comment Reply Notification. This is a transactional notification that will only trigger when replying to the original comment (i.e. Up to 2-levels deep).<\/li>\n<li>New: New Shortcode: Update Author. Use <code>[post_update_author]<\/code> in any Post or Page notifications to see which user updated the post.<\/li>\n<li>New: Choose between sending the notification as plain text or HTML.<\/li>\n<li>New: A basic implementation of shortcode help has been added into the plugin. Click the link below the message body editor to see which shortcodes can be used for the currently selected notification.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: The &#8216;New User Registration&#8217; (For Admin &amp; User) and &#8216;Welcome Email&#8217; notifications now allow you to use all of the &#8216;User&#8217; shortcodes.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Formatting in emails sent from other plugins were being effected by BNFW.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Notifications for Categories, Terms and Tags weren&#8217;t getting triggered.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Notifications weren&#8217;t getting triggered when using the P2 theme (please see the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/bnfw\/faq\/\" rel=\"ugc\">FAQ<\/a> for more information about this).<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Additional Email fields were being shown for transactional notifications that couldn&#8217;t use them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2 &#8211; 19th May 2015<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New: WYSIWYG Editor for notifications!<\/li>\n<li>New: From Name, From Email, CC and BCC options are now available to use for each notification!<\/li>\n<li>New: &#8216;Send Me a Test Email&#8217; button. Save your notification first and then send yourself a test email! This will only go to you and not to any of the other users selected in the notification. Shortcodes will not be expanded but will be shown in place.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: The User Role \/ Users drop down box has been unified for simplicity.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Lost Password (For User) notifications were being sent in plain text.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Not all custom post types were showing when setting up a new notification.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Notifications for New Terms not generating notification emails.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Custom Taxonomies missing from columns in the All Notifications screen.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Added a space after lists of tags, categories, and terms.<\/li>\n<li>Thank you again for all of your support, feedback, and awesome reviews. You people make WordPress great!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.5.3 &#8211; 21st April 2015<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility with WordPress 4.2.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.5.2 &#8211; 15th April 2015<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Custom Post Type Pending Posts not being sent.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Post excerpt not outputting anything.<\/li>\n<li>Removed: <code>[closedpostboxes_page], [rich_editing], and [admin_color]<\/code> as was a bit defunct and causing issues.<\/li>\n<li>Changed: <code>[post_author]<\/code> now outputs the display name instead of the author ID.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: Clarity of custom post type and taxonomy labels.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.5.1 &#8211; 13th April 2015<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for Custom Post Type notifications not populating shortcodes.<\/li>\n<li>Fix for Custom Taxonomy terms not sending out notification emails.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.5 &#8211; 10th April 2015<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New Shortcode: [permalink].<\/li>\n<li>New Notifications: &#8216;Scheduled Posts&#8217; and &#8216;Scheduled Pages&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>New Shortcodes for the above Notifications: [post_scheduled_date] and [post_scheduled_date_gmt].<\/li>\n<li>New Notification: &#8216;New Page Published&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>New Notification: &#8216;Page &#8216;Updated&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>New Notification: &#8216;Page Pending Review&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>New Notification: &#8216;New Page &#8211; Comment&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: A few bugs reported via the forums and some others that i&#8217;ve found &#8211; thanks everyone!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1 &#8211; 16th March 2015<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of cool new stuff and more to come soon!<\/li>\n<li>Transactional notifications (notifications intended only for the end user) have been added as a new group in the notifications select box.<\/li>\n<li>New Notification: Post Pending Review (for all post types).<\/li>\n<li>New Notification: New User Registration (Transactional).<\/li>\n<li>New Notification: Password Reset (Transactional).<\/li>\n<li>New Notification: New User Welcome Email (Transactional).<\/li>\n<li>Added an option to enable or disable each notification.<\/li>\n<li>Better support for custom taxonomies and terms.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: A few PHP warnings were showing when using <code>WP_DEBUG<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: HTML tags being stripped from <code>[post_content]<\/code> and <code>[comment_content]<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Removed: Some WordPress Multisite shortcodes that didn&#8217;t work properly.
