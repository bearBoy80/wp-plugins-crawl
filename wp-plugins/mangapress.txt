Or they add a second navigation bar<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is because the navigation for the comics is built into the theme. Using a different theme or overriding the default theme&#8217;s template will allow you to use the options. (however, see <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jesgs\/mangapress\/issues\/17\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issue #17<\/a> for additional issues)<\/p>\n<p><em>Does Manga+Press work on WordPress Multi-site?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Yes, it does. However, a few steps must be taken to make Manga+Press&#8217; child-themes available to your network. See the question below on the steps to take to enable the child-themes on Multisite.<\/p>\n<p><em>The bundled themes aren&#8217;t available in WordPress Multi-site. What&#8217;s going on?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is because the plugin hasn&#8217;t been activated for the entire MS network. In order for the child-themes to be available, Manga+Press must be available to the entire network. This can be done by going to <strong>Network Admin &gt; Plugins<\/strong> and clicking the <em>Network Activate<\/em> link for Manga+Press. Once this is done, then both the parent- and child-themes need to made available to the network as well. This can be accomplished by going to <strong>Network Admin &gt; Themes<\/strong>, selecting the themes in question, choosing <strong>Bulk Actions &gt; Network Enable<\/strong>, and then clicking <strong>Apply<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><em>Is Manga+Press responsive?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Not by itself. However, Manga+Press doesn&#8217;t really output markup other than the comic navigation. Responsiveness depends on the theme that is being used. The themes bundled with Manga+Press \u2014 the TwentyEleven thru TwentyFourteen child-themes \u2014 all have some level of responsiveness that is dependent on their parent themes.<\/p>\n<p><em>Is Manga+Press compatible with Advanced Custom Fields<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Yes, it is! Manga+Press is simply a stripped down custom post-type with a custom Featured Image meta-box. Like any other post-type, you can add a new field group using ACF \u2014 however, you <em>will<\/em> have to configure your theme to display these custom fields.<\/p>\n<p><em>Is Manga+Press compatible with the WPML plugin?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I have never had the chance to test Manga+Press with the WPML plugin so I can&#8217;t really guarantee compatibility. Since Manga+Press works like a standard WordPress post, and WPML <em>is<\/em> compatible with custom post-types, this shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.<\/p>\n<p><em>Do you take feature requests?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I do take feature requests, but I also judge each request on the basis of how well the new feature fits into Manga+Press&#8217; current functionality and also how feasible the new feature is to implement into Manga+Press&#8217; core.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>3.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>3.0\n<ul>\n<li>Removed child themes<\/li>\n<li>Added sorting options for Comic Archive Page<\/li>\n<li>Added comic archive calendar template<\/li>\n<li>Added comic archive gallery template<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2.9.3\n<ul>\n<li>Spanish language updates to embedded themes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>2.9.2\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for Jetpack Publicize feature.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>2.9.1<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Corrects an issue where Comic posts were not getting assigned to a default Series taxonomy on save.<\/li>\n<li>Corrects Comic post 404 error\/Missing Comic post issue.<\/li>\n<li>Corrects appearance of comic navigation on Latest Comic page<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>2.9.0<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated navigation CSS<\/li>\n<li>Removed &#8220;Order By&#8221; Option.

I had no problem making it work with my template and I never encountered any weird glitches or errors with my content.\nI do have some minor nitpicks and wishes for future updates if the creator ever decides to continue his work. \n\n1) A \"random comic\" button in the navigation under the comic image would be nice. Perhaps even let us exclude certain categories\/series to give us more control.\n\n2) Better social media compatibility. All SM plugins I used seem to have troubles reading the image for me to share. Reddit seems to work, facebook works occasionally and twitter \/ thumblr don't find the img at all.\n\n3) More control and options for the archive subpage - perhaps let us display and order the categories manually; would be really useful when you have more than 1 category associated with a comic (I'm using css to hide classes to make this work at the moment)\n\n\nIn short; this plugin may lack some features of other more complex ones but it makes up for it for better easy-to-understand usability. A good plugin if your starting out with webcomics and you cant be bothered to invest too much time in programming a complex webcomic site. \n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.3.0.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mangapress\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2812309","caption":"screenshot-1.png"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mangapress\/trunk\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2812309","caption":"screenshot-2.jpg"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mangapress\/trunk\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=2812309","caption":"screenshot-3.jpg"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mangapress\/trunk\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=2812309","caption":"screenshot-4.jpg"}},"tags":{"online-comics":"online comics","webcomics":"webcomics"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.1.0.zip","2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.0.zip","2.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.0.1.zip","2.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.5.zip","2.5.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.5.1.zip","2.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.6.zip","2.6.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.6.1.zip","2.6.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.6.2.zip","2.6.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.6.3.zip","2.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.7.zip","2.7-beta-3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.7-beta-3.zip","2.7-rc1-1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.7-rc1-1.zip","2.7.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.7.1.zip","2.7.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.7.2.zip","2.7.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.7.3.zip","2.7.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.7.5.zip","2.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.8.zip","2.8.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.8.1.zip","2.8.1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.8.1.1.zip","2.8.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.8.2.zip","2.8.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.8.3.zip","2.8.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.8.4.zip","2.9.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.9.0.zip","2.9.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.9.1.zip","2.9.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.9.2.zip","2.9.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.2.9.3.zip","3.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.3.0.0.zip","3.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.3.0.1.zip","4.0.0-beta":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.4.0.0-beta.zip","4.0.0-beta.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.4.0.0-beta.2.zip","4.0.0-rc.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.4.0.0-rc.1.zip","4.0.0-rc.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.4.0.0-rc.2.zip","4.0.0-rc.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.4.0.0-rc.3.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mangapress.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.manga-press.com\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mangapress\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=996365","high":false}}
