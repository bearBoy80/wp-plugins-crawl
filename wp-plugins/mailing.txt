When you will create newsletters you will be able to target your audience by those groups. If you don&#8217;t need to separate subscribers, you could just skip it and add subscription forms to your pages.<\/p>\n<h3>CONFIGURING SUBSCRIPTION FORMS<\/h3>\n<p>Thanks to WordPress Block Editor, creating subscription forms is simple and does not require any coding. To add a form to a page just start creating a WordPress page like you normally would. Simply click <em>Pages<\/em> -&gt; <em>Add new<\/em>. This will launch the Block Editor.<\/p>\n<p>To add a form click <em>Add block<\/em> button (button with + sign in it). This will toggle the block inserter. In the block inserter find <em>Subscribe Form<\/em> under the section <em>Widgets<\/em> and click it. Signup form will appear in the editor. You can customize this form using visual editor and <em>Form Settings<\/em> block which will appear in the right column of your screen.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it. After you publish this page your visitors will be able to subscribe to your newsletters.<\/p>\n<h3>CREATING NEWSLETTERS<\/h3>\n<p>Sending newsletters to your subscribers is even easier than configuring subscription forms. Just go to <em>Mailing<\/em> -&gt; <em>Newsletters<\/em> in your dashboard and click <em>Add new<\/em> button.<\/p>\n<p>Write content of the email using Block Editor, specify email subject as a newsletter title, if you need to send a newsletter to a certain group of subscribers, choose this group in block <em>Targeting<\/em> in the right column of your screen.<\/p>\n<p>When your newsletter will be ready just click <em>Send<\/em> button in the top right corner of the screen.<\/p>\n","description":"<p>WordPress plugin for managing email subscriptions and sending newsletters.<\/p>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mailing.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"email":"email","mailing":"mailing","marketing":"marketing","newsletter":"newsletter"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mailing\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2743819","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mailing\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2743819"}}
