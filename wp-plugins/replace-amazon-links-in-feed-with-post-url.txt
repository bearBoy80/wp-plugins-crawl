Unfortunately, many people use RSS feeds to populate their emails to users. One solution was to simply remove the affiliate links from feeds, which works just fine. But I came up with a solution (out of need) that changed the affiliate link in a feed into a link to the post itself.<\/p>\n<p>Once on the live site, the affiliate link will work as normal, this plugin just facilitates an easier way for the end user to get the affiliate link.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>replace-amazon-links-kd.php<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it!
