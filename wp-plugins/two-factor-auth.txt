Users will have to enter an One Time Password when they log in.<\/p>\n<h4>Why You Need This<\/h4>\n<p>Users can have common or weak passwords that lets hackers\/bots brute-force your WordPress site and gain access to your files and place malware there.<br \/>\nJust like happend not that long ago: <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/04\/12\/hackers-point-large-botnet-at-wordpress-sites-to-steal-admin-passwords-and-gain-server-access\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Article on TechCrunch<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If all sites would have used this plugin, this would never happend.<br \/>\nIt doesn&#8217;t matter how weak your users passwords are, no one can gain access to your WordPress site<br \/>\nwithout already having access to the users mobile phone or email inbox (depending on how the user gets his OTP).<\/p>\n<h4>How Does It Work?<\/h4>\n<p>This plugin uses the industry standard algorithm <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TOTP<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/HMAC-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HOTP<\/a> for creating One Time Passwords.<br \/>\nA OTP is valid for a certain time and after that a new code has to be entered.<\/p>\n<p>You can now choose to use third party apps like <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/google-authenticator\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Authenticator<\/a> which is available for most mobile platforms. You can really use any<br \/>\nthird party app that supports TOTP\/HOTP that generates 6 digits OTP&#8217;s.<br \/>\nOr, as before, you can choose to get your One Time Passwords by email.<\/p>\n<p>Since you have to enter a secret code to third party apps, email is the default way of delivering One Time Passwords. Your<br \/>\nusers will have to activate delivery by third party apps themselves.<\/p>\n<h4>Easy To Use<\/h4>\n<p>Just install this plugin and you&#8217;re all set. There&#8217;s really nothing more to it.<br \/>\nIf you want to use a third party app, goto Two Factor Auth in the admin menu and activate it and set up your app.<br \/>\nGeneral settings can be found uner Settings -&gt; Two Factor Auth in admin menu. Settings for each individual user<br \/>\ncan be found at the root level of the admin menu, in Two Factor Auth.<br \/>\nA bit more work to get logged in, but a whole lot more secure!<\/p>\n<p>If you use WooCommerce or other plugins that make custom login forms, you will not be able to login through those anymore.<br \/>\nI will be adding a plugin that puts a One Time Password field to WooCommerce. If you use some other plugin that needs<br \/>\nsupport for this, let me know in the support forum.<\/p>\n<h4>TOTP or HOTP<\/h4>\n<p>Which algorithm you and your users choose doesn&#8217;t really matter. The time based TOTP is a bit more secure since a One Time<br \/>\nPassword is valid only for a certain amount of time. But this requires the server time to be in sync the clients time (if<br \/>\nthe OTP isn&#8217;t delivered by email). This is often hard to do with embedded clients and the event based HOTP is then a better choice.<br \/>\nIf you have a somewhat slow email server and have chosen email delivery, you might not get the TOTP in time.<\/p>\n<p>Conslusion: Choose which ever you want. TOTP is a little bit safer since OTP:s only are valid for a short period.<\/p>\n<p>Note that email delivery users always uses the site default algorithm, which you can set on the settings page. Third party<br \/>\napps users can choose which one they want.<\/p>\n<h4>Is this really Two Factor Auth?<\/h4>\n<p>Before version 3.0 this plugin had &#8216;kind of&#8217; two factor auth where the OTP was delivered to an email address.<br \/>\nSince version 3.0 you can have real two factor auth if you activate the Third Party Apps delivery type.<\/p>\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"http:\/\/oskarhane.com\/two-factor-auth-explained\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">what two factor auth means &gt;&gt;<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>See http:\/\/oskarhane.com\/plugin-two-factor-auth-for-wordpress\/ for more info.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Easy installation.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin requires PHP version 5.3 or higher and support for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/manual\/en\/mcrypt.installation.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PHP mcrypt<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <em>two-factor-auth.zip<\/em> through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search for &#8216;Two Factor Auth&#8217; in the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Click the &#8216;Install&#8217; button.
