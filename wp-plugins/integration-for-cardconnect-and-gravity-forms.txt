Search for &#8220;Gravity Forms CardConnect&#8221; in the &#8220;Add plugins&#8221; section, then click &#8220;Install Now&#8221;. Once it installs, you will see a link that says &#8220;Activate&#8221;. Click that link, and the link should update to &#8220;Active&#8221;. Alternatively, you can upload the directory directly to your plugins directory (typically \/wp-content\/plugins\/)<\/li>\n<li>Navigate to Forms &gt; Settings in the WordPress admin<\/li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;CardConnect&#8221; in the lefthand column of that page<\/li>\n<li>Enter your CardConnect Merchant ID number, username, password, and API URL. You will need to contact CardConnect&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/support.cardconnect.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support<\/a> to verify these details for your account.<\/li>\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve entered your CardConnect account details, create a form or edit an existing form&#8217;s settings. You&#8217;ll see a &#8220;CardConnect&#8221; tab in settings where you can create a &#8220;CardConnect Feed&#8221;. This allows you to send payment data collected by the form to CardConnect. If you&#8217;ve configured payment feeds for other PayPal add-ons before, the interface will be familiar. If not, see Gravity Forms&#8217; <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.gravityforms.com\/configuring-paypal-payments-pro-feeds\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">guide<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20with%20ninja%20forms%2C%20contact%20form%207%2C%20jetpack%2C%20etc.%3F'>\nDoes this work with Ninja Forms, Contact Form 7, Jetpack, etc.?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope. This is specifically an Add-On for Gravity Forms and will not function properly if installed and activated without it.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20version%20of%20gravity%20forms%20do%20i%20need%3F'>\nWhat version of Gravity Forms do I need?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must be running at least Gravity Forms 1.9.18.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20add-on%20to%20set%20up%20recurring%20transactions%20or%20subscriptions%3F'>\nCan I use this add-on to set up recurring transactions or subscriptions?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>With a workaround! The CardPointe gateway does not offer native support for recurring transactions, so the plugin itself cannot create a recurring transaction. However you can request a Profile ID. This Profile ID, as well as the other required data, are then available through the GF Export feature for all entries.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20add-on%20to%20authorize%20payments%20and%20capture%20them%20later%3F'>\nCan I use this add-on to authorize payments and capture them later?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! When you configure a CardConnect feed for your form, look for the &#8220;Capture payments immediately?&#8221; radio button, and select &#8220;No, authorize only&#8221;. Users who submit your form will not be charged until you capture their authorized payments using the CardPointe portal.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the capability to authorize payments without capturing them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the capability to request Profile ID from the CardPointe gateway.<\/li>\n<li>Store and export CardPointe gateway authorization and capture fields.<\/li>\n<li>Tested on WP 5.9<\/li>\n<li>Increased minimum PHP version to 7.0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug that caused some CardConnect testing domains to be incorrectly rejected as invalid (props @rscs).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug in the way some Gravity Forms input was translated to pricing data for CardConnect.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/integration-for-cardconnect-and-gravity-forms.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"crm":"crm","forms":"forms","integration":"integration"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/integration-for-cardconnect-and-gravity-forms.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/integration-for-cardconnect-and-gravity-forms.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/integration-for-cardconnect-and-gravity-forms.1.0.2.zip","1.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/integration-for-cardconnect-and-gravity-forms.1.1.0.zip","1.2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/integration-for-cardconnect-and-gravity-forms.1.2.0.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/integration-for-cardconnect-and-gravity-forms\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2264690","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/integration-for-cardconnect-and-gravity-forms\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2264690"}}
