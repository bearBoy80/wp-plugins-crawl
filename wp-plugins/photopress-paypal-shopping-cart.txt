Specifically designed for photographers who want to enable print ordering for large image catalogs, the plugin uses the title of the image as the product name &#8211; requiring no setup of a parallel e-commerce &#8220;product catalog&#8221; (like most other plugins require). This plugin relies on the WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart plugin to implement the shopping cart and accept payments via PayPal.<\/p>\n<h4>Features include<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Custom image taxonomy for storing purchase variations (e.g. print sizes and finishes)<\/li>\n<li>Set unique prices for each purchase variation<\/li>\n<li>Choose purchase variations by image or for all images on your website<\/li>\n<li>Widget for single Image\/attachment page<\/li>\n<li>Template functions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Premium Support<\/h4>\n<p>The PhotoPress team does not provide support for this plugin on the WordPress.org forums.

But it doesn't. Adding price variations to shortcode doesn't modify the price defined for Simple Paypal Shopping Cart Plugin; it keeps the price even when you add the image to shoping cart selecting a different price variation.<\/p>\n<p>There's two explanations for this issue. First, the implementation is poorly documented; the three lines dedicated to this in FAQ section could not be enough, which is developer's fault.<\/p>\n<p>Second, there's a bug and plugin doesn't work. But since the developer sells \"support plans\" and doesn't answer posts in the forum, there's no way to know nor to solve the issue unless you pay for support just in case it could work, which is also developer's fault.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, you'll waste your time trying to implement this plugin. I already wasted six hours for everybody and, following the instructions published here, it doesn't work.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/photopress-paypal-shopping-cart.1.8.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"e-commerce":"e-commerce","images":"images","photos":"photos","shopping-carts":"shopping carts","taxonomies":"taxonomies"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/photopress-paypal-shopping-cart.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/photopress-paypal-shopping-cart.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/photopress-paypal-shopping-cart.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/photopress-paypal-shopping-cart.1.3.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/photopress-paypal-shopping-cart.1.4.zip","1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/photopress-paypal-shopping-cart.1.5.zip","1.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/photopress-paypal-shopping-cart.1.6.zip","1.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/photopress-paypal-shopping-cart.1.7.zip","1.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/photopress-paypal-shopping-cart.1.8.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/photopress-paypal-shopping-cart.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.photopressdev.com","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/photopress-paypal-shopping-cart\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=858759","high":false}}
