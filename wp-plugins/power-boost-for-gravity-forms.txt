The 3 database queries are cached for a maximum of 6 hours instead of running every time the dashboard widget loads. Six hours can be changed with the a filter <code>gravityforms_dashboard_cache_duration<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>[Fixed] Bug fix when retrieving a partial entry in the HTML field merge tags feature. Explicitly convert floats to strings so they are not interpreted as integers.<\/li>\n<li>[Changed] Changes tested up to version number to 6.2.0.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Fixed] Adds support for PHP 7.2 by fixing syntax errors around commas after final function parameters.<\/li>\n<li>[Fixed] Bug fix when linking users to redirect-type confirmations after using the Replace Forms feature.<\/li>\n<li>[Fixed] No longer writes a form .json file when the plugin is activated if a form&#8217;s file already exists and does not need updating.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Fixed] Fixes a bug when loading a form JSON file on the Local JSON tab. Now explicity casts a form ID as an integer.<\/li>\n<li>[Changed] Changes tested up to version number to 6.1.1<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Changed] Stops minimizing form JSON files saved by the Local JSON feature<\/li>\n<li>[Added] Adds a filter <code>gravityforms_local_json_minimize<\/code> to enable minimized form JSON files to restore old behavior<\/li>\n<li>[Fixed] Adds documentation for merge tags in HTML fields: form must have page breaks<\/li>\n<li>[Fixed] Replace Forms feature now maintains form active status after replacing forms instead of leaving previously-active forms inactive<\/li>\n<li>[Changed] Applies the WordPress coding standard, adds more translateable strings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.4.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Fixed] Fixes a bug that broke Populate Anything Live Merge Tags<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.4.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Fixed] Fixes a bug when trying to replace merge tags for fields with multiple inputs<\/li>\n<li>[Changed] Adds an early exit if the form editor is detected before attempting to replace merge tags in HTML fields<\/li>\n<li>[Changed] Replaces merges tags in HTML fields at a later priority after Populate Anything Live Merge Tags runs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.4.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Added] Enables merge tags in HTML fields<\/li>\n<li>[Changed] Changes tested up to version number to 6.0.1<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.3.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Fixed] Resend Feeds now handles feeds that store feed names in a feedName property rather than feed_name or provide no feed name at all. Also, a nice name is provided for the Partial Entries add-on which does not use feed names. <\/li>\n<li>[Fixed] Resend Feeds now disables asynchronous feed processing so feeds are resent immediately after pressing the Resend button.<\/li>\n<li>[Fixed] Fixes a green checkmark not showing near &#8220;Feeds were resent successfully&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.3.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Fixed] Fixes a bug when creating form .json files during plugin activation. We need to check if Gravity Forms is running before trying to create the files since this feature operates without relying on Gravity Forms hooks that degrade nicely.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.3.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Added] Now creates .json file exports of each form during plugin activation.<\/li>\n<li>[Added] Form replacer now detects redirect-type confirmations and reminds users that these URLs might need to be updated after replacing forms.<\/li>\n<li>[Fixed] Fixes a bug in the Form replacer when providing an Edit Form link to users who just imported a single form.<\/li>\n<li>[Changed] Bumps tested up to version to 5.9.3<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Fixed] Now reports failures while resending feeds.

Core Gravity Forms has caught up and fixed this bug.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Added] Adds a feature that puts form IDs near field labels while editing forms.<\/li>\n<li>[Changed] Changes the plugin icon and banner so this plugin looks better on WordPress.org. The icon had an odd seam between two colors, and the banner was ugly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Fixed] Fixes a bug, do nothing if Gravity Forms is not running by always checking if it is active.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Added] Adds a feature called Local JSON that maintains .json file exports of each form when forms are edited and allows forms to be updated by loading their .json files. Local JSON works similarly to ACF and enables forms to be put into version control with themes or plugins.<\/li>\n<li>[Removed] Removes a feature that highlights forms in the admin bar if they are rendered on the current page. This feature was broken by WordPress 5.4&#8217;s introduction of the <code>wp_body_open<\/code> hook. Details <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/csalzano\/power-boost-for-gravity-forms\/issues\/3\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Added] Adds a feature that puts field IDs near labels when editing entries in the dashboard. This behavior matches an existing feature that puts field IDs near labels when viewing entires in the dashboard.<\/li>\n<li>[Fixed] Bug fix, prevents forms that do not exist from being updated when using the Replace Forms feature on the Import\/Export page. Only forms that already exist will be affected by Replace Forms regardless of how many forms are in the .json file that was uploaded.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Added] Adds a feature that allows the export .json files to update existing forms. A new tab is added to the Import\/Export page titled, &#8220;Replace Forms.&#8221; When form export files are uploaded to this page, existing forms are updated. This differs from the built-in &#8220;Import Forms&#8221; feature that always inserts forms and creates duplicates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Added] Adds a few CSS rules to better display long form names in the form switcher dropdown. Gravity Forms 2.5 changes the dashboard to conceal form names after the first 21 characters in the dropdown used to choose a form.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Fixed] Fixes a bug for forms with no active feeds. Changes the message telling users the form has no active feeds to use less words.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Added] First version with this readme.txt<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/power-boost-for-gravity-forms\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2523452\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/power-boost-for-gravity-forms\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2523452\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Gravity Forms list of forms.
