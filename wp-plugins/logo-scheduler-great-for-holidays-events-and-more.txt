It is still possible that your theme does not use one of these container ID&#8217;s though. If that is the case, you will need to look at the code to see what the ID is for the div containing your logo and insert that ID in the Logo Container ID field.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20provide%20professional%20development%20support%20if%20i%20can%27t%20get%20it%20to%20work%3F'>\nDo you provide professional development support if I can&#8217;t get it to work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We sure do!
