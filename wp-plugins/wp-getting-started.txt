When they have completed a step, they are automatically taken back to the walkthrough on the Dashboard.<\/p>\n<p>WP Getting Started is fully compatible with multisite networks, to give new users an easier introduction to the WordPress admin interface, and is no more intrusive than the original Welcome Panel in WordPress (further explanations only show up when the user follows the links from WP Getting Started).<\/p>\n<p>This plugin is fully compatible with <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/live-theme-preview\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Live Theme Preview<\/a>, a drop-in replacement for WordPress&#8217; native Themes interface.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin only works with WordPress version 3.4 or later.<\/p>\n<p><em>This plugin is only freshly released, so use with care.
