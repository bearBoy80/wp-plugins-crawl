I installed it, and it's the <em>perfect<\/em> lightweight solution to my needs - it runs a timer at the bottom of a post as I work on it.\n\nI wish the plugin came with a few options, like clearing the counter, pausing (especially after a post has been published), or adding the time-count as a column on the Posts page, but I'm happy to manage reporting directly from SQL queries for the time being.\n\nThanks for solving my problem, Worktime Logger!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/post-worktime-logger.1.5.3.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/post-worktime-logger\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1514124","caption":"This is the meta box right to the post editor.
