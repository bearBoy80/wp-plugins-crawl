My wife, Lindsey, started <a href=\"https:\/\/thepostmansknock.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The Postman&#8217;s Knock<\/a> in 2013, and it has since grown to be the #1 online resource for learning calligraphy. Fast forward a few years to 2018, and we were stuck paying Mailchimp around $500 a month ($6,000 a year) to mail our list of 100,000 subscribers 3x per week. I projected our costs would rise to $8,500 by 2019, and $10,000 by 2020. In response to the rising costs, we developed Boldermail to meet our email marketing and automation needs, without sacrificing quality nor reliability. And we loved it so much that we knew we had to make it available to others. You can read more of our story <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boldermail.com\/our-story\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Our second difference is that we do not use your WordPress server to deliver emails. Unlike other WordPress plugins, and similar to Mailchimp and MailerLite, a separate server does all of the heavy lifting for you! This ensures that your website does not get sluggish as it struggles to send emails to subscribers.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Visit the Plugins page within your WordPress dashboard and select &#8220;Add New&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Search for &#8220;Boldermail&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Activate Boldermail from your Plugins page.<\/li>\n<li>Follow the instructions in the Getting Started guide <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boldermail.com\/knowledge-base\/getting-started-with-boldermail\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Note that this plugin is meant to communicate with our servers at Boldermail.

Our mailing servers use <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/ses\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Amazon Simple Email Services<\/a>, which is incredibly reliable. When we setup your Boldermail account, we will verify your email address and\/or web address to make sure email hosting providers do not flag your emails as spam.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='my%20newsletter%20list%20is%20important%20to%20me.%20why%20should%20i%20trust%20my%20business%20to%20you%3F'>\nMy newsletter list is important to me. Why should I trust my business to you?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Boldermail is more than just a service to us \u2014 it\u2019s an integral part of our business. My wife, Lindsey, runs The Postman\u2019s Knock, the #1 resource for learning calligraphy online. We have a list of 100,000 subscribers, and we send over 15 million emails per year. We developed Boldermail to save on costs without compromising on quality, and we have been using it as our own email marketing platform since 2018. (You can read more about our story <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boldermail.com\/our-story\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.) I can guarantee you that we strive to make Boldermail the best it can be because we depend on it 100%!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20your%20service%20compare%20to%20other%20free%20wordpress%20plugins%3F'>\nHow does your service compare to other free WordPress plugins?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unlike most WordPress plugins, we do not use your WordPress website to send the newsletters. Using your WordPress site to send emails in bulk is a bad idea, and may lead to your visitors having slow loading times or seeing errors on your frontend. We utilize separate powerful servers to deliver your emails.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20your%20plugin%20compare%20with%20other%20premium%20wordpress%20plugins%3F'>\nHow does your plugin compare with other premium WordPress plugins?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some premium plugins use your WordPress site to send emails. Others charge you hefty fees to deliver the emails for you. We are cheaper than the competition because our servers use Amazon Simple Email Services, and that translates into hundreds or thousands of dollars of savings to you! Calculate your savings <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boldermail.com\/#pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20your%20service%20compare%20to%20other%20services%2C%20like%20mailchimp%20or%20mailerlite%3F'>\nHow does your service compare to other services, like Mailchimp or MailerLite?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Mailchimp and MailerLite are great services. We speak from experience, as we have used them both in the past (you can read about our journey <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boldermail.com\/a-journey-from-feedburner-to-aweber-to-mailchimp-to-our-own-platform-boldermail\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.) However, as your subscriber list increases, their costs increase dramatically. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boldermail.com\/#pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">save thousands of dollars<\/a> a year using our services! The first difference you will see is in the interface \u2014 Mailchimp has a sleek albeit separate interface, while Boldermail utilizes a WordPress-native approach. The second difference is that we do not provide all of Mailchimp\u2019s extra features, like landing pages, Facebook and Instagram ads, postcards, etc. We focus exclusively on the email marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='does%20boldermail%20work%20with%20rss%20feeds%3F'>\nDoes Boldermail work with RSS feeds?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! The first email automation feature we developed for Boldermail was the ability to automatically send new blog post notifications to our subscribers. Not only can you setup Boldermail to deliver your freshly-created blog content to your subscribers, but you can also customize your template any way you want. The plugin will even convert embedded videos into email-friendly images for you!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>2.3.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix issue with list block.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.3.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix paragraph&#8217;s copy and paste function.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.3.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix watermark in YouTube and Vimeo videos.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add template UI for block editor.<\/li>\n<li>Add support for emojis in subject line.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor fixes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add block editor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.7.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix bugs in editor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.7.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add button to send a test email from editor.<\/li>\n<li>Newsletter content now saves automatically every minute.<\/li>\n<li>Improve UI for RSS feeds.<\/li>\n<li>Minor bug fixes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.6.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update Vimeo API.<\/li>\n<li>Add compatibility with Gravity Forms via add-on plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.6.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add custom fields to lists.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow users to send to multiple lists per newsletter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add email automation interface.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add opens + clicks rate reporting to newsletters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.5<\/h4>\n<p>Release Date: December 26th, 2019<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store more subscriber data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.4<\/h4>\n<p>Release Date: December 22nd, 2019<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change display of permalinks in templates.<\/li>\n<li>Improve display of subscribers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.3<\/h4>\n<p>Release Date: December 21st, 2019<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve subscriber navigation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow more shortcodes inside links.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix issue with [boldermail_name] shortcode.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.0<\/h4>\n<p>Release Date: December 18th, 2019<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add option to delete campaigns.<\/li>\n<li>Improve error handling and error messages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<p>Release Date: December 15th, 2019<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve error handling.<\/li>\n<li>Add email customization with [boldermail_name] shortcode.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve subscriber syncing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<p>Release Date: December 4th, 2019<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial commit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/boldermail\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2333684\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/boldermail\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2333684\" alt=\"The email template builder is powered by the new Gutenberg block editor.\"><\/a><p>The email template builder is powered by the new Gutenberg block editor.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/boldermail\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2333684\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/boldermail\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2333684\" alt=\"Add a new subscriber.

Their customer service takes care of everything and they even made some newsletter templates for me with specific requirements, so the learning process was super fast and easy. Prices are incredibly reasonable and tailored to your needs, so I'm saving a lot compared to my previous service. The transition to Boldermail was painless (I'd been putting off leaving the previous company because of all the hassle I thought it would involve).\n\nThey've also just implemented a drag and drop type editor, making things even more intuitive. Totally recommend this plugin and the service in general.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">A fantastic plugin<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/inkstruck\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/21a317decf491bef2dfc0c703febb986?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/21a317decf491bef2dfc0c703febb986?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/inkstruck\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">inkstruck<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">January 9, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">When I saw a fellow blogger share about Boldermail on her Instagram stories, I was curious to see how she able to send out newsletters to her thousands of followers for a fraction of the cost it usually is. I'm so happy I took the chance to change my newsletter platform because this plugin really delivers. The instructions are very clear and there is quite a bit of setting up to do but it has been very well explained on the website. The customer service is amazing and I was able to resolve any issues I had very quickly.\nOne of the things I would love to see is more template options and also a way to use the drag and drop option to create a template. But these are just minor things amongst the many other amazing ones.\nThank you so for creating this wonderful plugin.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/boldermail.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/boldermail\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2333684","caption":"The email template builder is powered by the new Gutenberg block editor."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/boldermail\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2333684","caption":"Add a new subscriber.
