It adds extra options on your blog&#8217;s comment form to select<br \/>\nwhich commenters you are replying to. Submitting the reply comment will trigger the e-mail generation function thus<br \/>\nsend them automatically. You can customize your own notification e-mail or use the default one.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Download the archive file and decompress it.<\/li>\n<li>Upload the file named <code>commentmailer.php<\/code> into your <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory. Remember, the <code>commentmailer.php<\/code> file should reside directly in the \/plugins\/ directory, not in subdirectory of it.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the <code>Plugins<\/code> menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Now, each time you want to reply someone&#8217;s comment on the comment system, you will see a multiple selection list consisting all visitors&#8217;s name who throwed a comment on the current post. Select which commenters you are replying to.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Why I don&#8217;t see any extra options on the comment submission form?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably because your theme doesn&#8217;t have the &#8216;comment_form&#8217; hook. I use this hook to automatically insert<br \/>\na menu to select which commenters you are replying to. If it&#8217;s the problem, just an extra template tag. Open your theme<br \/>\nfile (usually comments.php) And insert the following template tag: <code>&lt;?php commentmailer_form(); ?&gt;<\/code> between the <code>&lt;form&gt;<\/code> and <code>&lt;\/form&gt;<\/code> tags.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/commentmailer.0.1.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"comment":"comment","discussion":"discussion","e-mail":"e-mail","email":"email"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/commentmailer.0.1.zip","0.1-alpha":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/commentmailer.0.1-alpha.zip","0.1-beta":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/commentmailer.0.1-beta.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/commentmailer.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
