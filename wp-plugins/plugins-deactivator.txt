When clicked, every plugin (except for this one) will be deactivated. However, all active plugins are remembered.<\/p>\n<p>After the plugins are deactivated, a button will appear to reactivate them. This will reactivate only the plugins that were active before &#8211; plugins that were inactive will not be enabled.<\/p>\n<p>This is helpful for users who need to troubleshoot plugin conflicts by deactivating plugins in bulk. Without this plugin, you&#8217;d have to reactivate plugins based on memory. If there are a lot of plugins running on the site, with numerous plugins that are disabled, this can be difficult to do without first creating a list of what was active and inactive.<\/p>\n<p>With the Plugins Deactivator plugin, you can easily disable all plugins at once. With one more click, you can restore your plugins to where they were before.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.<\/p>\n<h3>Automatically<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Search for Plugins Deactivator in the Add New Plugin section of the WordPress admin<\/li>\n<li>Install &amp; Activate<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Manually<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the zip file and upload <code>plugins-deactivator<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20support%20for%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nDo you offer support for this plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have any questions, feel free to post a thread on the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/plugin\/plugins-deactivator\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve check for excluding this plugin from Plugins_Deactivator-&gt;deactivate_plugins().<\/li>\n<li>Bump WordPress Test up to version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/plugins-deactivator\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2613725\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/plugins-deactivator\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2613725\" alt=\"The &quot;Deactivate All Plugins&quot; button added to the plugins list page in the wp-admin.\"><\/a><p>The \"Deactivate All Plugins\" button added to the plugins list page in the wp-admin.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Worked perfect!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/markgood\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0c17bf2ec7a402961a33a99afac62b1e?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0c17bf2ec7a402961a33a99afac62b1e?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/markgood\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">markgood<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">January 6, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hasn't been updated in a year and just worked great on my version 6.11.
