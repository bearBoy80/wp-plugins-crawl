It hasn't affected performance negatively, so I'm all for it. I may even upgrade to the premium simply because if I say to myself, \"I'll remember to check it myself for free,\" I know I'll forget\u2014moreover, the premium version updates daily rather than weekly. For less than 20 bucks a year, it seems worth it.  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/core-vitals-monitor.1.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/core-vitals-monitor\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2803534","caption":"Tools page.
