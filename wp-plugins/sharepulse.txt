SharePulse finds and ranks your site&#8217;s posts that have the greatest <em>social<\/em> impact. The stats are gathered by getting the Twitter share count, Facebook share count, LinkedIn share count as well as your own site&#8217;s most commented posts measuring actual engagement. SharePulse lets you display these posts in your site&#8217;s sidebar showing off your posts which have had the greatest social impact over the past day, week, month year or for all time. Each post is displayed with the total number of tweets, shares and comments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> This is the alpha for the plugin relaunch. Feedback is crucial, so please don&#8217;t hesitate. We have a feature roadmap and <a href=\"http:\/\/sharepulse.net\/contact\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">we want your input<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The Facebook api has been tightened, it may not update each time.
