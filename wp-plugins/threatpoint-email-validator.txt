One use of this is to prevent spam bots inputting content into comments, easily and effectively<\/p>\n<h3>External Service<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin allows administrators include email validation using a real time verification service provided by the ThreatPoint email verification API.<br \/>\nThe Plugin uses existing is_email functionality and passes manually entered email addresses to the restAPI service at ThreatPoint.<br \/>\nThe response back from the ThreatPoint API provides information related to the email validity(valid email, valid domain, disposable, free, role, risk score). Automatically stop spam bots from entering comments onto your posts by verifying the email address first.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin calls the rest API (requires an API KEY) at <a href=\"https:\/\/verify.threatpoint.co.uk\/api\/v1\/resources\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this ThreatPoint api endpoint<\/a><br \/>\nThe rest API is only passed the email address from the contact form via the is_email function.<br \/>\nThis external service is called whenever a form using is_email is used. By default the Contact Form 7 is supported. You can include any form field name (email address field) in the plugin to override the default.<br \/>\nAn API key is required to utilise the service, although the plugin will operate without one it will not be able to pass the email address or call any data from the API.<br \/>\nYour email addresses will not be validated without a valid API key.<\/p>\n<h3>Privacy Policy<\/h3>\n<p>The privacy policy for the api services is viewable here <a href=\"https:\/\/threatpoint.co.uk\/privacy-policy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">privacy policy<\/a><br \/>\nThis plugin only passes the email address information &#8211; no other PII is transferred. The email address is analysed across the aggregated data within the ThreatPoint email verification reputation service and a risk score with email properties (valid, free, role, disposable) to the plugin. Simple rules within the plugin dictate whether the email address is considered valid(set through the plugin settings). The email address is stored in the email address aggregated data and used as part of email address consortium for all customers. No other data such as originating website is stored. Only the email address  is held, with date, time and risk scores associated with the request.<\/p>\n<h3>Plugin Features<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Validates email addresses in real time including:<\/li>\n<li>Valid email<\/li>\n<li>Valid domain<\/li>\n<li>Disposable Addresses (One time Use)<\/li>\n<li>Role\/Group Addresses<\/li>\n<li>Free Email Addresses<\/li>\n<li>Breached Email Addresses<\/li>\n<li>Email Addresses known to be high risk (spam)<\/li>\n<li>API Documentation is available here: <a href=\"https:\/\/threatpoint.co.uk\/documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Video is here <span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YD9CAx4f3FM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Special Features<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide real time email validation and decisions through configuration to allow an administrator the correct flow for their site.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Configuration Items<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>API Key &#8211; An API key is required to access the email address validation service as explained above &#8211; (api@threatpoint.co.uk)<\/li>\n<li>Blacklisted domains &#8211; a list of domains that you would not wish to have entered into your forms<\/li>\n<li>Email Field Name &#8211; the field name to pick the email address values from.
