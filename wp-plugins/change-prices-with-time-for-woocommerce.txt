For each defined date, the product price will change into the price that you&#8217;ve defined.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WooCommerce 3.0 is requested. It won&#8217;t work on version below 3.0.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This plugin will directly change the <strong>Regular Price<\/strong> of your product, it won&#8217;t save the regular price since it will be changed directly. This is done so that you may also delete all the sales points but retain the last price change of your product.<\/p>\n<p>There will be a countdown displayed below the product summary. This countdown will then build up scarcity so that your customers can&#8217;t resist into buying your product.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Perfect when launching your next WooCommerce product or membership!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Create your launch and define the early bird price. Then create different time points and the price that will then become available.<br \/>\nIn case you use the new layout with prices, your visitors will see to which price it will increase.<\/p>\n<p>Since it works with the product regular prices (or sale prices), you can use it with:<br \/>\n&#8211; WooCommerce Simple Product<br \/>\n&#8211; WooCommerce Variable Products (Premium)<br \/>\n&#8211; WooCommerce Subscription Products (Simple ones)<br \/>\n&#8211; WooCommerce Memberships<\/p>\n<p>Features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define Time points that will change the Simple Product Regular Price<\/li>\n<li>Countdown on the front page to build scarcity<\/li>\n<li>Automatic restart of the countdown if there are more than 1 time point.

Example Scenario: Increase price every hour from today until a maximum price has been met.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>If you want to change prices with each or several sales (instead of time), I have another plugin for you so be sure to check my plugins on my page.
