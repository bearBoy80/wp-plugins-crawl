Do you also like to be able to pack up early on a Friday?<br \/>\nNow you can be both! Offer your customers the BEST shipping deals that are going to get out TODAY! Charge an extra fee (or don&#8217;t), but cut the deal off at 3pm on Friday (or any other day!)<\/p>\n<p>Promote shipping deals on special orders that let YOU guide your customers into making decisions that benefit your bottom line.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong><br \/>\nAverage order is 1 t-shirt for $20. It costs you $6 to ship anywhere with your rate. If a customer orders up to 3 t-shirts, it still only costs you $6 to ship.<br \/>\nUsing this plugin, you can make a ruleset either via product categories or shipping classes to offer a new shipping rate if a customer orders 2 or 3 t-shirts rather than 1 or 4+<\/p>\n<p><strong>Example 2:<\/strong><br \/>\nYou have a scheduled pickup with your shipping service of choice TheRiteShipping Co. at 3:30pm every day. On your website you have &#8220;2 day delivery&#8221; as an option, but it really counts as 3+ days if they order at 3:45pm.<br \/>\nUsing this plugin, you can disable the &#8220;2 day shipping&#8221; option at 3:30pm every day until midnight or even over a weekend (or time span) to reduce friction and confusion among your customers.<\/p>\n<p>See screenshots for examples of making an &#8220;advanced flat rate&#8221; method.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>woo-advanced-shipping-methods<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='a%20question%20that%20someone%20might%20have'>\nA question that someone might have\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>An answer to that question.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2463963\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2463963\" alt=\"Category, Shipping Class, and Quantity based shipping method settings, check the next screenshot for the time limited settings just below these options on the screen.\"><\/a><p>Category, Shipping Class, and Quantity based shipping method settings, check the next screenshot for the time limited settings just below these options on the screen.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2463963\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2463963\" alt=\"Time based settings, as well as extra Shipping Class based cost settings.\"><\/a><p>Time based settings, as well as extra Shipping Class based cost settings.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2463963\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2463963\" alt=\"Filled in Time Limited shipping method preventing this method form sahowing up from Friday at 3:30pm until Sunday at 11:30pm.\"><\/a><p>Filled in Time Limited shipping method preventing this method form sahowing up from Friday at 3:30pm until Sunday at 11:30pm.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2463963\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2463963\" alt=\"Blank Time Limited shipping method settings.\"><\/a><p>Blank Time Limited shipping method settings.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2463963\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2463963\" alt=\"Example of the newly created &quot;Advanced Flat Rate&quot; Shipping Method within a Shipping Zone.\"><\/a><p>Example of the newly created \"Advanced Flat Rate\" Shipping Method within a Shipping Zone.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/asm-wc.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2463963","caption":"Category, Shipping Class, and Quantity based shipping method settings, check the next screenshot for the time limited settings just below these options on the screen."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2463963","caption":"Time based settings, as well as extra Shipping Class based cost settings."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2463963","caption":"Filled in Time Limited shipping method preventing this method form sahowing up from Friday at 3:30pm until Sunday at 11:30pm."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2463963","caption":"Blank Time Limited shipping method settings."},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/asm-wc\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2463963","caption":"Example of the newly created \"Advanced Flat Rate\" Shipping Method within a Shipping Zone."}},"tags":{"advanced-shipping":"advanced shipping","time-based-shipping":"time based shipping","woocommerce-shipping-methods":"WooCommerce Shipping methods"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.theritesites.com","banners":[]}
