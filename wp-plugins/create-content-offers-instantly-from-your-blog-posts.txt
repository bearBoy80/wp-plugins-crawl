A content offer is a small piece of content like a checklist that you give in exchange for the reader sharing their email to you. But creating content offers takes time and effort, so I made a plugin that automates the process a bit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What this plugin does:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Adds a double opt-in subscription box at the end of your posts to help you collect emails from your readers. The email is added to an internal list and also into your MailChimp list if you have one.<\/li>\n<li>Upon sharing their email, the reader is given an automatically created content offer. For this initial release, it&#8217;s a checklist generated from the existing headings of your blog post. For best results, use this on your list posts and &#8220;how to&#8221; posts.<\/li>\n<li>You can also customize the text in the subscription box and content offer.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/glennsantos.org\/create-content-offers\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read here to learn more about the plugin<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s enough people who ask for it, I might add more autogenerated content offers to the plugin like spreadsheets, questionnaires, blog to PDF, etc,<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>In the admin area of your WordPress site, tap on <strong>Plugins<\/strong> in the menu at the left.<\/li>\n<li>At the top of the page, tap on <strong>Add New<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Search for <strong>Create Content Offers Instantly From Your Blog Posts<\/strong>  using the search box at the upper right.<\/li>\n<li>Tap on <strong>Install Now<\/strong>, wait for the plugin to install, then tap on <strong>Activate<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Go to <strong>Content Offer Emails<\/strong> in your admin menu to modify the default options.
