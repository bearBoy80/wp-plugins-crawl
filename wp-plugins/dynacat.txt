Ideal for websites that feature a huge number of categories and sub categories for posts. When your website has many categories, selecting your required category from the drop-down selector can lead to tiresome scrolling \u2013 especially when the category you want to select is near the bottom of the list.<\/p>\n<p>Dynacat takes away that problem by replacing the standard drop-down list selection with a dynamic search box. To select the category for your post, simply begin to type in the search box. As you type, a list of categories appears that matches your criteria. The list changes with each letter you type, before your chosen category is easy to select.<\/p>\n<p>This is designed for sites with a large selection of categories.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>dynacat<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20select%20the%20category%20when%20i%20can%20see%20it%20in%20the%20list%3F'>\nHow do I select the Category when I can see it in the list?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply click the Category, it will become bold and will fill in the field with that value, then make sure you publish\/update your post.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20start%20with%20the%20first%20letters%20of%20the%20category%E2%80%99s%20name%3F'>\nDo I have to start with the first letters of the category\u2019s name?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the plugin will search any part of the category\u2019s name, for instance, to find \u2018Steven\u2019, you could start to type \u2018even\u2019 and it will appear in the list of potential matches.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20have%20multiple%20sub%20categories%20of%20the%20same%20name%3F'>\nWhat if I have multiple sub categories of the same name?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is exactly what this plugin was designed for. As you type, the categories appear with their parent categories, so you can easily select the correct category even when you have multiple categories of the same name.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>n\/a<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dynacat\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2804906\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dynacat\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2804906\" alt=\"The Dynacat box in the right sidebar of a post edit screen.\"><\/a><p>The Dynacat box in the right sidebar of a post edit screen.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/dynacat.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dynacat\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2804906","caption":"The Dynacat box in the right sidebar of a post edit screen."}},"tags":{"category":"category","dynamic-list":"dynamic list"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
