This plugin seems to be able to do this. However:\n1. Even it's possible to remove some fields in the checkout, like Shipping or Billing, the name of the fields remain and the overall page looks broken\n2. In the process of buying a user has to click on quantity at least once, even though there is no sense in even using quantities in digital downloads. \n3. In the check out process the very first field is suggesting to make an account on the website. These fields aren't removable. Users can ignore them but in most cases, this will cause users to stop the process. Users often don't like to make new accounts especially when they need only to buy goods and not becoming a member of a website. \n4. The design is really ugly and there is no way to improve it within the plugin's settings. Any default checkouts by WooCommerce is a million times better designed than this.\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sunshine-photo-cart.3.0.22.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sunshine-photo-cart\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2963250","caption":"Main galleries view using Twenty Twenty One theme - Note: Private Galleries show only for logged in admin users or for users assigned to the gallery"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sunshine-photo-cart\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2963250","caption":"Single gallery view.
