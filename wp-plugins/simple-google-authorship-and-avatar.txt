An already registered application is used as a proxy for authentication and using the API, and no extra work is involved. For the user, authentication, and gathering the required info, is just one click away from their profile page.<\/p>\n<p>Once authenticated, anyone who can edit the user?s profile can set it to show or hide authorship and use google profile picture as avatar.<\/p>\n<p>Please read the installation instructions, there is more there then the trivial instructions<\/p>\n<p><strong>Network use<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The plugin will work for any sub site in the network for which it was activated (or if the plugin is network activated).<\/p>\n<p>Any change the user will make to its profile will impact all the sites in the netwrok in which the user had posted or commented.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Limitations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>User still needs to add the site to his G+ profile \\?contributor to\\? or \\?profile\\? links in order for the google authorship to work.<br \/>\nOnly the user can authenticate himself, therefor an admin can not set authorship or avatar instead of the user.<br \/>\nIn network usage, sub sites admins can?t edit other users profile therefor they will not have any control and only the super admin will be able to change the settings.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Install from the repository.
