It makes WordPress logins truly passwordless.  I have no idea how I have only just found Trusona.  There are a few other plugin options out there but they all require extra setup, but with Trusona you just install the plugin and away you go.  You need to install the Trusona app on your mobile device and link the email address you use with your WordPress account, this is the link between WordPress account and the app.  If you manage several WordPress sites and each account on each website has a different email address, then you'll need to add each of these unique email addresses to the Trusona app.  Once you've done that logging in is simply a case of approving the login on your phone.

Trusona is excellent and has proved extremely effective and their support has been outstanding. I was having an issue with the Classic Login facility and dropped them an email. They responded immediately and provided a fix the following morning. You really cannot ask more than that! I have added Trusona to all my sites now and I can thoroughly recommend it. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Fantastic CLEF Replacement!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tfx1\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/79c73e8c1f9dbf16a2f87920b2d115f1?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/79c73e8c1f9dbf16a2f87920b2d115f1?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tfx1\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Jay <small>(tfx1)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">June 24, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I am very impressed with this so far and can't understand why I haven't heard more about it! I found this plugin while searching for CLEF alternatives after wasting the best part of a week trying to get Updraft Keyy to work (Read my review on their plugin page if you want specifics!) on 13 sites with no success. \n\nUnlike Keyy, Trusona works as advertised and is extremely easy to install and quite \"slick\" too. There's just a couple of things missing that would really make this perfect for me:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Allow users to change the image (A guy in a suite) shown during the login process.<\/li>\n\t<li>Option to \"log out\". At the moment you have to remember to log out manually, unless I've missed something.<\/li>\n\t<li>More admin options. I can only find one option that lets you choose if you want Trusona as the only login option or if you want Trusona and passwords.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\nThe fact that this is totally free and includes support baffles me as I would be happy to pay for this!

I tried it out at home with my WordPress website and it worked great. \n\nHere's a few tips you might want to know if you haven't started using it yet. I have a Samsung Galaxy phone and didn't have the screen password protected. So, when I installed the Trusona app for Android and opened it up. I got a message saying that in order to use it, I had to setup a password protected screen. I went ahead and setup an alphanumeric password on my phone and was finally able to carry on with finishing the setup of my Trusona app and connection with my WordPress website.\n\nHowever, today I decided to switch my phone's screen alphanumeric password to a pattern password instead. After I did this, Trusona stoppped working for me. Nevertheless, I didn't panic. I figured that me changing from a alphanumeric password to a pattern password probably had something to do with the problem and indeed that was the issue.\n\nI wasn't really sure on how to look up a support article for this particular problem since the wording for a search was rather complicated to slim down to just a few words. So, I called Truson'as free support line (1-888-Trusona) and explained the issue to see what next. They answered the phone on around the third ring which actually surprised me since I'm used to having to wait a long time on hold for people to simply pick up. I then followed the rep's instructions and was finally able to restore the QR code authentication feature again within no time. These guys are super friendly which was a total breath of fresh air.\n\nThe person I spoke to was by far the most patient and easy going person I may have ever spoken to over the phone for troubleshooting guidance. I also noticed that on the official website, a small banner message came up confirming that Microsoft has now partnered up with Trusona as an investor for their operations. So, that news only makes it more comforting for me to know that I'm using the Trusona plugin for my WordPress site since Microsoft is a strong fortress within the security field.\n\nI originally planned to install the CLEF plugin in order to manage authentications to my website but after I found out that they would be retiring their product for good this year. I started looking for a reliable alternative solution and I found several bloggers talking about other security plugins which didn't seem bad but I saw several comments from random website visitors putting in a good word for Trusona. So, I decided to try it out and so far it's been working great and the best part of it all is the fact that it's free as well.\n\nIn conclusion, you can't go wrong if you choose these guys to secure your website. So there you have it, an in depth end user experience reassuring you won't be disappointed with Trusona.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/trusona.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/trusona\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2510191","caption":"Separate factors from friction.
