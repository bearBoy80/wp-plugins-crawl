For us, the only modules not included in the free version are:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} -->\n<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Take payments online. Although you can setup Direct Payments you can have more gateways when getting the WooCommerce addon (purchase). Our feeling is that the plugin needs more gateways options but is sure it will come with time.<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Service providers. A paid addon is available to setup service providers at a very affordable rate.<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item --><\/ol>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The plugin was design with a well though logical flow and the moment you understand it, you can setup a booking system which will not break the bank.
