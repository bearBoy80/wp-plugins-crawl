Find the set up of a shopping cart system (such as woocommerce) too overwhelming? <em>EZ PayPal<\/em> may be the right solution for you, especially if you want to sell downloadable, digital goods. <em>EZ PayPal<\/em> can, however, handle physical goods as well, if you want to sell one item at a time without an add to cart, check out workflow.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sunset Edition<\/strong><br \/>\n  This update of the plugin is the last publicly released version.

(In fact, it is only a mouseover away.)<\/li>\n<li>Automatic validation of admin and setup entries to minimize errors: <em>EZ PayPal<\/em> catches all the usual data entry errors so that you can afford to be a bit sloppy.<\/li>\n<li>No programming knowledge required: <em>EZ PayPal<\/em> is written for creative people who have some digital products to sell. So it doesn&#8217;t call for any deep computing knowledge. The most you will have to do is perhaps to set permission to a couple of folders.<\/li>\n<li>IPN handling: <em>EZ PayPal<\/em> handles all the complex PayPal instant notification and data transfer to prevent unauthorized access.<\/li>\n<li>Automatic download pages: Buyers are automatically redirected to a customized download page.<\/li>\n<li>Self-service download link retrieval: If the PayPal information is not yet received by your server, <em>EZ PayPal<\/em> shows your buyer a page where he can retrieve his purchase link. (This feature reduced my support load by 90%).<\/li>\n<li>Automated emails: In addition to the download page, <em>EZ PayPal<\/em> sends an automated email with the download link to your buyer as well. Just in case&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Easy Inventory maintenance: Easy to add new products to your inventory.<\/li>\n<li>Automatic generation of an online shop: Once the first product is added, you can already see it on your <em>EZ PayPal<\/em> online shop.<\/li>\n<li>Sandbox mode: <em>EZ PayPal<\/em> gives you the option to choose PayPal sandbox mode so that you can check your setup before going live.<\/li>\n<li>Timely help: <em>EZ PayPal<\/em> sports a context-sensitive help system, so that you get timely help as you need it.<\/li>\n<li>WordPress integration: This application can be run as a WordPress plugin or as a fully standalone web application with its own database layer as you so choose. What&#8217;s more, you can switch to the standalone mode from the WordPress plugin admin page of this application, while still using the WordPress authentication mechanism and database.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>EZ PayPal<\/em> is available as a <a href=\"http:\/\/buy.thulasidas.com\/ezpaypal\" title=\"Get EZ PayPal Pro for $19.95\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Premium WordPress plugin<\/a> which also works as a standalone web application. The standalone package is appropriate if you have multiple websites selling your products, but want to keep your sales consolidated.<\/p>\n<h4>Security Features<\/h4>\n<p>Since <em>EZ PayPal<\/em> deals with money, it takes the security and integrity of your data very seriously. It also puts serious roadblocks to prevent unauthorized access to your server.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>All login type actions are implemented in such a way as to virtually eliminate the possibility of SQL injection or SQL-based DoS attacks.<\/li>\n<li>The set up scripts do not let you set up your installation twice. In fact, they won&#8217;t even display the setup information the second time you run it. Reinstallation will require database manipulation.<\/li>\n<li>Only one admin user is permitted. You cannot add another admin user. You can edit and modify the admin details only after entering the current password.<\/li>\n<li>There is no interface to recover your password once you install your system. No amount of database hacking will recover it. So please be careful to note it down in some secure location. Password may be reset using one-time emial link though.<\/li>\n<li>Strong validation of all user entries exposed to the world at the client-side, server-side as well at the database layer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Pro Features<\/h4>\n<p>In addition to the fully functional Lite version, there is a Pro Version with many more features. These features are highlighted by a red icon in the menus of the lite version.<\/p>\n<p>If the following features are important to you, consider buying the Pro version.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>HTML Emails<\/em>: In the <em>Pro<\/em> version, you can send impressive HTML email to your customers based on your own design rather than the boring plain text messages.<\/li>\n<li><em>PDT Handling<\/em>: Payment Data Transfer posts the data to your return page, which the <em>Pro<\/em> version makes use of, in preparing the return page. This can be critical when there is a delay in PayPal posting the IPN messages to the listener.<\/li>\n<li><em>Address Handling<\/em>: The <em>Pro<\/em> version can optionally store the customer address details in a database table, if you need it.<\/li>\n<li><em>IPN Relay<\/em>: If you have other IPN listeners, the <em>Pro<\/em> version of <em>EZ PayPal<\/em> can relay the IPN messages to them, so that they receive the same IPN messages, enabling integration with multiple systems.<\/li>\n<li><em>Template Editor<\/em>: The email body, thank you page and download display are all editable in the <em>Pro<\/em> version.<\/li>\n<li><em>Logo and Branding<\/em>: EZ PayPal <em>Pro<\/em> gives you options to set your own logo on your shop\/return pages and even on PayPal checkout page. You can also change the color scheme of these pages.<\/li>\n<li><em>Automatic handling of refunds and disputes<\/em>: When you issue a refund on the PayPal website, the corresponding sale in your database will be set to inactive. And if a buyer registers a dispute, he (and you) will get a friendly email message stating that the dispute is being reviewed and handled.<\/li>\n<li><em>E-Check handling<\/em>: The <em>Pro<\/em> version recognizes e-check payments and sends a mail to the buyer regarding the delay for the check clearance.<\/li>\n<li><em>Sales Editor<\/em>: You can load a single sale or a bunch of sales on to a friendly interface and change their data. For instance, it will let you change the download expiry date and resend a download notification message &#8212; one of the frequent support requests from the buyers.<\/li>\n<li><em>Email Tools<\/em>: You can select a number of your buyers to notify, for example, of a critical update of your products, or of a free upgrade opportunity.<\/li>\n<li><em>Product Version Support<\/em>: The <em>Pro<\/em> version supports versioning of your products. It will keep track of the version sold to your buyers and your current versions. So, if you want to send a product and version specific upgrade notice, you can do it with <em>Pro<\/em> version.<\/li>\n<li><em>Batch Upload<\/em>: EZ PayPal <em>Pro<\/em> gives an easy way (drag-and-drop) to upload your product files (when you release new versions, for instance), and keeps track of their versions.<\/li>\n<li><em>Product Updates<\/em>: Your customers can initiate product update checks. If the version they purchased is older than the current version on your shop, they can download the latest version. By default, the first update is provided free of cost, and the subsequent ones are chargeable at $0.95. This update policy is configurable on a product-by-product basis.<\/li>\n<li><em>Multi-Currency Support<\/em>: You can choose you currency on a per-product basis, and your auto-generated shop page will list the product with the right currency symbol.<\/li>\n<li><em>Product Meta Data Support<\/em>: Meta data is extra, free-form data you can attach to a product description. You can retrieve it and display it on you product description and download pages. The <em>Pro<\/em> version gives you a convenient editor to generate and modify product meta data.<\/li>\n<li><em>Upgradable Products<\/em>: You can define products that are upgradeable. For instance, you can sell a short eBook at an introductory price. If your buyer likes it, he has the option of buying the full book by paying the difference. (WIP)<\/li>\n<li><em>Troubleshooting Tools<\/em>: EZ PayPal <em>Pro<\/em> has the ability to email you detailed IPN log. It can also store the raw IPN data in the database for future investigation.<\/li>\n<li><em>Sales Statistics and Charts<\/em>: Maximize your sales by analyzing your sales. This reporting package makes slicing and dicing your sales and affiliate data a snap, so that you can spot opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><em>Subscription Module<\/em>: If you want to add subscription products (support contract, text links, newsletters etc), this module will make it a snap.<\/li>\n<li><em>Server Side Sales Processing<\/em>: Your sales are rendered in a searchable, sortable table (using bootstrap Datatables). In the <em>Pro<\/em> version, the table processing is done at your database server rather than the web browser, tremendously improving the performance once you have thousands of sales.<\/li>\n<li><em>Images Upload<\/em>: In the <em>Pro<\/em> version, you can upload your image assets to your server using a simple drag and drop interface and use them in your email and download templates, or as logos.<\/li>\n<li><em>Popup PayPal Window<\/em>: In the <em>Pro<\/em> version, you have an option to open the PayPal transaction page in a nice, compact window so that your buyers do not leave your shop to complete a purchase.<\/li>\n<li><em>Skinnable Shop and Return Pages<\/em>: In the <em>Pro<\/em> version, you can select the color schemes of your shop, return and update pages (as well as admin pages) from nine different skins.<\/li>\n<li><em>Flexible Shop Layout<\/em>: In EZ PayPal <em>Pro<\/em>, you can select either the default table view or a lis\/grid view for your e-shop display. The list\/grid view is switchable on the frontend as well.<\/li>\n<li><em>Tax Support<\/em>: In the Pro version, you can set up a tax rate to be applied to your transactions, and override it on a per-product basis, either as a flat tax or as a product-specific tax rate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Optional Packages<\/h4>\n<p><em>EZ PayPal<\/em> is designed to be extensible. The following add-on extensions are ready or being tested.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/buy.thulasidas.com\/ezsupport-module\" title=\"ezSupport for only $7.95\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ezSupport<\/a>: Every complex software project, once deployed, generates significant support load. Most of the support questions are frivolous, where the end-user presents silly issues that are easily resolved by a cursory look at the documentation. How do we ask the end-user to RTFM without antagonizing them? I found that it could be done by switching to a paid support model. I started charging 95 cents per support questions, and my support load went down by two orders of magnitude. This ezSupport package is built on the excellent osTicket program. It works hand in hand with EZ PayPal and provides you with a configurable support system.

Do you get a lot of requests for text links? They can be significantly more lucrative (by a factor of 100, in my case) than contextual ads such as AdSense. The returns can be even greater if you can deal with your advertisers directly, rather than via providers like Text Link Ads that take 50% of your revenue. ezTextLinks will handle payment, activate and expire links, send reminder emails and handle renewals etc. The plugin version is available as Easy Text Links in <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/easy-text-links\" title=\"Lite version of Easy Text Links\" rel=\"ugc\">Lite<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/buy.thulasidas.com\/easy-text-links\" title=\"Manage your text links like a pro for $7.95\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro<\/a> variants.<\/li>\n<li>Express Checkout: Express Checkout is a way to integrate PayPal even more seamlessly with your web site by letting your buyer complete the purchase process without leaving your product page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The reporting module and the subscription module that were sold separately have now been integrated with the <a href=\"http:\/\/buy.thulasidas.com\/ezpaypal\" title=\"Get EZ PayPal Pro for $19.95\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro<\/a> version of this package.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>To install it as a WordPress plugin, please use the plugin installation interface.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search for the plugin EZ PayPal from your admin menu Plugins -&gt; Add New.<\/li>\n<li>Click on install.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It can also be installed from a downloaded zip archive.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to your admin menu Plugins -&gt; Add New, and click on &#8220;Upload Plugin&#8221; near the top.<\/li>\n<li>Browse for the zip file and click on upload.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Once uploaded and activated,<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit the EZ PayPal plugin admin page to configure it.<\/li>\n<li>Take a tour of the plugin features from the EZ PayPal admin menu Tour and Help.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you would like to temporarily switch to the standalone mode of the plugin, click on the &#8220;Standalone Mode&#8221; button near the top right corner of EZ PayPal admin screens.

Do you have more documentation?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will find a help button on almost every admin screen of <em>EZ PayPal<\/em> near the top right side of every panel. Clicking on it will bring up a nice dialog box with context-sensitive help.<\/p>\n<p>To get started, you might want to use the admin menu item &#8220;Tour and Help.&#8221; The tour will walk you through the features, and the help text on the page will give you everything you need to get started.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I use this plugin to ship physical goods?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although EZ PayPal is designed to handle downloadable digital goods or virtual services, I have implemented basic support for physical goods in the Pro version. To use it, add meta-data to the product.<br \/>\n1. Click on the Products menu item.<br \/>\n2. Add a new product or edit an existing one.<br \/>\n3. Click on the <em>Edit Meta Data<\/em> button to bring up the meta-data editor.<br \/>\n4. Create a new key-value pair with key (entry in the fist column) as <code>shipping<\/code> and the value (entry in the second column) to be the shipping charges. Also, ensure that you have defined the product to require the buyers to give their shipping address.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I have trouble uploading my products. What do I do?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your product files are uploaded into a directory with a random name (so that a potential hacker will have hard time guessing it). It is likely that your web server doesn&#8217;t have the privileges to create or modify this folder and files within. Click on the Show button on your Admin Control Panel to see what the directory name is. Then create the directory with that name, and apply <code>chmod 777<\/code> to make it writeable.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I manage products?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>To edit your products, use the menu item Products. It will list your products in an editable table. You can  click on any value in the table and edit it in place. If you would like to see all the attributes of the product, click on the edit button in the last column.<\/p>\n<p>In order to add a new product, click on the green &#8220;Add New Product&#8221; button and type in your values in the product creation screen.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why do I get error message saying something about direct access to plugin files?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin admin interface is designed with a loosely coupled architecture, which means it interacts with the WordPress core only for certain essential services (login check, plugin activation status, database access etc). Loosely coupled systems tend to be more robust and flexible than tightly integrated ones because they make fewer assumptions about each other. My plugin admin pages are fairly independent, and do not pollute the global scope or leak the style directives or JavaScript functions. In order to achieve this, they are loaded in iFrames within the WordPress admin interface.<\/p>\n<p>Your web server needs direct access to the plugin files to load anything in an iFrame. Some aggressive security settings block this kind of access, usually through an <code>.htaccess<\/code> file in your <code>wp-content<\/code> or <code>plugins<\/code> folders, which is why this plugin gives a corresponding error message if it detects inability to access the files (checked through a <code>file_get_contents<\/code> call on a plugin file URL). But some systems implement further blocks specifically on <code>file_get_contents<\/code> or on iFrames with specific styles (using <code>mod_securty<\/code> rules, for instance), which is why the plugin provides a means to override this auto-detection and force the admin page.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is the direct access to plugin files a security hole?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Note that it is only your own webserver that needs direct access to the PHP files. The reason for preventing such access is that a hacker might be able to upload a malicious PHP (or other executable script) to your web host, which your webserver will run if asked to. Such a concern is valid only on systems where you explicitly permit unchecked file uploads. For instance, if anyone can upload any file to your media folder, and your media folder is not protected against direct access and script execution, you have given the potential hacker an attack vector.<\/p>\n<p>In this plugin, its media\/banner upload folder has a multiple layers protection:<br \/>\n1. Only users logged in as admin can ever see the upload interface.<br \/>\n2. The upload script accepts only media file types.<br \/>\n3. The backend AJAX handler also checks for safe file types.<br \/>\n4. The media storage locations are protected against script execution.<\/p>\n<p>So allowing your webserver to serve the plugin admin files in an iFrame is completely safe, in my judgement.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>Future Plans<\/h4>\n<h4>History<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>V7.91: Compatibility with WP4.8.
