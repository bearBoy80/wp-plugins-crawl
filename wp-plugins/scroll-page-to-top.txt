This makes them really easy to view on tablets, but if the navigation isn&#8217;t visible, it can make it difficult for visitors to return to the top of the page. Some Web templates have a &#8216;back to top&#8217; button in the footer, but others don&#8217;t. Visitors find it helpful to have a button that fades into view as you scroll down and floats along the bottom of the browser.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Scroll Page To Top&#8221; plugin allows users to smoothly scroll back to the top of the page. It&#8217;s a little detail which enhances navigation experience on website with long pages.<\/p>\n<h3>Usage<\/h3>\n<p>It is very simple to use and does not require any technical skills. Install the plugin through the plugin interface then Go to Settings menu &gt; Select &#8220;Scroll Page To Top&#8221; menu and make changes and save it. You can customize the arrow icon, position, BG Color, Font-Size etc by plugin settings.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload &#8220;scroll-page-to-top&#8221; directory to the &#8220;wp-content\/plugins\/&#8221; directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Enjoy!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/scroll-page-to-top\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1925429\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/scroll-page-to-top\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1925429\" alt=\"Activate the plugin go to &quot;Scroll Page To Top&quot; menu under WordPress Settings and manage the plugin settings like as above screen.\"><\/a><p>Activate the plugin go to \"Scroll Page To Top\" menu under WordPress Settings and manage the plugin settings like as above screen.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great Plugin and Easy to Use<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pradeepsinghweb\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7ac4db3690942b9820598f25967d981f?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7ac4db3690942b9820598f25967d981f?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pradeepsinghweb\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">pradeepsinghweb<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 16, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This is very simple plugin and easy to use.
