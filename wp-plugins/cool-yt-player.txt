I tried 1000 plugins and no one was able to complete the task.\n\nCool YT Player did a miracle.\n\nI clicked install the plugin and that's it. No more settings. Insert the shortcode in the entry or on the page and your client will not be able to go to the YouTube channel.\n\nI wanted to make videos on YouTube, so that I could hide them later on my site. It worked.\n\nMANCA thank you so much for the plugin. I will use your plugin. \n\nI wish you success and please do not throw the plug-in into a solo swim.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/cool-yt-player.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"shortcodes":"shortcodes","video":"video","video-player":"video player","youtube":"youtube","youtube-player":"youtube player"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/cool-yt-player\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2328958","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/cool-yt-player\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2328958"}}
