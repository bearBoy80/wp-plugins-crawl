Up to now to properly do Multi-Networks with BuddyPress required the use of two plugins WP Multi Networks (or Networks+ once premium but now on github) &amp; bp multi-networks &amp; you also required some lines of wp-config to be commented out. With those plugins you could have clean separate networks each with a separate Network Admin page and separate BuddyPress \/bbPess instances and these plugins still work.\n\n<strong>Now comes this plugin<\/strong> - at first i was asking where are the Networks? (but that was because I was used to a separate Network Admin screen for each Network). But now, five weeks on, I ask is that really necessary when you have a wholly seperate buddypress and bbpress instance on each additional blog that can  separately avail of the whole BuddyPress\/bbPress eco-system.\n\nI actually now believe that this plugin is a game changer - simple to install and simple to undertand. Keeps it simple and also the proliferation of networks is far far easier and then the whole shebang is also easier to maintain and to manage.\n\nHaving played with Slack for a year I wasn't surprised by their Grand Slam.The Aussies always come back and bring something new to the game. Its looking the same for this Aussie's plugin. I really believe this plugin could be THE real gamechanger for multi-networking.\n\n*caveat: not a developer just a copy and paster coder, fan of open-source but not an absolutist. Believe that BuddyPress's best days are ahead.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lh-buddypress-multi-network.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"buddypress":"buddypress","multiple":"multiple","multisite":"multisite","network":"network","saas":"saas"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"https:\/\/lhero.org\/portfolio\/lh-buddypress-multi-network\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/lh-buddypress-multi-network\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2404430","high":false}}
