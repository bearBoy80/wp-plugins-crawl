It also provides a link to a public report on IP geolocation API <a href=\"https:\/\/geoipify.whoisxmlapi.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website<\/a> with regard to all the IPs both in the post text and the comments.<\/p>\n<p>The tooltip is displayed when you hover the cursor over an IP address in the text. You can then carry out a more in-depth research into the IP&#8217;s geolocation by following the link on IP Geolocation API website.<\/p>\n<p>The tooltips are integrated simultaneously, and the &#8216;IP Geolocation Info&#8217; plugin will not modify any of the content.
