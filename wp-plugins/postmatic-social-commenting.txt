Nobody is logged in. This is not social <em>login<\/em>, it is social <em>commenting<\/em>. That means it is simple, lean, and whoopingly fast.<\/p>\n<h4>How it works<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Users click the social network icon of their choice when they want to leave a comment.<\/li>\n<li>The social network asks their permission to share their name, profile image, and email address with your site.<\/li>\n<li>If they agree a standard WordPress cookie is added to their browser and the comment form is ready for their reply. When they return to your site they are already authorized. Nice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<p>The usual. Install. Activate. Head for Settings &gt; Postmatic Social Commenting<\/p>\n<p>Like most all social plugins, this thing takes some work to get up and running. We wish it were otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>You must create an app for each network. We&#8217;ve included some fantastic tutorials and videos to help you through the process. It&#8217;s not difficult work, but it&#8217;s not exactly fun. Luckily you only have to do it once and then it&#8217;s high fives from all of your commenters. Forever.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Can my users log in using this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Proudly, no. This isn&#8217;t a heavy weight <em>social everything<\/em> kind of plugin. No users. No logins. No sharing (no sharing!). If you want your users to be able to comment without filling out a name, email, and website this is your plugin is your new best friend. If you want more than that try WordPress Social Login.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Do I have to generate api keys for each network I want to use?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, sorry. You will have to create new apps, configure them, and get keys. We&#8217;ve taken the pain out of it though by including a bunch of videos and tutorials to walk you through it. You&#8217;ll find them on the setting screen for each network.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I customize the social network icons or placement?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You certainly can via css. We don&#8217;t offer any options in the plugin settings yet though. The default style which we have included is simple, elegant, and works well with any theme.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>If a user connects with their social profile can they still subscribe to comments?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Totally. When the user connects with their social network we grab their email address so it can be passed along to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/postmatic\" rel=\"ugc\">Postmatic<\/a>. This is not true of Twitter (which doesn&#8217;t offer email addresses) but if they connect with Twitter and then check the box to subscribe to other comments we&#8217;ll prompt them for their email address.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed stuborn stylesheet from 1.1<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved layout compatability with Epoch<\/li>\n<li>Fontawesome is not loaded unless needed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New layout to play nicely with 4.4<\/li>\n<li>Accessibility and semantic improvements<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a bug in which Postmatic subscriptions would happen by mistake<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a bug in which <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/postmatic\/postmatic-social\/issues\/49\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">email addresses would get funky<\/a> when connecting with Twitter<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a seriously serious bug in which Akismet would get very upset with social comments.
