To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.<\/p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;CartHook for WooCommerce&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you&#8217;ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the the release date, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h4>Manual installation<\/h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application.
