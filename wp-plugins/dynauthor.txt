Ideal for websites that feature multiple authors, where the correct author for a post being added needs to be selected. When a website features hundreds, or even thousands of authors, scrolling through an alphabetised list can take forever.<\/p>\n<p>Dynauthor eliminates that arduous task and makes selecting the desired author as easy as typing their name. The Dynauthor plugin replaces the standard dropdown list selection method for authors with a search box. As you begin to type a name, a list appears of the authors matching that criteria. The list will update with each new character typed.<\/p>\n<p>This is designed for sites with a large selection of authors.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I select the author when I can see it in the list?<\/h3>\n<p>Simply click the author, it will become bold and will fill in the field with that value, then make sure you publish\/update your post.<\/p>\n<h3>Do I have to start with the first letters of the author\u2019s name?<\/h3>\n<p>No, the plugin will search any part of the author\u2019s name. For instance, to find \u2018Steven\u2019, you could start to type \u2018even\u2019 and it will appear in the list of potential matches.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>dynauthor<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you have Author checked in the &#8216;Screen Options&#8217; panel of your post page.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>n\/a<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dynauthor\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2804922\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dynauthor\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2804922\" alt=\"The Dynauthor box in the right sidebar of a post edit screen\"><\/a><p>The Dynauthor box in the right sidebar of a post edit screen<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/dynauthor.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/dynauthor\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2804922","caption":"The Dynauthor box in the right sidebar of a post edit screen"}},"tags":{"author":"author","dynamic-list":"dynamic list"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
