It can be annoying, stressful, frustrating, and a waste of time.  Beyond that, spammy comments can fill up your database and make it a lot bulkier than it needs to be &#8211; particularly if you need to transfer it to a new server.<\/p>\n<p>ClearSpam makes this a lot easier for you by adding a spam counter to the &#8220;Right Now&#8221; box on the dashboard along with a link that lets you instantly and easily purge spammy comments from the database.  The plugin uses WordPress nonce filters, so people won&#8217;t be able to use the plugin to delete legitimate comments.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.<\/p>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>clearspam<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Check the ?Right Now? section of the dashboard for information about spammy comments<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Can this plugin hurt my database?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin has been tested on multiple WordPress installations with various numbers of comments.  However, there is still a possibility that one or more other plugins will interfere with the way it operates.  I would strongly suggest backing up your database before using the plugin just to be safe.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I can&#8217;t see the link you&#8217;re talking about!<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>To prevent your subscribers from having direct access to your database, the only users that can actually see the link are those who have the authority to moderate comments.  I am working under the assumption that, if you trust someone to delete\/publish\/spam comments, you can trust them to delete spam comments as well.  In the future, I might add a separate capability class.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Will this plugin work when I upgrade to WordPress 2.7<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin itself will work, but you won&#8217;t have the same kind of access due to changes in the administration menu.  To correct this, expect a new version of the plugin to be released in November (2008) that will check WordPress versions and change access accordingly.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/clearspam.0.1.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"administration":"administration","comments":"comments","database":"database","purge":"Purge","spam":"spam"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/clearspam.0.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/clearspam.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.jumping-duck.com\/wordpress\/clearspam\/","banners":[]}
