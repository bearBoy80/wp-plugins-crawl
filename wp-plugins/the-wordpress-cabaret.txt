I named this plugin after the &#8220;Cabaret Voltaire&#8221;,<br \/>\nthe nightclub founded by Dadaists in Zurich in 1916. Like futurism, Dada was probably one of the few forms of Art of the past century that could have performed even better using computers, since those artists loved so much random stuff, graphics, fonts and technology in general. This plugin is incomplete for now, and it can&#8217;t do a lot to entertain you. For now it creates random poetry, and clouds out of your posts and comments and spam.<br \/>\nBy no means I have finished developing it: in the work it has visual experiences (!) too.<br \/>\nBut since I am not going to have much time to work on it for the next few months  or so, I decided to release this reduced version of it.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Extract, upload to the plugins folder of your wordpress install, activate.<\/p>\n<p>Go to &#8220;manage&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;The WordPress Cabaret&#8221; and click on the function names.
