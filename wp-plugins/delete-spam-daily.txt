So I setup a cron job on my server that deletes the spam.<\/p>\n<p>Since I had never written a plugin, I thought this might be helpful for those who do not have<br \/>\na dedicated server, shell access to their site, or the knowledge of (or interest in ) cron to set this up.<\/p>\n<p>Spam is not deleted until you start the schedule after the plugin is activated. I created buttons<br \/>\nto start and stop the schedule if you need that layer of control. There is also a button for deleting all spam manually.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>delete-spam-daily<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Look under &#8220;Settings&#8221; &#8211;&gt; &#8220;Delete Spam Daily&#8221; to activate the schedule.<\/li>\n<li>You can start and stop the schedule from the &#8220;Delete Spam Daily&#8221; menu.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>What time does comment spam get deleted?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The first time you start the schedule, spam gets deleted.<br \/>\nSubsequent spam will be scheduled to delete every 24 hours after the first activation.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>If I de-activate this plugin, will it continue to delete spam daily?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The cron job is cleared upon deactivation.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<ul>\n<li>Version 1.0.2 &#8211; 5.28.09: Now optimizes the <code>wp_comments<\/code> table after spam is deleted.
