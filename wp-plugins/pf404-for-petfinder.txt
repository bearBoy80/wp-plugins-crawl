How does it get animals available for adoption?<br \/>\nA. The plugin calls the PetFinder API once a day and collects a list of 18 random animals across the US (of the type you specified in the plugin settings), and stores these in the database.<br \/>\nQ. Is there a way to only show animals from a certain area?<br \/>\nA. Not at this time but this is an enhancement I hope to add in the future.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Installation Instructions<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Install like any other plugin, directly from your plugins page.
