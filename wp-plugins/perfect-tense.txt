But i felt a strong urge to rate this one as it REALLY should not be allowed here. So the plugin needs an API key to connect and this API key you need to purchase and even if you want to do that you will have to submit a form to request a quote. Are you kidding me!!!!!! At least note this in your description before wasting our time and worse bloating our database. Shame on you!!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/perfect-tense.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"grammar":"grammar","proofreading":"proofreading","seo":"seo","spell-check":"spell check","spelling":"spelling"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
