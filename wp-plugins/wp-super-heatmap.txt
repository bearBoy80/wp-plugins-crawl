All of the click-track data is stored locally and the heatmap is also calculated on your own server.  I tried to make the interface as simple as possible and anyone should be able to use this plugin without much trouble.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that this is currently an Alpha release of this plugin and please report any bugs to <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ryan-frankel\/wp_super_heatmap\/issues?sort=created&amp;direction=desc&amp;state=open\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our GitHub repository.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>You can also visit this plugins <a href=\"http:\/\/wp-super-heatmap.swampedpublishing.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">homepage to leave feedback<\/a> and to also get more detailed information about the plugin.  If you have ideas to improve the plugin please leave your comments on that page.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the &#8216;<code>wp_super_heatmap<\/code>&#8216; folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Click on the &#8216;<code>WP Super Heatmap<\/code>&#8216; Menu under the &#8216;Settings&#8217; tab in your WordPress administration area.<\/li>\n<li>Enable click tracking by switching &#8216;<code>Turn Click Tracking On\/Off<\/code>&#8216; to <em>ON<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>Wait anywhere from 1-7 days to track clicks.<\/li>\n<li>Enable the heatmap display buy turning &#8216;<code>Turn Heatmap Display Button On\/Off<\/code>&#8216; to <em>ON<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>While logged in as an administrator you will see a &#8216;<code>Display Heatmap<\/code>&#8216; tab in the front-end.  Simply click this and your heatmap will be calculated.  Please note that if you have a large number of clicks this process may take a few minutes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>How long does it take to process each pages heatmap?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you click on display heatmap the processing time varies depending on how many clicks you have had on your site.  For a few hundred clicks the processing will take a few seconds.  or a few thousand clicks it could take a few minutes.  As with most heatmap tools you don&#8217;t want to run your heatmap for more then about a week to get good results.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I change my websites HTML\/Layout while I am tracking clicks?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since WP Super Heatmap actually uses the structure of your Website to track clicks it is highly <strong>not recommended<\/strong> to modify your HTML\/Layout while tracking clicks.  If you would like to change the structure or layout of your site you should clear the database and start a new heatmap.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.1.0<\/h4>\n<p>Added a fix for target=&#8221;_blank&#8221; not working on links.<\/p>\n<h4>0.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug regarding nested link following.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Aplha release.
