Instead of being loaded at every page view, the gravatar is loaded just once, on the server-side, at the time each new comment is posted.<\/p>\n<p>Gravatar is <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gravatar\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">owned by WordPress<\/a>, and their <a href=\"https:\/\/automattic.com\/privacy\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">privacy policy<\/a> says that they don&#8217;t monetize that info, but hey, corporate policies change, and subpoenas exist.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The user&#8217;s Gravatar profile is saved along with their comment, viewable by admins even if they later change or delete it from gravatar.com.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If someone changes or deletes their Gravatar, your site continues displaying the image that was their Gravatar at the time that they last posted.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If a commenter&#8217;s URL looks like a link to a Mastodon profile, this plugin will attempt to mirror the Mastodon avatar instead.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Additionally: when commenting, a live preview of the Gravatar tracks the contents of the &#8220;Email&#8221; field.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Security and Privacy<\/h3>\n<p>Though WordPress enables Gravatars by default, using them at all might be considered a privacy risk for your blog commenters.  Gravatars expose an MD5 hash of the email address of each commenter, which has been shown to be <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gravatar#Security_concerns_and_data_breaches\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">vulnerable to attacks<\/a>. A sufficiently-motivated attacker can probably translate that MD5 back into an email address.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin does not, at least, make that any worse.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>mirror-gravatar<\/code> directory to your <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure the directory <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/mirror-gravatar\/<\/code> is writable by your web server.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Created<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Also mirrors Mastodon avatar images, if the commenter&#8217;s URL is of the form &#8220;https:\/\/example.com\/@username&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mirror-gravatar\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2740150\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mirror-gravatar\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2740150\" alt=\"A copy of the user&#039;s gravatar.com profile is saved with the comment.\"><\/a><p>A copy of the user's gravatar.com profile is saved with the comment.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mirror-gravatar\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2740150\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mirror-gravatar\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2740150\" alt=\"A live preview of the Gravatar when commenting.\"><\/a><p>A live preview of the Gravatar when commenting.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mirror-gravatar.1.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mirror-gravatar\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2740150","caption":"A copy of the user's gravatar.com profile is saved with the comment."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mirror-gravatar\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2740150","caption":"A live preview of the Gravatar when commenting."}},"tags":{"comments":"comments","gravatar":"gravatar"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mirror-gravatar.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mirror-gravatar.1.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/mirror-gravatar.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
