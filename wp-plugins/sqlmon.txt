SQLMon tries to help the developers and analyzes the query itself, reporting everything that needs attention.<\/p>\n<p>Every query passed to WordPress is analyzed (using EXPLAIN) and the results are shown in the theme&#8217;s footer or Admin panel&#8217;s footer<br \/>\n(they are visible to site administrators only\u00a0\u2014 this allows to use SQLMon even on live sites).<\/p>\n<p>One of the key features of SQLMon is that it can run EXPLAIN not only on SELECT queries but also on UPDATE\/DELETE and INSERT\/REPLACE INTO \u2026 AS or<br \/>\nCREATE TABLE \u2026 AS.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin is perfect for WordPress developers, plugin and theme authors and site administrators who are trying to find out why the blog is too slow.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:<\/strong> the project has moved to <a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.net\/wp-plugin-sqlmon\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Launchpad<\/a>, please use it to report all bugs, suggest improvements,<br \/>\nrequest features and get the latest development version.<\/p>\n<h3>Warning<\/h3>\n<p>This plugins requires that PHP 5 be installed.<br \/>\nNo support for ancient PHP 4, sorry.<\/p>\n<h3>Incompatibilities<\/h3>\n<p>SQLMon is incompatible with plugins that install their own <code>db.php<\/code> into <code>wp-content<\/code> directory (DB Cache, DB Cache Reloaded, probably W3 Total Cache).<\/p>\n<h3>Removal<\/h3>\n<p>If you want to remove the plugin completely, please deactivate it first and make sure that <code>wp-content\/db.php<\/code> is deleted (if not, please delete it yourself).<\/p>\n<h3>Recommended Reading<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/5.1\/en\/using-explain.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Optimizing Queries with EXPLAIN<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Bug Reports<\/h3>\n<p>Please use <a href=\"https:\/\/bugs.launchpad.net\/wp-plugin-sqlmon\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Launchpad<\/a> to report any bugs.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>sqlmon<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory.<\/li>\n<li>Please make sure that <code>wp-content<\/code> directory is writable by your web server (when activated, SQLMon will copy <code>db.php<\/code> to <code>wp-content<\/code>).<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>If everything is fine, you will see <code>db.php<\/code> in your <code>wp-content<\/code> directory.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"<p>None yet.
