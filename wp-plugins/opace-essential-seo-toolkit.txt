The plugin comprises of a suite of third-party external tools, which will help users to analyse, assess and improve the SEO and search engine visibility of their pages, posts or other post types.<\/p>\n<p>The Essential SEO Toolkit is a very powerful suite of tools used by Opace everyday and will be particularly beneficial in roles such as SEO, Web Development and Digital Marketing (as well as many others too). There is no charge for this tool, so why not download it, there is nothing to lose and a lot to gain!<\/p>\n<p>As with any toolkit, there are a range of tools \u2013 each of which when used helps to get a different part of the job done! The tool when opened will use the current URL as its default (this can be changed) and will provide speedy data viewing for the website selected.<\/p>\n<p>In our latest version, we have added some new features. More on this below.<\/p>\n<h3>Admin Settings<\/h3>\n<p>The settings can be modified from the Opace Essential SEO Toolkit plugin installation screen or under &#8220;Settings&#8221; in the admin panel.<br \/>\nThe default landing screen is called &#8220;Sources&#8221;, where you will see all of the default sources added by the plugin.<\/p>\n<p>By scrolling to the bottom, you will see a section called &#8220;Add New Source&#8221; where you can add new sources add your own additional SEO tools to the plugin. In the makeup of the URL, you can use three tags, which will be replaced by the current page&#8217;s URL markup:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>[%scheme%] &#8211; The scheme identifies the protocol to be used to access the resource on the Internet. It can be HTTP (without SSL) or HTTPS (with SSL).<\/li>\n<li>[%host%] &#8211; The host name identifies the host that holds the resource. For example, www.yoursite.com.<\/li>\n<li>[%path%] &#8211; The path identifies the specific resource in the host that the web client wants to access. For example, \/tags\/news\/<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remember to click &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; once you have finished. From here, you can click the &#8220;Categories&#8221; option at the top and add new categories or remove categories as needed.<\/p>\n<p>By clicking the &#8220;Settings&#8221; option, you can select which WordPress post types you would like to use this plugin on. The list here is automatically generated to include the default post types and any custom post types you have created.<\/p>\n<h3>Using the Plugin<\/h3>\n<p>When you have configured the Opace Essential SEO Toolkit settings as needed, you can then go to one of your posts or pages and use the plugin.<\/p>\n<p>In the right hand admin panel of the post type in question you will see the Essential SEO Toolkit meta box. Click on any of your categories to dropdown the list of sources. Click on any source to load it with the current post type URL.<\/p>\n<p>The tools enclosed are divided into five default categories and provide support for numerous areas of social media and SEO.<\/p>\n<h3>SEO &amp;
