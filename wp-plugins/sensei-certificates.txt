You\u2019ve studied hard, taken your test and passed (with flying colours, I\u2019m sure)! After all that effort, you\u2019re finally at the end of the course. You want to share this accolade with everyone. Print out your certificate!<\/p>\n<p>With Sensei LMS Certificates, your students are awarded a certificate for each course they complete through your online school. These certificates can be downloaded, printed and framed on their office wall, or stuck up on the fridge for the entire family to enjoy. If you\u2019d like to make certificates public for all to view, that\u2019s available as well.<\/p>\n<h4>Customise the certificate design<\/h4>\n<p>Sensei LMS Certificates includes an advanced certificate design system. Through this system, you can upload your own background image, place and style the size, typeface and colour of the various pieces of text on the certificate and truly create a unique design best suited to your online school.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t fancy yourself as a designer, or would prefer to get up and running in not much time, Sensei LMS Certificates includes a stylish default certificate design, suited to any genre of online school.<\/p>\n<h4>We already have many students who have completed courses! Can they get certificates as well?<\/h4>\n<p>They certainly can! When activating Sensei LMS Certificates, you will be prompted to generate certificates for each student who has already completed a course. Thankfully, this can be done, for all students, with the click of a button.<\/p>\n<h4>Increase student retention<\/h4>\n<p>We all enjoy receiving rewards. If your students complete a single course, and receive their certificate for the hard work they\u2019ve done, they will be statistically more likely to continue on to a further course, in order to re-live the rewarding experience of receiving a certificate for their efforts.<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing your students light up with excitement when they receive their certificates for all the hard work they\u2019ve done in completing your courses.<\/p>\n<h4>Key Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Easily-customised certificate design<\/li>\n<li>Lean code, to ensure a pleasant experience<\/li>\n<li>Intuitive integration with Sensei LMS<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<h4>Automatic installation<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Log into your WordPress admin panel and go to <em>Plugins<\/em> &gt; <em>Add New<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>Enter &#8220;Sensei LMS Certificates&#8221; into the search field.<\/li>\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve located the plugin, click <em>Install Now<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>Click <em>Activate<\/em>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Manual installation<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it.<\/li>\n<li>Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation&#8217;s <code>wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory on the server.<\/li>\n<li>Log into your WordPress admin panel and activate the plugin from the <em>Plugins<\/em> menu.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/woocommerce\/sensei-certificates\/trunk\/changelog.txt\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See changelog for all versions<\/a>.<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sensei-certificates\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2292662\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sensei-certificates\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2292662\" alt=\"Certificate of completion\"><\/a><p>Certificate of completion<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sensei-certificates\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2292662\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sensei-certificates\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2292662\" alt=\"Customise the certificate design\"><\/a><p>Customise the certificate design<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Abandoned Plugin - Security Risk<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/peterdowney01\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3ecc72fc951bc88139f16d0b016986ce?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3ecc72fc951bc88139f16d0b016986ce?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/peterdowney01\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">PD <small>(peterdowney01)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">March 26, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Sensei team has seemingly abandoned what would correctly be argued as one of their most important features. Frighteningly, they are now ignoring security-related pull requests which are timing out and closing without being pushed. I cannot add links to my review, but you can look this plugin up on Github and view the open and closed pull requests. In fact, this same behavior is seen in other official Sensei plugins such as Sensei Course Progress and Sensei Media Attachments.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would highly recommend steering clear of this plugin and re-evaluating your options when it comes to Sensei as a whole.
