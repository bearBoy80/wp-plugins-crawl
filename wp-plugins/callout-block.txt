Open the modal with the icons, go to the &#8220;Custom SVG&#8221; tab and insert your SVG string or a link (the extension must end with <code>.svg<\/code>).

Transform your callout box to a reusable block as usual. Then, if you want to use it later in a post or page, insert it from the reusable blocks section.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to edit the content for the reusable block, you have to transform your block to a regular block. If you don&#8217;t do that, the callout box will be updated across your website (unless if that&#8217;s what you want it).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<p>This version is only compatible with WP 6.2 or higher.
