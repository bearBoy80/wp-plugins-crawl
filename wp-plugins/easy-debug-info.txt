And yes, I am also aware that it&#8217;s not a good practice to create a plugin that doesn&#8217;t stick to this requirements. Easy Debug Info requires PHP 5.3 or above anyways. There are two main reasons for this decision:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security<\/strong>: PHP 5.2 was released back in November 2006 and was maintained and updated until January 2011. This means that it\u2019s now considered an old release that\u2019s no longer supported. Should a new vulnerability be discovered in PHP 5.2, it will remain unfixed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Features<\/strong>: PHP 5.3 adds a lot of new features and transforms PHP into a more modern language supporting closures, anonymous functions, namespace, etc. I don&#8217;t want to miss these features while developing a plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.2.0<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Enhancements<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Scheduled Events reports<\/li>\n<li>Developers may register their own reporters<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>** Further Notes**<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated language files: en_US &amp; de_DE<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Enhancements<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Environment &amp; Database reports<\/li>\n<li>Extended General report  to include WordPress specific constants<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<p>This is the first stable release for internal use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Remarks:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not listed in the wp.org plugin directory, yet<\/li>\n<li>Limited data collection possibilities<\/li>\n<li>Made for internal use<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/easy-debug-info\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=978477\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/easy-debug-info\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=978477\" alt=\"Visiting the &quot;Easy Debug Info&quot; backend page for the first time.\"><\/a><p>Visiting the \"Easy Debug Info\" backend page for the first time.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/easy-debug-info\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=978477\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/easy-debug-info\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=978477\" alt=\"Showing a previously generated report.\"><\/a><p>Showing a previously generated report.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/easy-debug-info.1.2.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/easy-debug-info\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=978477","caption":"Visiting the \"Easy Debug Info\" backend page for the first time."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/easy-debug-info\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=978477","caption":"Showing a previously generated report."}},"tags":{"constants":"Constants","database":"database","debug":"debug","debugging":"debugging","statistics":"statistics"},"versions":{"1.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/easy-debug-info.1.1.0.zip","1.2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/easy-debug-info.1.2.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/easy-debug-info.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=V8PNBN3D3MRYU","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/easy-debug-info\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=978477","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/easy-debug-info\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=978477"}}
