It allows theme developers to rely on WordPress&#8217; own image resizing functionality using <code>add_image_size<\/code> and <code>get_the_post_thumbnail<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>When get_the_post_thumbnail is called, Secure Image Resizer checks if the requested image size exists. If the image doesn&#8217;t exist it dynamically creates the resized version. It works in the background, with no front end functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Theme developers can either bundle this plugin into their themes, or suggest that their users install it.<\/p>\n<p>It also includes 2 functions <code>so_resize_custom<\/code> and <code>so_resize_custom_html<\/code> to do dynamic image resizing using Imagick. Great for theme developers.<\/p>\n<p>Please Note: This is an early release of Secure Image Resizer. Please use it, try and break it and report any bugs to me support@siteorigin.com so I can quickly fix them and work towards version 1.0.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>This is a standard WordPress plugin.
