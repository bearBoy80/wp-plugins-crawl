However, it was quite useful to see if I would like to progress further with the plugin.\n\nMy steps then were:\n\t<li>Start analyser with my URL<\/li>\n\t<li>Got a 64% improvement potential<\/li>\n\t<li>Signed up<\/li>\n\t<li>Got a preview site which looked like my site<\/li>\n<em>Actually pretty nice to see if the plugin breaks someting. I got so many problems with other plugins that this time I was surprised that I can test before. Definetly a BONUS<\/em>\n\t<li>Preview Site looked good and was functional<\/li>\n<em>now it got really interesting<\/em>\n\t<li>Went full mode on - enabled ALL the features<\/li>\n\t<li>Tested the preview site again<\/li>\n<em>Ready to go - until here I spent 12 minutes<\/em>\n\t<li>Ended the preview mode - it\u00b4s one click<\/li>\n\t<li>Got a lot of errors on the wao.io dashboard<\/li>\n\t<li>CHanged the DNS settings (as it was advised on the dashboard)<\/li>\n\t<li>Saw all the warnings turn green<\/li>\n<em>Got an email that my website is going to be optimised now<em>\n\t<li>Success<\/li>\n\n\nWell, I got to say the DNS change was quite a hustle but in the end, I just had to copy&amp;paste two numbers.\n\nMy website is definitely faster and I tripled my Google PageSpeed score. On webpagetest.org the results are looking even better. However, had to wait 2-3 days to see the web performance results change. \n\nThe security part was instantly improved! \n\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">useful cloud-based web performance optimization<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/openmindculture\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/38135ffca342b815f27dda84599fc18b?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/38135ffca342b815f27dda84599fc18b?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/openmindculture\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Ingo Steinke (openmindculture) <small>(openmindculture)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 4, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">WordPress sites often tend to load slowly, especially after adding more plugins.
