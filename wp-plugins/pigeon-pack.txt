You have full control and ownership over your email lists, campaigns, autoresponders, and more. Due to this, you are also required to follow the SPAM laws, guidelines and recommendations for your country. The plugin is setup to meet compliance with current laws, however, you have the responsibility to know the laws and make sure you are using the plugin appropriately. For more information about the SPAM laws in your country, see the list below or google &#8220;SPAM LAWS&#8221; for your country.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Email Sending Limits<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every web host and SMTP provider has limits on the numbers of messages that can be sent from their systems. Please check with your web host or SMTP provider to verify their email limit policy. This is important to ensure you setup the plugin properly to prevent your customers from missing emails. If you anticipate sending large amount of email campaigns, there are services out there that you can use with Pigeon Pack, such as Amazon&#8217;s Simple Email Service (SES). Amazon SES lets you send bulk and transactional email to customers in a quick and cost-effective manner.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What are the minimum requirements for Pigeon pack?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 3.4 or later<\/li>\n<li>PHP 5<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How is Pigeon pack Licensed?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pigeon Pack is GPL<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.3.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing column sort for campaign type column<\/li>\n<li>Modifying pre_user_query function<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding column sortability on campaign type column<\/li>\n<li>Ading check to make sure old campaigns exist before trying to send mail<\/li>\n<li>Adding check to ensure a single user doesn&#8217;t get sent multiples of the same email <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updating WP_Widget for deprecated use in WP4.3<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.12<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with HTML entities not displaying properly in email subjects<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.11<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing method call for profile update<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.10<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing typo in SMTP Authentication setting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding ability to use the Post&#8217;s Featured Image in a campaign<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding espa\u00f1ol language files, thanks to Andrew from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webhostinghub.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Web Hosting Hub<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding i18n support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Moving actions<\/li>\n<li>Fixed bug with multiple publishing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Pigeon mascot<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup better multi-part MIME support<\/li>\n<li>Fixed typo in campaign save<\/li>\n<li>Adding proper HTML error codes to wp_die statements<\/li>\n<li>Fixed error in calling static method in shortcodes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>General typo and code fixes<\/li>\n<li>Fixed update return variable<\/li>\n<li>Fixed bug in adding new subscribers AJAX<\/li>\n<li>Updating Pigeon Pack icon and Special Thanks<\/li>\n<li>Redux of the hash functions<\/li>\n<li>Change priority of script enqueues and default to in_footer when possible<\/li>\n<li>Fixing tag lines<\/li>\n<li>Undefined variable error in widgets<\/li>\n<li>Updating Help Page and CSS, fixing misnamed functions<\/li>\n<li>Updated {{MERGE}} tag helpers<\/li>\n<li>Removing unused code<\/li>\n<li>More robust post status transition checking<\/li>\n<li>Do not add trash =&gt;
