It is simple, easy-to-use, and intuitive.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Features<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accessible only from the WordPress Dashboard, allowing it to be used on either internally- or externally-facing WordPress instances.<\/li>\n<li>Displays classes by: Upcoming, Incomplete, Previous and My Classes<\/li>\n<li>Customizable fields for Department, Class Location, Class Type and Audience.<\/li>\n<li>Customizable flags (i.e. &#8220;Do any students have disabilities or special requirements?&#8221; &#8220;Is this a First Year Experience class?&#8221;)<\/li>\n<li>Ability to duplicate classes for multiple sessions.<\/li>\n<li>Statistical reports can be narrowed by date range or primary librarian.

For example, removing the class location &#8220;Classroom 1&#8221; from the fields page will not remove it from classes that exist with &#8220;Classroom 1&#8221; selected as the class location, it will just not be available as a choice for new classes. This is the same for all fields on the fields page.<\/p>\n<h3>Requirements<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>JavaScript must be enabled in order for some of the functionality to work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the library-instruction-recorder directory to the plugins folder.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin on the plugins section of the dashboard.<\/li>\n<li>Add fields for the Library Instruction Recorder by going to LIR -&gt; Fields (must be an administrator).<\/li>\n<li>Adjust any additional settings by going to LIR -&gt; Settings (must be an administrator).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Why did you make this when there are so many other tools out there?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Library Instruction Recorder is specifically designed to be simple, without a lot of the features often found in larger and more complex resource scheduling tools.  By reducing unnecessary features, librarians are able to quickly record sessions and get statistical reports easily.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What about resource scheduling? Or .ics files? Or attaching instructional materials? Or making me a cup of coffee?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Right now there are no plans for major enhancements to LIR.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How\/Where should I report problems?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can submit issue tickets to our <a href=\"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/gsulibwebmaster\/library-instruction-recorder\/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Bitbucket issue tracker<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>No longer sets PHP timezone, uses WordPress current_time function instead.<\/li>\n<li>Updated table creation for posts table, now last_updated is updated on an update (ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP).<\/li>\n<li>Alters posts table to be in line with the above.<\/li>\n<li>Strips extra slashes that WordPress adds to POST\/GET\/&amp;c. variables (this was causing extra slashes to be added in front of single quotes).<\/li>\n<li>Escaped a lot of fields that were not already escaped.<\/li>\n<li>Report downloads in Firefox are fixed (removed spaces from file name).<\/li>\n<li>Copying a class now allows all fields to be edited before being submitted.<\/li>\n<li>Added an option to disable email reminders.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Doesn&#8217;t look for WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN flag in the uninstall method now.<\/li>\n<li>Activation, deactivation, and uninstall hooks now reference the class name instead of &#8216;this&#8217;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a TON of undefined index errors!<\/li>\n<li>Removed some unnecessary code related to report downloading.<\/li>\n<li>Changed a few deprecated WordPress functions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>CSV headers were not being sent before data in some instances of report generation causing reports to not download.
