Instead of going through massive blocks of data on a webpage, screen readers can Skip to content feature, users can move from the top of the page to another different section of the website.<\/li>\n<li>Add outline focus for focusable elements: Many WordPress website is designed without considering keyboard dependent users.

This is where the WORDPRESS ACCESSIBILITY plugin shines in the creation of easily accessible sites.<\/li>\n<li>Add landmark roles to all links: one of WordPress\u2019 common trends, is to show an excerpt of a post with hyperlinks that\u2019ll let you read the full content. These links are usually represented with plain boring text. Which makes it difficult for users to differentiate between the excerpted contents that those links represent. By default, WordPress links are excerpted with words like \u201ccontinue reading\u201d, \u201cmore\u201d or an equivalent text. This can pose a lot of problem with your site\u2019s accessibility. However, With our WORDPRESS ACCESSIBILITY plugin on your dash, you can add titles to all your links.

Our Plugin allows you to rectify these issues with its topnotch style customizer tool.<br \/>\n*Enable alt attributes on images: Similar to how WordPress adds title attributes to all the links it generates on your website, featured images have title automatic attributes as well.
