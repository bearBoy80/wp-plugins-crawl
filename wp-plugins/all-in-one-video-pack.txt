For instance, to create remixes or mash-ups, video artists need access to the original materials in order to reformulate their new work. In an ideal world, everyday users will be able to easily copy and paste portions of video, as they already can with text. Of course the benefits of a more open system will go far beyond remixing, cutting, and pasting &#8211; when open video standards and formats are widely embraced, it will be possible to index, search, and access the medium much as we do text. This will be the real revolution for video.<\/p>\n<p>Kaltura is a founding member of the Open Video Alliance, a group of organizations, developers, creators, and academics all striving to foster the open-source online video revolution.  We invite the entire community to join us in building the first open-source platform for interactive and collaborative video.

This plug-in is just plain broken - and no one at Kaltura will answer anything here - or on their own support pages, for that matter. If you PAY Kaltura for their services, MAYBE they'd be interested in helping you. Open source? That's just a joke.<\/p>\n<p>Want to have a Kaltura-hosted video play in Wordpress? Well, this plug in works a bit - you can actually get a Kaltura video to play in your WP site, but it won't play nicely with any other video content you might want to post that's hosted anywhere else. You can't style the presentation much, and the thumbnail feature is broken.<\/p>\n<p>Also, the Kaltura plug's iteration of their proprietary video player inserts a half-dozen spammy Kaltura links to their own video products. Oh yeah, and the plug-in's controls that allegedly disable comments don't work, either. You could probably fix all of this by going into the plug's code, but I don't think that's much of a practical solution.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this plug's Support section - not much there, and nothing recent, either.

There are so many things wring with this update, it's hard to know where to start. SO i'll give a typical scenerio.<\/p>\n<p>Installing:<br \/>\nThere is absolutely NO documentation for configuring the \" settings.ini\" file. The default values are horribly wrong in most cases. If you have CE5, you'll need to change ALL the ID numbers. Every last one. PERIOD!<br \/>\nAlas, the intellectual giants that developed this monstrosity fail to even HINT at where these magic Conf ID's come from. With kaltura's default install, you'll have more than 100 UI Conf ID's listed. Good luck guessing the correct one.<\/p>\n<p>If you are using CE5, get ready to feel the pain. Once you've managed to get the conf id's correct, you're still out of luck. The editor-side selection of videos will actually work. However, once added to your post, the player itself will not be visible on the live page. Just a big fat blank NOTHING where the video player SHOULD be.<\/p>\n<p>CE6, you'll have it a little better, once it's properly set up, you MIGHT be able to see the videos in your page. <\/p>\n<p>Updating from Previos version (2.4.4 i believe) Will present a nightmare.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike EVERY DECENT PLUGIN for wordpress. This one adds a table  to the database (for the widget), as well as adds about 6 - 8 entries into the wordpress options table. Seems legit, however, if you uninstall the plugin. It doesn't remove these settings. Which means when you reinstall, yer borked, if you update, you're borked. <\/p>\n<p>you will need to MANUALLY remove these from the database. YAY Sql fans! Boo anyone without proper knowledge. You may inadvertently #! the entire site.<\/p>\n<p>Now we move onto a more geek oriented subject. <\/p>\n<p>IT'S SLOW!! It's like trying to race a turtle if your a snail. A single video on your main page will bog the entire page down waiting for the player to load all the data. YAY DERPS!<\/p>\n<p>It's SHODDY CODE!<br \/>\nTurn on debugging, and enjoy the spectacle. several errors with the php code itself. The code isn't nececerily bad, just many outdated strings. Using functions improperly, and not sanity checking code to prevent blank-page-of-doom is bad. Trap your errors silly.<\/p>\n<p>So... as a recap, and possible solutions:<br \/>\na) Installation:<br \/>\nAdd a readme file that ISN'T 4 - 6 years old and default from version 1.0 of the script \/ kaltura.<\/p>\n<p>b) Upgrade:<br \/>\nCreate an uninstall script to remove the entries made by plugin in the wp_options table. also, remove the table created by the widget portion of the plugin.<\/p>\n<p>c) Performance:<br \/>\nInstead of calling on Kaltura for every bit of information, preemptively upload thumbnail, and any other static yet small data points to a temp directory within the plugin, or an addition directory within the wp-content structure. Slimline some of the scripts, or data actually accessed to speed up page loading. i.e. You don't need to gather ALL data in an array, then later strip 99% of it out. clean it up.<\/p>\n<p>D) Performance 2:<br \/>\nUpdate your syntax and coding practices. If you're coding for php v1.4.2 you'll have problems with depreciated functions, and syntax if the plugin is run on php v5.x. Should probably repackage the plugin with several flavors for diferent PHP versions. I'm not saying make 300 versions. but just the one's needed. i.e. php 4.x 5.x etc...\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.7.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/all-in-one-video-pack\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1567371","caption":"Blog main page with video posts"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/all-in-one-video-pack\/trunk\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1567371","caption":"Add Video Screen"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/all-in-one-video-pack\/trunk\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=1567371","caption":"Entries Library"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/all-in-one-video-pack\/trunk\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=1567371","caption":"The plugin settings page"}},"tags":{"admin":"admin","advertising":"advertising","audio":"audio","camera":"camera","collaboration":"collaboration"},"versions":{"2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.0.zip","2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.1.zip","2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.2.zip","2.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.3.zip","2.3.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.3.1.zip","2.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.4.zip","2.4.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.4.1.zip","2.4.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.4.2.zip","2.4.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.4.3.zip","2.4.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.4.4.zip","2.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.5.zip","2.5.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.5.1.zip","2.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.2.7.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/all-in-one-video-pack.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
