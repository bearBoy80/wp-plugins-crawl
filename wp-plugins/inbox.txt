I hate leaving WordPress to check or send email for the site I am on. This plugin looked like an excellent solution. \n\nThis is a good start and does function somewhat but it does not work well enough to be sold on Envato or given away on WP.org in my opinion. \n\nYou can only add 7 total email addresses with the paid version which is not mentioned anywhere in the documentation of which there is effectively none. \n\nI was never able to get the cron job working despite a considerable knowledge of working with cron jobs. I\u2019m not sure that feature actually functions. \n\nI emailed support and despite paying for support never heard back from them. It has been 5 days since I emailed them so they had plenty of time to reply. \n\nEmails are displayed with extraneous code showing and subject lines have the same issue. You cannot delete an email while viewing it. There is no way to archive an email and remove it from the inbox. So inbox zero is not possible and your inbox stays full and confusing. Attachments are also confusing and poorly designed much like the rest of the plugin. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t buy this plugin, the free version does everything the paid version does. All you get for the $20 is 6 extra email accounts and no support.\n\nFinally, to the WordPress Plugin Repository folks. Why are you letting plugin authors make reviews of their own plugins? This is misleading and wrong. Stop it.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">nice<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/roghithsam\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0965f23a43bb31574a79fcafbddb0849?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0965f23a43bb31574a79fcafbddb0849?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/roghithsam\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">roghithsam<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 4, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I find a plugin like this in a long time.\n\nThanks for the very nice plugin!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">It&#039;s a well tested working plugin<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/fahadmahmood\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/84ca71035e61fa6425bb0d3e4588237f?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/84ca71035e61fa6425bb0d3e4588237f?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/fahadmahmood\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Fahad Mahmood <small>(fahadmahmood)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">January 11, 2019<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I am happy to release this masterpiece for you all.
