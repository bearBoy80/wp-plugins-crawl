It?s at its heart an affiliate system set up for the general user instead of companies combining crowd sourcing into the standard affiliate model.<\/p>\n<p>The way Coin of the realm works is by generating unique links to all of the pages and post on a WordPress sight for each Registered user.  When that user uses the link to reference the sight on some other website every reader who click on the link generates a referral in the COTR system.  COTR converts referrals into coins that the registered user can use to buy things in the automatically generated store page.<\/p>\n<p>Coin of the realm supports 3 types of reward products; digital downloads, comment badges, and donation drives.  These products are quick to create in the store interface and can be purchased with either referral generated coins or with regular currency.  COTR support both the paypal and verotel payment gateways for making purchases.<\/p>\n<p>For more information visit the COTR message board.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/community.910cmx.com\/index.php?\/forum\/148-wordpress-coin-of-the-realm\/\" title=\"Coin of the Realm Message Board\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Message Board<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Notes:<\/h3>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The referral worth will not update until you save the page<\/li>\n<li>COTR use ip addresses to prevent multiple ?referals? from a single user.  While this prevents abuse it does make the system rather stingy when giving out coins. <\/li>\n<li>Changing the number of referals needed to earn one coin will not change the amount of coins a user has already earned.  It is best to set the Referral IP Coin Value once and then modify the coin cost of individual products as needed.<\/li>\n<li>Psychologically user respond better to the system when it is easy to earn coins and they can see themselves making progress towards a goal.   It is recommended to set the Referral IP Coin Value low at 1 or 2.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Ad Hoc Purchase Settings<\/p>\n<p>The Ad Hoc Purchase Settings allow user to buy products with cash instead of coins earned through referals.  Filling out this section transforms the COTR store into a traditional shopping cart system on top of the affliate system set up by the coins.  While these setting are optional it?s generally useful to fill out some of them to earn money as well as referrals through the COTR.<br \/>\nIf you do not fill out these fields the associated buy now buttons for the payment gateway will not apear on the page.  COTR allows for two payment gateway system.  Paypal for sites with general content and Verotel for site with mature content.  While both payment gateways can be active on the same site it is unusual to have both Paypal and Verotel running at the same time.<\/p>\n<h3>Note:<\/h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At this time there is no way to pick and chose by product what payment gateways are available these are global setting for all products.<br \/>\n  * Verotel set up requires integrating with your Verotel account.  It is best that you contact your rep to walk you through the process.<br \/>\n  * To accept payment through paypal complete the following steps.<br \/>\n  1. Enter in your Paypal log in email in the Paypal handel.<br \/>\n  1. Type in the 3 digit currency code for the currency you will be using.  You can find a list of all the code paypal uses here:<br \/>\n  https:\/\/cms.paypal.com\/us\/cgi-bin\/?cmd=_render-content&#038;content_ID=developer\/e_howto_api_nvp_currency_codes<br \/>\n  1.

The general setting establish what the value of one ?coin? in in terms of referals and cash.  It also determines what features of Coin of the real you want to use.

This value can be any positive whole number greater than 0.<\/li>\n<li>Set the Coin Cash value. This can be any positive whole or decimal number that represents the conversion rate for coins into real money when the coin is donated in a donation product.  Number greater than 1 mean a coin is worth more than a single dollar (or whatever currency you are using) and conversely decimals less than 1 have the coin worth only cents on the dollar.<\/li>\n<li>The Disable Badges drop down should be left to the default of No unless you experience errors on your comment pages after installing COTR.  On some custom Templates the badge system has interfeared with the commenting process this drop down is added to deactivate badges in that case.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","faq":"<p>No we don?t know.
