A specific Google API key is required (available free from Google &#8211; follow link on setup page) and is stored within you WordPress site. This key is sent to the Google servers to allow access to the Map object that is rendered in the users browser overlaid with your route and marker data as desired.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Spot (Find Me Spot) servers for download of GPS tracking and message data via the API interface provided by Spot LLC (http:\/\/www.findmespot.com). A user specific Spot share page GLID is stored within your WordPress site and is used to retrieve relevant information from the Spot severs via WordPress\\&#8217; built in external HTTP functionality. No other data is sent to external servers. Received GPS data is validated and stored locally within your website database for display, backup and future use as desired.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<p>v1.4.3 &#8211; First public release<br \/>\nv1.4.4 &#8211; Bug fix, php warning in remote API call script<br \/>\nv1.4.5 &#8211; Code cleanup, unused marker table removed<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mactrak\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1746402\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mactrak\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1746402\" alt=\"MacTrak Admin main screen as used on www.ChasingTheSunrise.org\/tracker\"><\/a><p>MacTrak Admin main screen as used on www.ChasingTheSunrise.org\/tracker<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great Plugin.<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/peergum\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3649ec8dac694d11d01ead97ee6805e6?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3649ec8dac694d11d01ead97ee6805e6?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/peergum\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">PeerGum <small>(peergum)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 21, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">The plug-in does well what's expected from it.\n\nI wish a few more options were available, like choosing between road\/sat map, maybe filtering positions inside a certain perimeter (e.g. to not show a particular location within a city, but rather average all positions within 5km)...\n\nAlso being able to edit points or lines (to change the color, for instance) would be great.\n\nGood job, in any case!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Available on the directory unlike the other option<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/shaunmccance\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6ca3624e077948ceeecb0e6fd10cda52?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6ca3624e077948ceeecb0e6fd10cda52?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/shaunmccance\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">ShaunMc <small>(shaunmccance)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 15, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I coded this to comply with he WordPress guidelines so that my site would not be open to vulnerabilities using an unverified plugin as is available.
