You learn the value of this grabber e.g. when you need to move your old non-WordPress site with many pictures to the WordPress-based.<br \/>\nThe plugin recognizes images by the presence (jpg|jpeg|gif|png) in URLs.<\/p>\n<p>If you like this plugin please vote for it.<\/p>\n<p>Please feel free to contact me with your questions or suggestions.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>remote-images-grabber<\/code> folder to the plugins directory, usually <code>wp-content\/plugins<\/code> (or use the native wordpress plugin installation interface).<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress, then &#8216;Images Grabber&#8217; link in the Mediafiles submenu and &#8216;Images Grabber&#8217; tab in a post editor upload box appear.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Installation Instructions<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>remote-images-grabber<\/code> folder to the plugins directory, usually <code>wp-content\/plugins<\/code> (or use the native wordpress plugin installation interface).<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress, then &#8216;Images Grabber&#8217; link in the Mediafiles submenu and &#8216;Images Grabber&#8217; tab in a post editor upload box appear.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How can I grab images in case they are represented with relative path (no http: in SRC or HREF) in HTML?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Fill in the Base URL field. Sample: to grab http:\/\/example.com\/some-dir\/files\/my-image.png which is described as &lt;img src=&#8221;files\/my-image.png&#8221; on http:\/\/example.com\/some-dir\/some-page.html you should add http:\/\/example.com\/some-dir\/ into the Base URL field.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I enter an URL of a page that has pictures but the plugin grab nothing.<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Look through HTML of that page, maybe it is a case described above.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How to use the plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the &#8216;Images Grabber&#8217; page in your wordpress admin panel, specify the post ID where images should be attached to (if such post doesn&#8217;t exist, images stay unattached), paste the list of images URLs you wish to grab (separated by spaces or one link by line) or simply paste a piece of html-code, and push &#8216;Go!&#8217; button. That&#8217;s all! Or, instead of the above, you may put into the next text field an URL of a web page that links to images.<\/li>\n<li>The 2nd way is to select &#8216;Images Grabber&#8217; tab in an upload box, then grabbed images are being attached to the currently edited post automatically. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I recommend to use <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Gallery_Shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><code>[gallery]<\/code><\/a> or other gallery shortcode in the post where you attach images, then they will appear in the post automatically.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin has no options but one can specify some parameters before running grabber script: minimum and maximum file size, grab images from <code>&lt;img src=<\/code> and <code>&lt;a href=<\/code> html-tags or only URLs listed as plain text, and base URL for images presented as relative paths.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>more changes in recognizing image URLs (thanks to Thomas who reported a bug);<\/li>\n<li>base URL field value is kept in cookies now and filled in automatically until you change it or close your browser.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.5.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>added: recognition of square brackets [] in image URLs;<\/li>\n<li>added: autofill of base URL field.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.5.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>fixed: php notice when WP_DEBUG is on<\/li>\n<li>added: https requests replaced with http <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.5.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>fixed bugs: ignoring image URLs containing &#8220;+&#8221; character and error on long urlencoded file names.
