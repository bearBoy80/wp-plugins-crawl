The message contains a list of the form fields with the errors, a description of the error and a link to the field.<\/li>\n<li>Adds aria-describedby attributes for date and website fields &#8211; providing clear instructions for screen reader users of what format is required for the field.<\/li>\n<li>Adds aria-describedby attributes for fields that have failed validation &#8211; providing clear instructions for screen reader users of what the field error is. Description used is the default validation message for the field, or if set, the validation message for the field.<\/li>\n<li>Disables the Gravity Forms configured tabindex &#8211; this stops users from being able to tab between fields and on-page links.<\/li>\n<li>Changes links in the form body, such as field descriptions or HTML fields, so they open in a new window. A title is added or appended to any existing title for screen reader users which reads &#8216;this link will open in a new window&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>Improved file upload field &#8211; wrapped in field set, clearly identifies to screen reader users if any file size of file type restrictions have been set of the field.<\/li>\n<li>Improved field instructions &#8211; if a description has been provided for the field, the field is &#8216;described by&#8217; the description, using the aria-describedby attribute<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See a demo of this plugin at <a href=\"http:\/\/demo.itsupportguides.com\/gravity-forms-wcag-20-form-fields\/\" title=\"demo website\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">demo.itsupportguides.com\/gravity-forms-wcag-20-form-fields<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>How to I use the plugin?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Simply install and activate the plugin &#8211; no configuration required.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have a suggestion, comment or request?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Please leave a detailed message on the support tab.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let me know what you think<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Please take the time to review the plugin.

However when it comes to forms there is reason enough to do this &#8211; if the user clicks on the link they are taken away from the form &#8211; loosing any data they may have provided.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin uses jQuery to modify the form once the browser has loaded it, any links in the form are changed to open in a new window (target=&#8217;_blank&#8217;), then a title is added (or appended to the existing title) which reads &#8216;this link will open in a new window&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>This is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/WCAG20-TECHS\/H33.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">H33: Supplementing link text with the title attribute<\/a> technique.<\/p>\n<p>Why not use the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/2014\/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140916\/C7\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">C7: Using CSS to hide a portion of the link text<\/a> technique?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m concerned it would have a negative consequence on SEO, because:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search engines may down-rate your website, thinking you&#8217;re attempting the black hat practice of stuffing a page with keywords that may not have any relevance to the content. <\/li>\n<li>Search engines may index the links with the hidden text. For example, &#8216;document title this link will open in a new window&#8217; instead of &#8216;document title&#8217;.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I&#8217;m willing to be convinced otherwise. But my goal is to make a Gravity Form accessible for everyone &#8211; which needs to take into account how it affects search engines.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How is the plugin tested<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is tested using screen-reader software JAWS and the latest version of Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin is developed using the latest version of Gravity Forms. The plugin may work in previous versions but could have mixed results. Only the latest version of Gravity Forms can be supported.<\/p>\n<p>The aim of the plugin is to make forms created using Gravity Forms have valid HTML and comply with WCAG 2.0 &#8211; level AA.<\/p>\n<p>Each change the plugin makes to a Gravity Form has been decided through research into best practice for usability and accessibility.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I disable the tabindex on the validation message<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>I DO NOT recommend removing the tabindex.<\/p>\n<p>After considered research I am of the belief that tabindex with a value of =-1 is perfectly fine, and infact quite helpful in making critical messages such as a validation message appear immidately for screen reader users.<\/p>\n<p>With that said, if you want to disable it you can add this code to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file, below the starting &lt;?php line.<\/p>\n<pre><code>add_action('itsg_gf_wcag_disable_tabindex', function () {\n    return true;\n});\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.7.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: resolve conflict with Gravity Forms 2.4.7 &#8220;Added accessibility enhancements&#8221;.

Nothing to configure or set up.\n\n<strong>If you're on the fence, don't be. Just pull the plug, don't think about it. You're wasting your time. It works.<\/strong>\n\nA HUGE THANK YOU to the developers.
