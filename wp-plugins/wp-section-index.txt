This list is also aimed at providing the user with a list of headings, explaining what the Page or blog Post is about.<\/p>\n<p>If you enjoy writing long blog posts, but fear that your users won&#8217;t read through the entire post due to it&#8217;s length, fear no more. WP Section Index will make reading those long blog posts that much easier for your users.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Installing WP Section Index is really easily.

The plugin looks through your content and creates easy-to-navigate-to sections within the content. This is ideal for long Pages or blog Posts.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>The section index isn&#8217;t displaying. What gives?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the widget is not visible on the Page or Post, the section index will not display. By the same token, if the widget is enabled and there are no sections for the Page or Post in question (or the section index has been disabled for that Page or Post) the widget displaying the section index will not display.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s this about a &#8220;Back to top&#8221; element ID?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is the ID of an element (a <code>div<\/code> tag, for example) in your theme to which you would like the user to jump when a &#8220;Back to top&#8221; link is clicked. It is recommended that this element be somewhere near the top of the screen, usually a <code>header<\/code> or <code>top<\/code> element. The ID can be found by viewing the source of the page and looking for a tag with the <code>id=\"\"<\/code> attribute. The value inside the quotation marks is what is inputted in the <code>\"Back to top\" element ID<\/code> field.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug with section index not displaying on non-paginated Pages and Posts, when &#8220;display all anchors&#8221; is active.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added functionality to toggle the display of all section index anchors in the widget when on a paginated Post or Page.<\/li>\n<li>Added support for removing the &#8220;back to top ID&#8221;, such that the page jumps to the top instead of to a specific element ID.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusted versioning structure to work as &#8220;Major Release&#8221;.&#8221;New Feature&#8221;.&#8221;Bug Fix&#8221;.
