Allows you to recursivly install\/update composer packages inside of all of your WordPress plugins and themes.<\/p>\n<h3>What is this using?<\/h3>\n<p>This package uses a great piece of software called <a href=\"http:\/\/wp-cli.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP-CLI<\/a>. It provides a command line interface for WordPress management. We are a plugin providing Composer management inside of WP CLI.<\/p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s Composer?<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s the greatest thing to happen to the web since GIFs, Drop Shadows and dancing cats. Composer is a dead simple JSON-based dependency manager for PHP.

Sadly, I&#8217;m building this out and I&#8217;m trying to make some sweet WP-CLI and Composer integration.

You just create a simple <code>composer.json<\/code> file like you would with any Composer project. From there, wp-composer will interface with each plugin\/theme that has composer support and it will generate the autoload files, too!<\/p>\n<p>Just include something like this inside your main plugin file:<\/p>\n<pre><code>require(__DIR__.'\/vendor\/autoload.php');\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>It&#8217;s that simple.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>\/composer\/<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Interface with it via wp-cli!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>What is WP CLI?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP-CLI is a set of command-line tools for managing WordPress installations.
