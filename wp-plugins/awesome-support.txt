I was a loyal customer for more than a year and literally bought everything they sell. The product was \"ok\" at best and they were always fairly slow, in my opinion, in tackling bugs and customer support tickets. Our needs changed and we no longer needed internal support so we moved away from the product. Inadvertently we allowed the licenses we had to auto-renew but within a few days we caught it and explained the situation and asked for a refund. Instead of seeing that we made a simple mistake (missed the cancel date by only a few days) and were not using the product any longer (not installed), they refused to give us a refund and kept about $800 in fees. Wow, they must be hurting for cash or just have black hearts to value the money more than the goodwill of an otherwise faithful client. I would not encourage even an enemy to do business with this company. The product is just \"ok\" but the service is terrible. Run and find a better company. We had a much better client experience with Support Candy before coming to Awesome Support. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great Support Plugin<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/wiredwhite\/\"><img alt='' src='http:\/\/2.gravatar.com\/avatar\/bb8cbf57367ff14dc17b1d215606b260?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='http:\/\/2.gravatar.com\/avatar\/bb8cbf57367ff14dc17b1d215606b260?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/wiredwhite\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">wiredwhite<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 6, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's great and nice looking plugin for support tickets.
