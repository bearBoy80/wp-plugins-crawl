I was really worried as I know there are new laws about accessibility on websites and making sure your website is available to all. I wanted to make sure anyone can access, read and enjoy my website as well as the services I offer. I was a bit worried about the installation because I don't have any computer skills but the set up was really quick and not too complicated and anyone can do it. I think it's really important for everyone to instal this. And it feels really good to include absolutely everyone on the web.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/equalweb.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/equalweb\/assets\/screenshot-1.JPG?rev=2505893","caption":"Equalweb Registration page"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/equalweb\/assets\/screenshot-2.JPG?rev=2505893","caption":"Add your website at Equalweb.com"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/equalweb\/assets\/screenshot-3.JPG?rev=2505893","caption":"Design and customize your accessibility icon"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/equalweb\/assets\/screenshot-4.JPG?rev=2505893","caption":"Example view of the code provided by EqualWeb"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/equalweb\/assets\/screenshot-5.JPG?rev=2505893","caption":"Accessibility monitor setup"},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/equalweb\/assets\/screenshot-6.JPG?rev=2505893","caption":"Accessibility report by equalweb monitor"}},"tags":{"accessibility":"accessibility","digital-accessibility":"digital accessibility","wcag":"wcag","web-accessibility":"web accessibility","website-accessibility":"website accessibility"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.equalweb.com\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/equalweb\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2508838","high":false}}
