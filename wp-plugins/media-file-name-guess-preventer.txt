If not all of the content on your site is public, this can be a problem as people can snoop on your media folder by guessing file names.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin prepends a short 8 character hash to the beginning of every uploaded file. For example, DKIM1004.jpg turns into 8df8078e-DKIM1004.jpg. The hash is not cryptographically secure and just makes it a bit more difficult to guess file names.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin works on all upload file types and all sizes of a given image get the same prefix.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload plugin folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/media-file-name-guess-preventer.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"uploads":"uploads"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/media-file-name-guess-preventer.1.0.0.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
