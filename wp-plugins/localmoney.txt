LocalMoney relies<br \/>\non the WP-cron system to fetch and cache the rates from<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/openexchangerates.org\" title=\"The openexchangerates.org site\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Open Exchange Rates<\/a><br \/>\non an hourly basis and then uses javascript to lookup the visitor&#8217;s location and<br \/>\nfetch the appropriate rate data. This means that, unlike some plugins I could mention,<br \/>\nLocalMoney is compatible with caching plugins.<\/p>\n<p>LocalMoney, once configured, immediately (or as soon as your cache updates) acts<br \/>\non all your posts and pages without you having to mark up the prices in your text.<\/p>\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Determines the reader&#8217;s country via IP address, using IP2C<\/li>\n<li>Resolves proxies with the &#8216;forwarded-for&#8217; header so AOL-compatible<\/li>\n<li>If IP2C fails uses the language settings and timezone offset to guess location<\/li>\n<li>Obtains exchange rates from openexchangerates.org<\/li>\n<li>Uses AJAX so that converting currency values doesn&#8217;t delay page load times<\/li>\n<li>Caches exchange rates locally to minimize calls to openexchangerates.org<\/li>\n<li>Output prices matched to format of input prices (i.e. with or without cents)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>How to Use<\/h4>\n<p>Once LocalMoney is installed it will take any page on which US dollar prices are<br \/>\ndisplayed and convert them to the visitors local currency. If your posts are written<br \/>\nwith another currency you can change the base currency in the Settings &gt; LocalMoney<br \/>\npage.<\/p>\n<h3>Internationalization (i18n)<\/h3>\n<p>Currently LocalMoney has not been translated to any languages other than English.<\/p>\n<p>If you wish, feel free to create a translation.

If the user is accessing your site via a proxy the &#8216;Forwarded-for&#8217; header<br \/>\nwill be used, allowing users from AOL to benefit from this plugin.<\/p>\n<p>The fallback system looks at the visitor&#8217;s language preference. If it is in the form &#8216;en-GB&#8217; it will<br \/>\nuse the appropriate currency for GB which is Pound Sterling. If the language preference<br \/>\nis in the form &#8216;en&#8217; it will check the timezone offset of the user and guess the<br \/>\nappropriate country from that, i.e. in the case of &#8216;en&#8217; the following data will be<br \/>\nused:<\/p>\n<p>0 &#8211; 24-&gt;<\/p>\n<p>gb gb gb gb gb in in ch au au au au nz nz us us us us us us gb gb gb gb<\/p>\n<p>Under the fallback system, because the currency is determined by the settings on<br \/>\nthe user&#8217;s machine, a visitor who happens to be in a foreign country still gets<br \/>\ntheir own currency not the local one (unless they have changed their timezone settings).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.5 2013-10-14<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug that prevented currency updates in some circumstances.<\/li>\n<li>Removed rounding in initial content parse to increase overall accuracy of conversion.<\/li>\n<li>Converter now removes any blocks of three digits prefixed by a &#8216;.&#8217; or &#8216;,&#8217; to remove all thousands separators.<\/li>\n<li>Added facility for converter to handle currencies where a decimal comma is used.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.4 2013-09-12<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensured compatibility with WordPress 3.6.1 and updated documentation accordingly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.3 2013-06-21<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed all occurrences of &#8216;<strong>DIR<\/strong>&#8216; with &#8216;dirname(<strong>FILE<\/strong>)&#8217; in order to be backward-compatible<br \/>\nwith PHP installations prior to 5.3.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.2 2013-05-26<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the javascript conversion from working if the WordPress<br \/>\ninstallation was not in the domain root.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1 2013-04-28<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Corrected miscellaneous bugs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0 2013-03-17<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Base currency selector added to admin page.<\/li>\n<li>Code added to handle non-US Dollar currencies as base.<\/li>\n<li>New fancy banner designed for WordPress hosting page.<\/li>\n<li>GPL_V2 now included as part of plugin<\/li>\n<li>Various miscellaneous revisions to the readme.txt<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.0 2013-03-06<\/h4>\n<p>Development version!<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/localmoney\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=678088\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/localmoney\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=678088\" alt=\"The LocalMoney settings page.\"><\/a><p>The LocalMoney settings page.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/localmoney\/assets\/screenshot-2.gif?rev=678088\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/localmoney\/assets\/screenshot-2.gif?rev=678088\" alt=\"LocalMoney in action -- exciting isn&#039;t it!\"><\/a><p>LocalMoney in action -- exciting isn't it!<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/localmoney.1.0.6.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/localmoney\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=678088","caption":"The LocalMoney settings page."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/localmoney\/assets\/screenshot-2.gif?rev=678088","caption":"LocalMoney in action -- exciting isn't it!"}},"tags":{"cache":"cache","converter":"converter","currency":"currency","currency-rates":"currency rates","prices":"prices"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/localmoney.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/localmoney.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/localmoney.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/localmoney.1.0.3.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/localmoney.1.0.4.zip","1.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/localmoney.1.0.5.zip","1.0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/localmoney.1.0.6.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/localmoney.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=steve@machinesthatgobing.com","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/localmoney\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=678444","high":false}}
