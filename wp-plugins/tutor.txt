I love this!<br \/><br \/>Re BuddyBoss intergration: the design of Tutor LMS is impressive and fits well into the BuddyBoss Platform. Also, you can easily write some custom functions, for example you can integrate this into the groups functions with ease, so that only students who are enrolled into the group see connected courses - the others don't.<br \/><br \/>Also, imho Tutor gives more value for money, and they also have a great set of functions even in their free version. This makes Tutor LMS an oustanding option for your learning experience in WordPress.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Try it out and see yourself, or opt into the
