The data can then be presented within posts\/pages through the use of short-codes added to the editor in text-mode. The data is fetched through javascript AJAX calls, and stored within the browser as a cookie for caching purposes.<br \/>\nCurrently the plugin uses the public <code>DEMO_KEY<\/code> for requests towards the open API, and as mentioned then stores the data as cookies for the next 24 hours, this to lessen the request load on the API and also possibly help the wordpress user to a smoother experience.<\/p>\n<p>How to use:<br \/>\nAfter activating the plugin, go to your post\/page, go to editor mode, and then either add <code>[astronomy-picture-of-the-day]<\/code> or <code>[astronomy-picture-of-the-day-hd]<\/code> to generate a html block consisting of a container div, with a title, the apod image and its explanation.<br \/>\nAll elements receive css classes so they can be styled independently by the WordPress developer.<br \/>\nWithin the admin interface the specific <code>css<\/code> classes that gets added are mentioned.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/astronomy-picture-of-the-day<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Use the Settings-&gt;Astronomy Picture Of the Day screen to configure the plugin<\/li>\n<li>The plugin basically lets you use the short-codes <code>astronomy-picture-of-the-day<\/code> or <code>astronomy-picture-of-the-day-hd<\/code> to get a <code>div<\/code> container with an image element, a header with the corresponding title and a paragraph with the explanation to the APOD.<\/li>\n<li>In the admin interface page, there is a button that clears the browser cache from previously stored  data.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor adjustments with readme.txt, images added to assets dir so plugin will show images on WordPress.org<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/astronomy-picture-of-the-day\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1595615\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/astronomy-picture-of-the-day\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1595615\" alt=\"This shows the admin interface of the plugin.\"><\/a><p>This shows the admin interface of the plugin.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/astronomy-picture-of-the-day\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1595615\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/astronomy-picture-of-the-day\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1595615\" alt=\"This shows an example of how to add the shortcode that will generate the html block, in the text-editor mode.
