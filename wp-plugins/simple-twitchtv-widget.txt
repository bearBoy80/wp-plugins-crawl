It is a very<br \/>\nstraight-forward, easy to use, and configurable front-end widget generator.<br \/>\nThe entirety of what the widget does, is show if a user is online or not. If the<br \/>\nuser in question is online, it will give a preview of their stream and a link<br \/>\nto their stream. If they are offline, it will simply place a placeholder image<br \/>\nthere.<\/p>\n<h3>Support<\/h3>\n<p>I will provide ZERO support for this plugin.
