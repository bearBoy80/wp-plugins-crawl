She has gone way above and beyond and, in spite of us being so needy for so much help, she is extremely patient! On top of everything, she has again went above and beyond by taking a look at our site and giving us some seriously valuable feedback and suggestions. We, at NRG Pulse, could not be happier with all of the assistance she has given and look forward to continuing working with her...as long as we are not too annoying for her!!! Thanks so much Krystal! - Ivan &amp; Lisa at NRG Pulse<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/multi-step-forms-free-for-elementor.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/multi-step-forms-free-for-elementor\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2250783","caption":"View of the Multi-step Forms FREE (for Elementor) widget in action."}},"tags":{"drag-and-drop":"drag-and-drop","editor":"editor","elementor":"elementor","landing-page":"landing page","page-builder":"page builder"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"https:\/\/teklovers.com","banners":[]}
