The administrator can toggle between allowing and disallowing this benefit with a single click. The change is instant and does not require a page reload, making the moderation of external links a breeze.<\/p>\n<h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>When logged in as an administrator, green \u201ctick\u201d and red \u201cstop\u201d icons appear next to all external links in a post indicating whether <code>rel=\"nofollow\"<\/code> is currently applied to them. Simply click an icon to toggle between these two states and alter the link&#8217;s nofollow status. This change is applied to your database remotely, without requiring a page reload.<\/p>\n<h3>Why is this plugin useful?<\/h3>\n<p>The whole question of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seowizz.net\/2009\/04\/relnofollow-debate-lets-try-and-get-to.html\" title=\"The rel=nofollow debate: Let\u2019s Try and Get To Grips With It\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">whether to use <code>rel=\"nofollow\"<\/code><\/a> is a hotly debated one, and applying it (or not) across the board is not a good solution. You want to give credit where it is due and reward useful websites but, at the same time, you do not want to reward suspect websites that promote unethical or unscrupulous behaviour. Read more about how <a href=\"http:\/\/skeptools.wordpress.com\/2008\/09\/03\/not-just-for-spam-anymore-nofollow-for-skepticism\/\" title=\"Not just for spam anymore: NOFOLLOW for skepticism \u00ab Skeptical Software Tools\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><code>nofollow<\/code> is extremely important<\/a> when engaging in activism.<\/p>\n<p>If you are not the sole author of your website or blog it can be very difficult to stay on top of which links are being followed. NoFollowr allows you to easily spot and alter which links receive your love, without spending time going back and forth between your site and the admin area to edit the posts manually.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>The easiest way to install NoFollowr is to do so from within your site&#8217;s admin area:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search for it from your admin plugin page and click \u201cInstall Now\u201d<\/li>\n<li>From the resulting installation page, wait until you see the \u201cActivate Plugin\u201d link, then click it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Otherwise, the installation process is as follows:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download NoFollowr<\/li>\n<li>Expand the zip archive and copy the entire folder named &#8220;nofollowr&#8221; to the \/wp-content\/plugins\/ folder within your WordPress installation<\/li>\n<li>Login to the admin area of your site and go to the plugins section<\/li>\n<li>Find NoFollowr in the list and click its \u201cActivate\u201d link.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>NoFollowr is now fully operational and requires no further setup.
