The first instalment (25%) is processed immediately and the merchant ships your purchase to you as normal, so you can enjoy now and pay later.<\/p>\n<p>The remaining three instalments are due every two weeks thereafter. Absolutely no interest and zero fees are charged as-long-as all repayments are processed successfully on time. So in short, at the end of the six weeks you only pay for what you ordered!<\/p>\n<p>We benefit most when our customers complete instalments early and so if you want to pay off your instalments early, you can do so at absolutely no extra cost.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about Postpay please go to https:\/\/postpay.io.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Please note, this payment gateway requires WooCommerce 3.0 and above.<\/p>\n<h4>Automatic installation<\/h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don\u2019t need to leave your web browser.
