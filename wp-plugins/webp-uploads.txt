WebP images will be generated only for new uploads, pre-existing imagery will not be converted to WebP format. By default, WebP images will only be generated for JPEG uploads, only the original uploaded file will still exist as a JPEG image. All generated image sizes will exist as WebP only. If you wish to change this behaviour, there is a checkbox in <code>Settings &gt; Media<\/code> that &#8211; when checked &#8211; will alter the behaviour of this plugin to generate both JPEG and WebP images for every sub-size (noting again that this will only affect newly uploaded images, i.e. after making said change).<\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>Installation from within WordPress<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Search for <strong>WebP Uploads<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Install and activate the <strong>WebP Uploads<\/strong> plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Manual installation<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>webp-uploads<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory.<\/li>\n<li>Visit <strong>Plugins<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the <strong>WebP Uploads<\/strong> plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20submit%20my%20plugin%20feedback%3F'>\nWhere can I submit my plugin feedback?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Feedback is encouraged and much appreciated, especially since this plugin may contain future WordPress core features.

Why?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two primary reasons that a WebP image may not be generated:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The WebP Uploads plugin has identified that the WebP version of the uploaded JPEG image would have a larger file size than the original JPEG image, so it does not generate the WebP version.<\/li>\n<li>The JPEG image was not uploaded to the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.com\/support\/media\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Media Library<\/a>. At this time, WebP versions are only generated for images to the Media Library. WebP versions are not generated for JPEG images that are added to your site in other ways, such as in a template file or the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.com\/support\/customizer\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Customizer<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='with%20the%20webp%20uploads%20plugin%20activated%2C%20will%20the%20plugin%20generate%20jpeg%20and%20webp%20versions%20of%20every%20image%20that%20i%20upload%3F'>\nWith the WebP Uploads plugin activated, will the plugin generate JPEG and WebP versions of every image that I upload?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, the WebP Uploads plugin will only generate WebP versions of the images that you upload.
