WC 3.0+ compliant<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WC Map Guest Orders and Downloads does exactly what the title says. We&#8217;ve all had customers order something from our site, and then later decide to create an account. Especially with downloadable products, this can cause an issue where logged in users can&#8217;t view their past orders or downloads. We address this here by checking the billing e-mail address on past guest orders when an account is created or a user logs in, and if it matches the e-mail set on the user account, the appropriate orders and downloads are mapped to the new account.<\/p>\n<p>This is a simple little plugin, with no settings, no options, just install, activate, and go!<\/p>\n<p>To see other plugins like this, or tips on how these are built, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.dandulaney.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Dependencies and Liscencing<\/h3>\n<p>Depends on WooCommerce<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/wc-map-guest-orders-and-downloads<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>What do I need for this plugin to run?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need the WooCommerce plugin.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I set up \/ configure this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing to configure!
