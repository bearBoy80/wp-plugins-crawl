If the author is being rude or disrespectful, it will encourage them to think twice, and give them a chance to rephrase their comment to be more kind before they submit it.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.perspectiveapi.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Perspective API<\/a> is used to determine the characteristics of the comment, which means that all comments will be sent to their servers for analysis.
