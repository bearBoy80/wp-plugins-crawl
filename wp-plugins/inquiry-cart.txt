Just use simple shortcodes to add a product to the inquiry cart, and place a shortcode in any page to allow the user to send an email to any person about those products.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you have just done a project and you want people to be able to ask you about it or if you would like to do it for them, they can just add that to the inquiry cart.<\/p>\n<p>If you do custom or unique work that can&#8217;t be mass-produced and shipped in a box, you can&#8217;t use a shopping cart plugin.  Make a post about each kind of work you do and allow your viewers to ask for similar work.<\/p>\n<p>The shortcodes you need to use to add items to the inquiry cart can be placed by your right in your blog posts or pages.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Copy the plugin folder into your <em>plugins<\/em> directory, and then use the WordPress administration interface to activate the plugin.<\/p>\n<p>When this is done, edit the settings in the &#8216;Inquiry cart&#8217; submenu in the &#8216;Settings&#8217; menu, and you are done.<\/p>\n<p>The shortcodes you need to use are listed right in this submenu.<\/p>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/inquiry-cart.20121110.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"cart":"cart","inquiry-cart":"inquiry cart"},"versions":{"20121110":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/inquiry-cart.20121110.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/inquiry-cart.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
