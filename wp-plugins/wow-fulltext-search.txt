Search pages traffic may even affect whole website stability by taking all SQL server resources.<br \/>\nThat happens because WordPress use SQL queries to perform the search but MySQL is not designed for that. There is only one working solution to prevent search slowness &#8211; use specially designed Search Engine server software written exactly for that purpose, and this plugin allows you to do that.<br \/>\nThis plugin supports ElasticSearch engine to perform search requests, and our service available in every hosting environment.<br \/>\nKeep in mind that some technical knowledge required to set up and maintain ElasticSearch server software, also it&#8217;s not possible to install it on every hosting environment so we do offer our Managed service available for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>While we offer our search solutions to our customers for awhile with a lot of success, we decided to publish some basic solution to the community for free since we use a lot of open-source tools in our work too.
