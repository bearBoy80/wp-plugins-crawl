Only the admin account was able to connect to remove the plugin and enable the users back in. That's not how people is going to pay for it, instead you got a perfect way to get removed from potential consumers.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Doesn&#039;t Work With Cache Plugins<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/consultant1027\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/cbe7b1d45b3dbb3f28314272f75cddf7?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/cbe7b1d45b3dbb3f28314272f75cddf7?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/consultant1027\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">consultant1027<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 28, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Initially this plugin processes the request after a cache plugin so if you are running a cache plugin, blocked IPs will still get served the page by the cache.\n\nI got a message this has been fixed.

And this was only after some weeks of using IPQualityScore.\n\nThe gamebreaker, however, is the woocomerce support. Not many pluggings can offer something similar.
