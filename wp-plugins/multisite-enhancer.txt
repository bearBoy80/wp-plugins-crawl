Therefore, I developed this plugin on my own.\n\nIt helps me in keeping track of how many posts are published across the WP network of sites without visiting the dashboard of each.\nIt also allows to open the external links in child window, which keeps the site visible in background without sending\/throwing\/shooting off the user. This helps users too who wants to browse the site further after visiting the external page.\n\nSorting by posts count do no work yet. I will fix that part as soon as possible.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/multisite-enhancer.0.3.2.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/multisite-enhancer\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2149914","caption":"Network Dashboard &gt; Right Now (Section | Widget) &gt; Total Posts across network of Sites"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/multisite-enhancer\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2149914","caption":"Network Dashboard &gt; Sites &gt; All Sites &gt; Posts Count"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/multisite-enhancer\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2149914","caption":"Network Dashboard &gt; Plugin Settings Page"}},"tags":{"ms":"ms","multisite":"multisite","posts":"posts","wpmu":"wpmu"},"versions":{"0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/multisite-enhancer.0.2.zip","0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/multisite-enhancer.0.3.zip","0.3.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/multisite-enhancer.0.3.1.zip","0.3.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/multisite-enhancer.0.3.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/multisite-enhancer.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/paypal.me\/shrikrishnameena","banners":[]}
