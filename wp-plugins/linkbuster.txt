For instance, Genesis Responsive Slider is awesome, but sometimes I don&#8217;t want the links to be active. I just want to show the slider content. LinkBuster will allow you to specify a CSS Path (a div class or ID, etc) and will replace all the hrefs with # so they links are effectively disabled.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin creates a widget. That widget can be placed in any widget area. Multiple LinkBuster widgets can be used to disable links in separate CSS paths.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Use Firebug or similar tool to identify the CSS Path that contains the links you want to disable.<\/li>\n<li>Drag the LinkBuster widget to a widget area, and enter that CSS Path.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/linkbuster.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"css":"css","link":"link"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
