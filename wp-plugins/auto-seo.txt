It will generate new meta tags, replacing any old ones your theme may add already, that are fully customized to target the audience you want. Don&#8217;t want to override everything? No problem, you choose what to override and on what post types to do it. Take the tedium out of SEO.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note: because Auto SEO is designed to override existing meta tags when needed it works a bit differently than other SEO plugins and as such may not work on every theme. While it has been tested with a wide variety of different themes naturally it would be impossible to test them all. If your having trouble getting it to active on your site I&#8217;m more than willing to help, just let me know what theme your using and I&#8217;ll take a look, contact information inside the plugin.<\/em><\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>auto-seo<\/code> directory to your <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory.<\/li>\n<li>Active the plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Go to the new \u201cAuto SEO\u201d settings page and review\/adjust the settings and keywords as desired.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The settings page has notes on their functions and should be self explanatory, but here are the highlights.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Active Post Types<\/strong> determines where Auto SEO inserts\/replaces meta data.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keyword Sets<\/strong> lets you define sets of keywords to be automagically inserted into the description where you want them, also shows the pool from which meta keywords and chosen.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Meta Tag Options<\/strong> let you control what tags are enabled, and set up new title tags, meta descriptions, and the number of keywords as well as override the robots if desired.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Can I translate this plugin into the language of my choice?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
