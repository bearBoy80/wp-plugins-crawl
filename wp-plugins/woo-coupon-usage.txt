These codes not only track sales for commission purposes but also offer customers immediate discounts or special offers, enriching the purchasing experience. However, the Coupon Affiliates system still maintains the flexibility of referral links; affiliates can share URLs that automatically apply their coupon at checkout, and even if a coupon isnt used, you can still make the link alone track referrals, ensuring affiliates receive credit for every sale referred\u200b\u200b.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20there%20be%20more%20features%20added%20in%20the%20future%3F'>\nWill there be more features added in the future?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!
