All this happens thanks to the tools created by Textile.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin has a module called &#8220;Static Site Generator&#8221;. With this feature any wordpress admin can create a static copy of their posts and upload it directly to IPFS in just a few clicks. You can chose between making a shallow copy or a deep copy.<\/p>\n<p>A shallow copy only will backup your html post data, maybe not very interesting but useful if your post have only text and no other media.<\/p>\n<p>A deep copy will try to backup all the images and videos present in the post. Very powerful.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin has a lot of other modules. For example we have a Bucket explorer if you want to browse your files or upload new ones directly to your buckets.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we inclue a BETA functionality to upload your buckets to Filecoin mainnet. This is a very handy tool.<\/p>\n<p>Go beyond the limits imposed by your hosting provider.

You can visit the Textile docs if you want to know more about how to use their tools: https:\/\/docs.textile.io\/tutorials\/hub\/web-app\/<\/p>\n<p>So with Typescript we import the Textile libraries needed to create for example Buckets.<\/p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to know how to programm to use this tools.
