For example, if you were to digress from a topic in your post, you can type out an annote and allow the viewers to stay in synch of your topic but at the same time see what extra (and sometimes unneeded) information you added. If you have any annotes in your post, the text will also be added at the end of your post.<\/p>\n<p>Format:<br \/>\n    [annotate=&#8221;<em>hover_over_text<\/em>&#8221; show=&#8221;<em>text_seen_in_post<\/em>&#8220;]<em>full_description_of_annote<\/em>[\/annotate]<br \/>\n    [annote=&#8221;<em>hover_over_text<\/em>&#8221; show=&#8221;<em>text_seen_in_post<\/em>&#8220;]<\/p>\n<p>The <em>hover_over_text<\/em> is REQUIRED!
