However you came across the roadblock of expenses for the site you create on. You realized that you can't just afford to do it on the side, let alone expand to be full time.\n\nUhmi is the type of tool that lets you create a micro pay wall to put your content behind. Not only can it create paywall posts, but it can allow your followers buy all sorts of content.\n\nVideos, posts, pdfs, downloadables etc. Not to mention the subscription aspect behind the tool.\n\nAllowing you to have your own version of Patreon on your own site, and it is more in depth that other plugins like Paid Memberships. You can really get into that ever expanding micro content space. If you to even sell something for a penny you can.\n\nNot to mention the Uhmi plugin does a lot more than the patreon plugin, which is already a win.\n\nI am super excited to see what comes with it in the future! #FTW #polypro<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/uhmi.1.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/uhmi\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2085586","caption":"The Uhmi widget."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/uhmi\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2191656","caption":"Fill in your payment details."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/uhmi\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2191656","caption":"Customize the Uhmi button."}},"tags":{"content":"content","micro-payments":"micro-payments","micropayments":"micropayments","microtransactions":"microtransactions","monetize":"monetize"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/uhmi.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/uhmi.1.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/uhmi.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/uhmi\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2191656","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/uhmi\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2191656"}}
