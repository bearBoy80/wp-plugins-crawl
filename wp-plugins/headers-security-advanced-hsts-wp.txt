This means that nothing can call document.interestCohort() to get the FLoC ID of the currently used client.

It hardly makes you look at settings, although it can leave some features and options desirable - but that's hardly a big concern for me at the very least.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On another note - Pagespeed Insights is reporting that the use of the Permission-policy header: WindowPlacementPermissionPolicyParsed is deprecated and shouldn't be used.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It also gave the following feedback -<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>script-src directive is missing.
