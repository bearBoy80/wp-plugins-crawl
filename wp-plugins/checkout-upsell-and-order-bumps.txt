These offers work by analyzing past customer purchases and using that data to suggest complementary products.<\/p>\n<p>When customers see items that complement their current selection, they are often more likely to add those items to their purchase. This increases the average order value and, subsequently, total sales.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of &#8220;Frequently Bought Together&#8221; offers could be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A laptop, a laptop case, and a wireless mouse.<\/li>\n<li>A novel, a bookmark, and a book light.<\/li>\n<li>A barbecue grill, grilling tools, and barbecue sauce.<\/li>\n<li>A yoga mat, yoga blocks, and a yoga mat cleaner.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cart Upsell &#8211; Displayed at the cart page<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Cart Upsells feature is a powerful tool designed to increase the average order value by recommending complementary or higher value products to customers at the crucial point of checkout.<br \/>\nLeveraging the principles of behavioral psychology, the plugin analyzes a customer&#8217;s cart content in real-time and suggests related products that the customer might also be interested in.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if a customer is purchasing a digital camera, the plugin might suggest buying an extra memory card, a carrying case, or even a higher-end camera that includes additional features.<br \/>\nIt could even be a simple &#8220;Gift wrap&#8221; add-on as an upsell.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of &#8220;Cart Upsell&#8221; offers could be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Gift Wrap add-on<\/li>\n<li>When customer purchases a T-shirt, recommend matching accessories such as jewelry, shoes, or a handbag.<\/li>\n<li>When a customer buying a moisturizer, recommend a related face cleanser from the same brand or a sunscreen that complements the skincare routine.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Double the order &#8211; Displayed at the checkout page<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Double the Order&#8221; feature acts as an effective strategy to boost sales by encouraging customers to double their current order with just one click, often with a discount.<br \/>\nIt can be a game-changer in situations where customers often buy items in multiple quantities or when the products have a usage cycle, leading to eventual re-purchases (like food items, cosmetics, household supplies, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>Once customers finalize their cart and proceed to checkout, the plugin shows a banner offering them a chance to double their order at a percentage off or for a special price. This option can be highly appealing for consumers looking for a bargain, and it encourages a larger purchase in a way that feels like an exclusive opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>It is a one-click upsell offer in WooCommerce.

Not only did I purchase the premium version, but I can confidently state that it was one of the wisest purchases I've ever made.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">First and foremost, the plugin works flawlessly. Unlike other premium plugins I've tried in the past, which often caused issues and crashed my CPU, this plugin has been impeccable. It hasn't caused any issues with my site and offers flexibility and customization that I've never seen before.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">But what truly struck me was the customer service. I sent an email to the support team asking for an additional feature. Not only did they respond in record time, but within just 24 hours they provided me with a modified version of the plugin that included exactly what I had requested. It's rare to find a company that listens so closely to its customers' needs and acts so swiftly.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">My request was quite specific: I wanted to have the same option I had in a certain campaign for the \"Frequently bought together\" campaign as well. Not only did they understand perfectly what I wanted, but they also provided clear instructions on how to implement the new feature, complete with screenshots to facilitate the process.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">In conclusion, if you're looking for a WooCommerce plugin that not only works great but is also backed by an exceptional team of professionals, look no further. \"Checkout Upsell - WooCommerce Upsell, Cross Sell, Order Bumps, One Click Upsell, Next Order Coupons, Product Recommendations\" is the one for you. After 10 years of working with WordPress, I can say with certainty that this is one of the best plugins I've ever used. Kudos to the team for their commitment and dedication in providing a top-quality product and service!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">5 STARS &amp; COULD GIVE MORE<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/d36ca4i1l\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/455e6c3f0687c36bba33782b7835405a?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/455e6c3f0687c36bba33782b7835405a?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/d36ca4i1l\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">d36ca4i1l<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 22, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Fantastic plugin!
