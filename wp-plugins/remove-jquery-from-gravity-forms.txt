Obiously we would like to avoid a full reload on submission, but also not include JQuery in this day and age where vanilla JavaScript is so capable.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin makes use of the built-in REST API in Gravity Forms, and uses that to submit the form and perform validation. File uploads and multi-page forms are supported.<\/p>\n<p>By only using vanilla JavaScript, this plugin is 1.5kB (v1.1 minified and gzipped), compared to the 31kB of jQuery (3.6.1 minified and gzipped). A 95% reduction in size!<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Make sure Gravity Forms is installed and activated.<\/li>\n<li>Enable the REST API in Gravity Forms settings.<\/li>\n<li>Install and activate this plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='will%20this%20break%20my%20site%3F'>\nWill this break my site?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin removes jQuery from the front-end, and other plugins dependent on that may face issues.
