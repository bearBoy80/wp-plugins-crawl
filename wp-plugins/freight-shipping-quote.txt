We also activated this plugin for use with international shipments, but not specifically for freight shipments.  Our cart displays live rates for USPS and UPS for Int'l shipments, but this may not always be the best option for a specific country.  So by letting our international customers request an alternative shipping quote for their specific order to their specific country, we can provide a customized shipping quote that often beats the live rates. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">As stated in the review title, with a few tweaks this plugin would be great.  But it is very good as it is.  We hope the developer will maintain and improve this plugin! <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/freight-shipping-quote.1.0.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/freight-shipping-quote\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=3001980","caption":""},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/freight-shipping-quote\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=3001980","caption":""},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/freight-shipping-quote\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=3001980","caption":""},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/freight-shipping-quote\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=3001980","caption":""}},"tags":{"custom-shipping":"custom shipping","freight-shipping":"freight shipping","request-shipping-quote":"request shipping quote","shipping-quote":"shipping quote","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/freight-shipping-quote.1.0.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/freight-shipping-quote.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/freight-shipping-quote\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=3001982","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/freight-shipping-quote\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=3001982"}}
