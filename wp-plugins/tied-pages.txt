With this WordPress plugin you can create multiple pages and by tying them together you only have to edit the master page once in order to apply changes to all of them.<\/p>\n<p>Tie a page to another one through a simple dropdown menu. The chosen page will then be the master. Changes made to the master page are automatically applied to all the pages tied to it. If a page is a tied page its content or title can\u2019t be changed unless you untie it. You can enter a different title for a tied page.
