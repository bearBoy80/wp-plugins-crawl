This is a very fine method for using Zombaio with wordpress.  The only reason I <strong>didn't<\/strong> give it 5 stars because I feel it could use a few updates\/expansions that were addressed in the support section over a year ago but haven't been implemented.  Mainly giving access to RSS feed page and category pages.\n\nWouldn't have been able to create my site without it because I knew I wanted to use wordpress and don't know enough programming to get my theme working the way I wanted without it. Kudos Barry!\n\n<strong>PS - I found a solution!!!!<\/strong>  To get the RSS feed and category pages to display without being redirected\n\nI added the following code in the wp_zombaio.php starting around line 1284 file right before:\n\n<pre><code>else {\n    $redirect = true;\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\nI added the lines:\n\n<pre><code>else if (is_feed() || is_category()) {\n    if (get_the_ID() != $target) {\n        $redirect = false;\n    }\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\nNow that section of code looks like:\n\n<pre><code>            \/\/ valid target?\n            if ($target) {\n                \/\/ dev hook is page excluded?\n                if (is_home() &amp;&amp; !$this-&gt;options-&gt;redirect_home_page) {\n                    $target = false;\n                } else if (is_singular() || is_single() || is_page()) {\n                    $meta = get_post_meta(get_the_ID(), &#039;wp_zombaio_redirect_disable&#039;, true);\n                    if ($meta == &#039;1&#039;) {\n                        $target = false;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                if ($target) {\n                    if ($target === true) {\n                        $redirect = true;\n                    } else if (is_singular() || is_single() || is_page()) {\n                        if (get_the_ID() != $target) {\n                            $redirect = true;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    \n                    else if (is_feed() || is_category()) {\n                        if (get_the_ID() != $target) {\n                            $redirect = false;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    \n                     else {\n                        $redirect = true;\n                    }\n\n                    if ($redirect) {\n                        header(&#039;Location: &#039; . $target_url);\n                        exit;\n                    }\n                }\n            }<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\nIf you need to allow access to certain categories and not others, you should be able to use the WP syntax for conditional tags found here: https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Conditional_Tags<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Horrible!!!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jp-hunter\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/5e18bae1e750322b61c9523e86061ba4?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/5e18bae1e750322b61c9523e86061ba4?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jp-hunter\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">JP Hunter<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 8, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>Honestly, the plugin is okay at best but Zombaio's service is horrible and please do yourself a favor by going to someone else and spend the $1000 on Visa and MC fees. Zombaio is 5 months behind on payouts and is very difficult to contact nor do they respond promptly if at all. Their USA addresses listed on their official site are FAKE and they DO NOT HAVE ANY USA OFFICES!!!  The same guy named Jesper appears to be the only guy who works for Zombaio. Anytime he doesn't work, they become closed because its a religious holiday. Please do not take my word for this and do 5 minutes of research to verify they are bullshit. Do a reverse address search on their listed address in Mountain View, CA. It is a Regus building. Call the Regus office and they will tell you they have no one listed under their name or their mother companies name. The suite number listed is the Regus office and has never been used for anything else. Their New York address is a condemned apartment. Their real office is apparently in Sweden. Anyways, back out now if you can and go with anyone else other than Zombaio. They owe lots of people thousands of dollars!! A simple \"problems with zombaio\" search on google should also provide enough links stating the same. Zombaio also sent me this email and said they would be caught up by July. They have not.<\/p>\n<p>Zombaio Settlements - Date: 2014-05-23<\/p>\n<p>Dear Zombaio Client,<\/p>\n<p>As I am sure you have noticed, we have been experiencing more problems than usual in paying out on time recently and many people have speculated (as they have done for years) that we are on the verge of going out of business.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst we understand that many of you have lost money when other processors have gone out of business in the past, and that you understandably get nervous when payments are late, we want to assure you that our problems are temporary and a knock on effect of issues our main acquirer had with their USD settlement and exchange bank which meant that their settlements to us were quite significantly delayed.<\/p>\n<p>We tried to keep things going as best as we could from our reserves during this period, but this caught us a little unaware, and it has taken time for us to straighten things out which I am pleased to say that we now have and we should be able to bring everybody''s settlements fully up to date during the course of next months.<\/p>\n<p>We will however need to make changes ongoing if we are to avoid falling back in this hole. When we first came to the market we tried to give both the best rates and the fastest payouts and we now know that unless you have a much greater share of the market than we do, and a faster settlement than our acquirers are able to give us, this is quite an impossible model to sustain.<\/p>\n<p>Consequently, we have decided to stop trying to be the cheapest AND the fastest and concentrate on being a reliable low cost processor which of course means we need to change our terms of business.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than just giving people the choice of accepting our new terms or finding a new processor, we have decided to come up with 3 different pricing\/settlement models that we are confident we can deliver ongoing and that we hope at least one of which is workable for your business.<\/p>\n<p>The choices are as follows:<\/p>\n<p>1. Monthly - settlement around 20th of the month for previous months transactions. 1.2% decrease in our normal fees<br \/>\nand usual 5% rolling reserve.<\/p>\n<p>2. Bi-Weekly settlement periods. Paid out around 20 days after period end. We will continue to offer existing rates and<br \/>\nusual 5% rolling reserve.<\/p>\n<p>3. Weekly settlements. Paid out around 20 days after period end. Normal rates increased by 3.5% and rolling reserve<br \/>\nincreased to 10%<\/p>\n<p>All of these options will continue to free of any annual card fees and it is our intention to switch to these new terms on 1st June.<\/p>\n<p>Your account will by default be changed to the monthly payouts option with your processing rate automatically reduced by 1.2% but if you prefer to change to the bi-weekly payouts option at your existing rates or our weekly payouts option at the premium rate with the increase in reserve, all you have to do is logon to ZOA after 1st June and make the switch in \"change banking details\".<\/p>\n<p>I very much regret that we have to make these changes, but I feel that going forward, it is important that you can count on Zombaio the way you used to be able to in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Our interest in this business is long term, and whilst I accept that we have made mistakes in the past, a lot of these have come from us trying to improve the service that we offer. We were the first processor to offer settlement to a prepaid card, and we were the first to offer EU payment by ACH. It has not been without problems of course, but we will keep working on these things until the problems disappear.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, we will shortly be adding some exciting new payment options for your customers. These include SEPA Debit, SOFORT banking and BitCoin. For CAM sites we will add a new API for card on file debits which we have been testing with very good results during the last few months.<\/p>\n<p>We will continue to try new ideas, but in the future, we will try to do so without impacting on the efficiency of our core operation.<\/p>\n<p>We really are sorry for any inconvenience and stress our unreliability recently has caused especially if you have reached out to Support or to me personally and not received the answer or action that you were looking for. I hope that you now understand a little better our situation and will give us a chance to earn back your trust over the coming months. If anything in this email is not clear or if you have any questions or comments, please let us know.<\/p>\n<p>Best regards,<\/p>\n<p>Tomas Anderson<br \/>\nVP, Zombaio LLC <\/p>\n<p>Message sent from Zombaio Notification Center - Please do not reply!\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-zombaio.1.0.6.2.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=607974","caption":"The ShortCodes and Widgets in Action"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=607974","caption":"Activating the Plugin"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=611764","caption":"Wizard Step 1"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=611764","caption":"Wizard Step 2"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=611764","caption":"Wizard Step 3"},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=611764","caption":"The Settings Page in Full"},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=607974","caption":"WP Widgets Page"},"8":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-8.png?rev=611764","caption":"Logs Interface"},"9":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-9.png?rev=755253","caption":"Page Edit - making a page public"},"10":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-10.png?rev=755254","caption":""},"11":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-11.png?rev=755245","caption":""},"12":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-12.png?rev=755245","caption":""},"13":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-13.png?rev=755245","caption":""},"14":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-zombaio\/assets\/screenshot-14.png?rev=755245","caption":""}},"tags":{"adult":"adult","membership":"membership","zombaio":"zombaio"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-zombaio.1.0.0.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-zombaio.1.0.2.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-zombaio.1.0.4.zip","1.0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-zombaio.1.0.6.zip","1.0.6.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-zombaio.1.0.6.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-zombaio.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/barrycarlyon.co.uk\/wordpress\/wordpress-plugins\/wp-zombaio\/","banners":[]}
