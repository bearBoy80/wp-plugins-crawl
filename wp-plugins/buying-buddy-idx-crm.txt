For most MLS areas, this includes coming-soon, pending, and sold properties, too. Many MLS also include rental properties as part of their IDX.<\/p>\n<p>Because IDX is considered advertising, each agent (with the permission of their managing broker) can present all listings through their website to any visitor without the need for the visitor to agree to any formal terms and conditions.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of IDX is simple: It&#8217;s a reciprocal agreement. Each participating broker contributes their listings to the IDX database (they opt-in) and is in turn able to display listings from all other participating brokers on their website.<br \/>\nThese days, practically all listings from your MLS are now included with IDX.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Did you know?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>NAR made reciprocal Internet Data eXchange a mandatory policy effective Jan 1, 2002.<br \/>\nBuying Buddy was one of the very first solutions created to incorporate IDX.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='benefits%20of%20idx'>\nBenefits of IDX\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>IDX is one of the most amazing assets any real estate agent or broker has to aid their marketing and sales.<br \/>\nYou can <a href=\"https:\/\/buyingbuddy.com\/real-estate-marketing.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">exploit the entire MLS<\/a> for your own marketing benefit.<br \/>\nFor example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use any or all listings in the MLS to highlight your own listings, knowledge, and expertise<\/li>\n<li>Give your clients and prospects an advanced property search on your own website, branded to you<\/li>\n<li>Showcase your own listings &#8211; both active and sold<\/li>\n<li>Create multiple landing pages to present different types of properties or focus on neighborhoods and market areas<\/li>\n<li>Use listings and search services to capture leads<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20add%20idx%20to%20my%20website%3F'>\nHow do I add IDX to My Website?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Buying Buddy provides the simplest and fastest way to add IDX and MLS to your website.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Install IDX Plugin<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Follow the installation instructions to add Buying Buddy to your website.<br \/>\nYou will be able to immediately see the plugin in action by searching for and viewing properties.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do More<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Use the Buying Buddy shortcodes to add more MLS and marketing content all over your real estate website.<br \/>\nThe Wizards in your Buying Buddy dashboard will generate the shortcodes you need to show filtered properties in a grid, list, or map, wherever you want.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20free%20trial%3F'>\nIs there a free trial?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
