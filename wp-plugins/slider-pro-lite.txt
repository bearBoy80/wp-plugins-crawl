My first slider was Revolution as it came bundled with Avada. When tuning the site I discovered how slow Rev Slider was and went on to test about 8 new sliders. \n\nI'm a photographer so loading big slide shows is important to me. With that said, it doesn't matter how big, or how many slides you are loading to suffer a major speed penalty with most sliders (especially Rev). The code itself significantly slows page loads.\n\nI wound up with Slider Pro which was by far the lightest and fastest I was able to find and test. It's easy to use, and again, super fast. It's hard to imagine that anyone that cares about the UE, or SEO wouldn't make this same change. \n\nIt's not true that it has not been updated in two years, I get regular updates. You can see all the updates and activity at codecanyon. The support has been amazing as well. The developer, David, is obsessed with speed and simplicity. You should be too, sliders can be so detrimental to load times.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/slider-pro-lite.1.4.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/slider-pro-lite\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1964205","caption":"The list with all the created sliders."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/slider-pro-lite\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1964205","caption":"The user interface for creating and editing a slider."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/slider-pro-lite\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=1964205","caption":"The preview window in the admin area."}},"tags":{"images":"images","responsive-slider":"responsive slider","slider":"slider","slider-plugin":"slider plugin","touch-slider":"touch slider"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/slider-pro-lite.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/slider-pro-lite.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/slider-pro-lite.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/slider-pro-lite.1.3.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/slider-pro-lite.1.4.zip","1.4.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/slider-pro-lite.1.4.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/slider-pro-lite.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/slider-pro-lite\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1964205","high":false}}
