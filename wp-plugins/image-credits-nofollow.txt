URLs are nofollow (no follow) by default, but you have the option to follow them. With a shortcode and various options to display image credits in the posts.<\/p>\n<p>The three display options of the credits are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shortcode: [image-credit] with optional attributes are <code>sep<\/code>, <code>before<\/code> and <code>after<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Template Tag: <code>the_image_credits()<\/code> with optional parameters are <code>sep<\/code>, <code>before<\/code> and <code>after<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Display the credits automatically before or after the content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There is a setting page in SETTINGS \/ IMAGE CREDITS that allows to setup the automatic credit display, including the HTML definitions.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin is a fork of the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/better-image-credits\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Better Image Credits plugin<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/cvedovini\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Claude Vedovini<\/a>, which is a fork of the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/image-credits\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Image Credits plugin<\/a><br \/>\nby <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/adamcapriola\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Adam Capriola<\/a>. This plugin is 100% compatible with both of them, so if you are already using the Image Credit plugin or the Better Image Credit plugin, just replace them<br \/>\nwith this one and it will work about the same way, including the nofollow of the Source URL of the images.<\/p>\n<p>The main difference with the &#8220;Image Credits&#8221; plugin is that you can choose that the plugin automatically adds the credits before or at the end of a post.<br \/>\nThe main difeerence with the &#8220;Better Image Credits&#8221; plugin is that the Source URL links are NOFOLLOW by default and you can choose to make it DOFOLLOW if you want. We also removed the OVERLAY display option, which included additional Javascript and we think is not usefull because of the compatibility problems with the different themes.<\/p>\n<h4>What can I do with this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>This plugin adds the Source Name, Source URL and the option to follow the Source URL link to the media uploaded in WordPress.<br \/>\nAnd this image credits can be displayed in three different forms.<\/p>\n<h4>How do I configure the plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>Please navigate to SETTINGS \/ IMAGE CREDITS and choose options or fill in the data.

Our plugins allready havae this POT file in the \/languages\/ folder.<\/li>\n<li>Use a plain text editor or a special localization tool to generate a translation for each piece of text. This produces a PO file (Portable Object). The only difference between a POT and PO file is that the PO file contains translations.<\/li>\n<li>Compile the PO file to produce a MO file (Machine Object), which can then be used in the theme or plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>In order to translate a plugin you will need a special software tool like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.poedit.net\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">poEdit<\/a>, which is a cross-platform graphical tool that is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.<\/p>\n<p>The naming of your PO and MO files is very important and must match the desired locale. The naming convention is: <code>language_COUNTRY.po<\/code> and plugins have an additional naming convention whereby the plugin name is added to the filename: <code>pluginname-fr_FR.po<\/code><\/p>\n<p>That is, the plugin name name must be the language code followed by an underscore, followed by a code for the country (in uppercase). If the encoding of the file is not UTF-8 then the encoding must be specified.<\/p>\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>en_US ? US English<\/li>\n<li>en_UK ? UK English<\/li>\n<li>es_ES ? Spanish from Spain<\/li>\n<li>fr_FR ? French from France<\/li>\n<li>zh_CN ? Simplified Chinese<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A list of language codes can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ISO_639\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>, and country codes can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.
