This plugin allows quick and easy installation of your promotion with the use of shortcode <strong>&#091;woobox&#093;<\/strong> for embedding on WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>Woobox helps you easily create powerful contests, sweepstakes, coupons, quizzes and more to grow your audience and amplify your marketing.<\/p>\n<p>You could embed promotions on WordPress before, but the process was complicated and didn&#8217;t work for all types of users on WordPress. We wanted to simplify the process, so we created the <strong>Woobox<\/strong> plugin and made it available for all our faithful WordPress users. You create a promotion on Woobox, grab the WordPress shortcode and with the plugin installed on your WordPress site, just paste it into any post or page on WordPress and that&#8217;s it.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t have a Woobox account?

Only Editors and Admins can copy and paste the JavaScript embed code to embed a Woobox promotion onto a WordPress page, authors cannot.<\/p>\n<p>With embed codes you need to make sure to be in the &#8220;Text&#8221; tab of the writing area. If a user is in the &#8220;Visual&#8221; (default) tab, the embed code will not work. Shortcodes will always work in either text editor.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='i%20already%20have%20a%20promotion%20using%20the%20old%20embed%20code%21%20will%20it%20still%20work%20on%20wordpress%3F'>\nI already have a promotion using the old embed code! Will it still work on WordPress?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Your promotions will continue to function with no problem. Honestly, if you want to keep using the old method for embedding, that&#8217;s fine. We just created the shortcode, like it was said before, because it&#8217;s cleaner and simpler.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20difficult%20to%20install%20and%20setup%3F'>\nIs it difficult to install and setup?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope, it&#8217;s so easy!

This is advanced functionality, and only recommended if there are specific keys\/values you need to pass to your offer&#8217;s custom JavaScript.<\/li>\n<li><strong>style<\/strong>: Optional parameter that changes the way your offer is displayed on the page. Default value is &#8220;embed&#8221;, but can also be set to &#8220;popup&#8221; if you want to go that route.<\/li>\n<li><strong>trigger&#042;&#042;<\/strong>: Possible values: &#8220;enter&#8221; show when page loads; &#8220;exit&#8221; show when user is detected leaving page; &#8220;timer:8&#8221; show after a certain number of seconds (8 in this example);<\/li>\n<li><strong>expire&#042;&#042;<\/strong>: Determines how often (in days) the popup is displayed to any given user.
