We contacted ZenDesk support last week about this issue, hoping for an update to the plugin, but have so far heard nothing back.\n\nAs such, we have now left the plugin deactivated and are waiting for an update at some point, and now looking at ending our ZenDesk Chat subscriptions.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Good, but could be much better<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"3 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"3\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ron-killian\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/2b584eb5cb18909b736287e2f91e2ac6?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/2b584eb5cb18909b736287e2f91e2ac6?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ron-killian\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Ron Killian<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">March 2, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I use the paid version and over all I am happy. It is the best support system for wordpress that I've used. Plus I don't have to worry about any support issues getting lost like with a email contact form.\n\nBut as already mentioned in the previous review, it could be so much better. Yes, it would be SO nice to have some control over the widget form, there is little to no customization available. \n\nFor example, I would like to add a  small blurb on the form that asks people to check my FAQ page (with a link), before submitting. Many of the support questions I get could be answered with my FAQ page. They could get an answer to their question right away, without needing to wait on me to respond. And it would save me some support time.\n\nI agree, for such a big company that has been around for so long, you'd think they could do it better. They are always adding features that I really don't need, but the simple little things, but important things, like customizing the widget\/form don't seem to be as important.\n\nGive us access to customize the form and I would give it 5 stars.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.8.5.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/zendesk\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2962717","caption":"An overview of some of the features available in the settings page"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/zendesk\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2962717","caption":"Remote authentication, super easy to set up"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/zendesk\/trunk\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2962717","caption":"Turn a comment into a ticket with ease"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/zendesk\/trunk\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2962717","caption":"The comment to ticket interface"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/zendesk\/trunk\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2962717","caption":"The Web Widget at its simplest, a Contact Form that creates a ticket in your Zendesk when filled out"},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/zendesk\/trunk\/screenshot-6.png?rev=2962717","caption":"If you have a Zendesk Help Center, the Web Widget can help deflect tickets by showing your self-service content when users search for help"},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/zendesk\/trunk\/screenshot-7.png?rev=2962717","caption":"The Zendesk dropbox in action"}},"tags":{"customer-support":"customer support","help-desk":"help desk","helpdesk":"helpdesk","support":"support","zendesk":"zendesk"},"versions":{"1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.3.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.4.zip","1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.5.zip","1.5.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.5.1.zip","1.5.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.5.2.zip","1.6.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.6.0.zip","1.6.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.6.1.zip","1.6.10":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.6.10.zip","1.6.11":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.6.11.zip","1.6.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.6.2.zip","1.6.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.6.3.zip","1.6.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.6.4.zip","1.6.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.6.5.zip","1.6.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.6.6.zip","1.6.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.6.7.zip","1.6.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.6.8.zip","1.6.9":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.6.9.zip","1.7.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.7.0.zip","1.7.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.7.2.zip","1.7.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.7.3.zip","1.8.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.1.8.5.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/zendesk.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/zendesk\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1543773","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/zendesk\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1543773"}}
