Simple Members Area<br \/>\nallows you to setup a section of your site that logged in users can access in a matter of minutes.<\/p>\n<p>The premise is simple, you create your &#8220;members area&#8221; by creating pages and saving them as &#8220;private.&#8221; Then you can choose which<br \/>\nprivate page your members should be redirected to upon login. Conceivably this page would have links to your other private pages<br \/>\n(if there are any.)<\/p>\n<p>With this plugin you can have a default landing page or have a specific page for each user as well.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.<\/p>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the &#8216;simple-members-area&#8217; to the &#8216;\/wp-content\/plugins\/&#8217; directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Create a page that you&#8217;d like to be the landing page for your users and save it as &#8220;private&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Add a user with the role of &#8220;member&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Select the private page you just added as their login page<\/li>\n<li>You&#8217;re done! When the user logs in they will be redirected to the appropriate page<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Do pages have to be private?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Technically no, but then anyone can access them if they have the web address.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I remove &#8220;PRIVATE&#8221; from the begining of the page title?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;d recommend using the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-helpers\/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress Helpers plugin<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I have an entire members section?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely.
