Designed to display pictures related to your business\/organization in the background at an event or in your office, there is no need to configure any settings or controls. Image captions\/descriptions are automatically displayed as well, and can be configured based on your needs.<\/p>\n<p>Once activated, you can view the slideshow by visiting <code>http:\/\/yourdomain.com\/slideshow<\/code>. All JPEG images will be displayed (since .jpg is best for pictures, while .png and .gif are typically used for graphics).<\/p>\n<p>Please note that it is not currently possible to pause the slideshow or go back; the slideshow is not designed for personal viewing. However, clicking\/tapping on the image will open its attachment page in a new tab, allowing images to be contextualized or edited easily.<\/p>\n<p>The slideshow can also be embedded into your site via a widget or a shortcode.<\/p>\n<p>You can control some options by adjusting the url of the slideshow. Parameters are controlled via query string (and widget options and shortcode attributes).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>size<\/code> is the size of the image to load, either <code>thumbnail<\/code> (discouraged), <code>medium<\/code>, <code>large<\/code>, <code>full<\/code>, or <code>auto<\/code>, which uses medium or large depending on <code>wp_is_mobile()<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li><code>year<\/code> is the 4-digit numeric year in which the images were published.<\/li>\n<li><code>month<\/code> is the numeric month in which the images were published (between 1 and 12), typically but not necessarily used in conjunction with <code>year<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li><code>mode<\/code> defines a subset of images to use, such as <code>featured<\/code> for featured images only.<\/li>\n<li><code>captions<\/code> controls the captions display: either <code>auto<\/code>, <code>none<\/code>, <code>title<\/code>, <code>titlecaption<\/code>, <code>caption<\/code>, or <code>description<\/code>. Caption data is read from the image attachment post and can be updated in the media library.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Using all options, for example:<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/example.com\/slideshow?size=full&amp;year=2014&amp;month=4&amp;mode=featured&amp;captions=titlecaption<\/p>\n<p>You can see it in action <a href=\"http:\/\/uscasce.com\/slideshow\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Take the easy route and install through the WordPress plugin adder OR<\/li>\n<li>Download the .zip file and upload the unzipped folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Go to <code>http:\/\/yourdomain.com\/slideshow<\/code> to see the slideshow in action. Add a widget version from the Widgets section in the Customizer or add the [content_slideshow] shortcode to a post or page.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='where%27s%20the%20settings%20page%3F'>\nWhere&#8217;s the settings page?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>For simplicity&#8217;s sake, no settings page is included. Settings for this plugin tend to depend on the exact situation in which you are using it, so rather than going to the setting page every time you want to use it, you can adjust the parameters via tweaks to the slideshow url (see details below).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20happened%20to%20my%20page%20at%20%2Fslideshow%3F'>\nWhat happened to my page at \/slideshow?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin overrides WordPress at the <code>slideshow\/<\/code> url. If you have a post\/page with that slug, it will no longer be accessible on the front-end. This may be desired; for example, you could create an empty slideshow page so that you have a record of the plugin&#8217;s presence and can more easily add it to navigation menus. You don&#8217;t have to have a page thee, though, and you can manually add the slideshow URL to your navigation menus.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='loading%20higher%20quality%20images'>\nLoading higher quality images\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can force the plugin to always show the highest resolution pictures available by using the <code>size<\/code> query argument (<code>http:\/\/example.com\/slideshow?size=full<\/code>). Note that this could cause speed issues with loading the images if your internet connection or your web server is slow.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='loading%20images%20from%20a%20specific%20time%20frame'>\nLoading images from a specific time frame\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin supports <code>year<\/code> and <code>month<\/code> parameters that can be used to only show images uploaded in a given time period (see the description for an example).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='using%20the%20shortcode'>\nUsing the Shortcode\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The shortcode version supports all four parameters that the full URL version supports, as attributes:<br \/>\n    [content_slideshow size=&#8221;medium&#8221; year=&#8221;2014&#8243; month=&#8221;1&#8243; mode=&#8221;featured&#8221;]<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>2.4.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix missing file in 2.4 release package.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add code comments for the slideshow JS.<\/li>\n<li>Lazy-load slideshow iframes in widgets and shortcodes.
