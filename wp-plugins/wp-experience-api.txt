What's unbelievable about this add-in is that it is i) about one of two hits on \"tin can\" or \"xapi\" on plugins library (the other being one for the H5P connector); and ii) 20+ downloads in last 6 - 12 months this has been available.  Makes me think that Tin Can doesn't have much of a following (yet), but given SCORM is, or should be, dead or dying, would think only a matter of time.<\/p>\n<p>Suggests that there are fewer than 20 sites out there with i) non-PHP programmers managing them; and ii) any interest in sending standard \"left a comment on my WP site\" statements to an LRS.<\/p>\n<p>In any event, the plug-in does exactly what it should.  I punched in some user codes for a GrassBlade LRS I have, and it worked just as you'd expect, so you can add that LRS to the list of \"somewhat test\" set-ups.  (I used the API keys, etc. that were derived from spending $49.00 on that plugin -- did see if more normal credentials would work or not.)<\/p>\n<p>Only reason not 5 stars, is that the plugin is just not that fully developed to allow for the range of interactions one might hope for.  For instance, it did recognize the action of leaving a comment on a BBPress forum, but the title, but what showed up in the LRS as a \"title\" (I guess object of statement), didn't seem quite connected to the specific page.<\/p>\n<p>As well, and in fairness to developer who certainly has not indicated otherwise, I use some random ratings plug-in (not the theme item specifically noted), and I can't capture the action of \"rating a post\", which is on my list of activities I'd like to track.<\/p>\n<p>In any event, all good.  This plug-in would think deserves some more downloads and a few more reviews.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-experience-api.1.0.6.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-experience-api\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1213629","caption":"The network level administration screen for a Multisite WordPress installtion."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-experience-api\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1213629","caption":"Site level administration page for users autorized to set the LRS at the site level."}},"tags":{"badgeos":"badgeOS","experience-api":"experience api","lrs":"LRS","tincan":"Tincan","xapi":"xAPI"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-experience-api.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-experience-api.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-experience-api.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-experience-api.1.0.3.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-experience-api.1.0.4.zip","1.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-experience-api.1.0.5.zip","1.0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-experience-api.1.0.6.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-experience-api.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
