Use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.how2wordpress.usa.cc\/support\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Web Page<\/a> instead.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Switch wordpress-login.php<\/em> is a very light plugin that lets you easily and safely change WordPress-login.php to anything you want. It doesn\u2019t literally rename or change files in core, nor does it add rewrite rules. It simply intercepts page requests and works on any WordPress website. The wp-admin directory and wp-login.php page become inaccessible, so you should bookmark or remember the url. Deactivating this plugin brings your site back exactly to the state it was before. If You Have Any Problem With This Plugin Contact Our WP Web Teach Team. www.how2wordpress.usa.cc\/support\/<\/p>\n<h4>Compatibility<\/h4>\n<p>All login related things such as the registration form, lost password form, login widget and expired sessions just keep working.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also compatible with any plugin that hooks in the login form, including<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>BuddyPress,<\/li>\n<li>WooCommerce,<\/li>\n<li>TML,<\/li>\n<li>UserPro,<\/li>\n<li>and User Switching.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Works with multisite, but not tested with Domain And subdomains. Activating it for a network allows you to set a networkwide default. Individual sites can still rename their login page to something else.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re using a <strong>page caching plugin<\/strong> you should add the slug of the new login url to the list of pages not to cache.<\/p>\n<p>If you wish, you can block wp-login.php with <code>.htaccess<\/code> from now on.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Go to Plugins \u203a Add New.<\/li>\n<li>Search for <em>Switch WordPress-login.php<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>Look for this plugin, download and activate it.<\/li>\n<li>The page will redirect you to the settings.
