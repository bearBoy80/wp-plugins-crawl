Our plugin Thoughtful Comments supercharges comment moderation by moving it into the front end (i.e. in context). It also allows banning by IP, email address or domain.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike many comment plugins, Thoughtful Comments works hand in hand with Akismet, feeding all the information into Akismet as well as the existing WordPress whitelist and blacklist features.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s cool about Thoughtful Comments is that you can add it to a WordPress site with no changes to existing comment moderation tables and you can remove it from a WordPress site with no loss of core functionality. I.e. I think Thoughtful Comments could be integrated into core with a minimum amount of pain. Thoughtful Comments works with all current Subscribe to Comment plugins as well. As we use all core functions and tables, Thoughtful Comments works with all current Subscribe to Comment plugins as well.<\/p>\n<p>Thoughtful Comments is the most powerful and useful code we\u2019ve ever written (we have four very popular plugins). It\u2019s integration into core would save many, many site owners the pain of Disqus.<\/p>\n<p>Thoughtful Comments is entirely stable and active on some of the most heavily commented political and lifestyle sites in the world.<\/p>\n<p>While Automattic has a horse in the ring (Intense Debate), we&#8217;d really like to see Thoughtful Comments included in core.<\/p>\n<h3>Features:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Front-end comment moderation &#8211;
