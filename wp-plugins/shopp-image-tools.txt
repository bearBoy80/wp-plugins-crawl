If you are a<br \/>\nShopp-minded developer and are interesting in taking over the reins, though, please feel free to contact me or simply<br \/>\nfork the code\/start afresh\/whatever you prefer (and apply to the good people at wordpress.org for a new repo here in the<br \/>\nplugin directory if that is fastest) \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No limit on the number of images you can convert<\/li>\n<li>Optionally remove the old images from the database after migration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Shopp Image Tools is a utility plugin for users of the <a href=\"https:\/\/shopplugin.net\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shopp e-commerce plugin<\/a>.<br \/>\nBy default, Shopp is configured so that product images are stored in the database, this means additional database<br \/>\nuse every time one of these images is fetched.<\/p>\n<p>While this mode can be turned off there is no built-in mechanism to pull the images back out of the database and<br \/>\nstore them as regular files &#8211; that is what this plugin is designed to help with. It now also includes tools to<br \/>\nclean-up the database that you can optionally enable.<\/p>\n<h4>Author<\/h4>\n<p>This plugin was written by <a href=\"http:\/\/codingkills.me\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Barry Hughes<\/a>, a Vancouver Island based cloud-head and core<br \/>\nShopp developer.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>This plugin should be installed as per any other plugin. Upload the .zip archive via the plugin admin page or<br \/>\nupload the uncompressed shopp-image-tools directory via FTP, then activate via the plugin admin page.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Why migrate images from the database to the filesystem<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Very often, especially when Shopp is being used in a shared hosting environment, this allows for far faster<br \/>\ndelivery of images and reduces the burden on server resources considerably.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What Should I Do Before Converting?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Set up a directory to store your disk based images, something like <code>wp-content\/uploads\/shopp<\/code> is fine. You will<br \/>\nneed to adjust the Shopp System settings to reflect this &#8230; if in doubt, seek advice from the Shopp documentation.<\/p>\n<p>As soon as you&#8217;re done, get back to Shopp Image Tools and run the conversion tool. No need to worry &#8211; if you<br \/>\nhaven&#8217;t set something up properly, it will very likely tell you the problem!<\/p>\n<p>As always, you should back-up before making any major adjustments to your system and remember: a back-up is useless<br \/>\nif you do not know how to restore it.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What about Direct Mode?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Traditionally (and even now, if you elect to store product images in the database) all image requests flowed through<br \/>\nthe Shopp Image Server. Though that is pretty much as fast and streamlined as it can be, it still incurs additional<br \/>\noverhead.<\/p>\n<p>Previous versions of this plugin introduced Direct Image Mode which allowed your web server (ie, Apache) to serve<br \/>\nimages directly &#8211; without any further overhead. I&#8217;m pleased to say this functionality is now baked into Shopp itself<br \/>\nand so Direct Image Mode has been removed from all Shopp 1.3-oriented versions of this plugin.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Removing Old Images<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once images have successfully been migrated to the file system the old copy, by default, remains in the database.<br \/>\nThis is intentional as the plugin aims to be as non-destructive as possible. However, some people may wish to remove<br \/>\nunused copies of images from the database completely for performance reasons or simply as a matter of good housekeeping.<\/p>\n<p>Version 1.1 introduces a toolset to do just this. You can instruct the Conversion Tool to clean up after successfully<br \/>\nmigrating images and if you forget to do this you can also use the Orphan Cleanup Tool to locate disused images within<br \/>\nthe database and purge them. I strongly recommend that you back-up before using these tools.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.3.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Retooled for Shopp 1.3 (and tested against the WP 3.8 release candidate)<\/li>\n<li>Direct Image Mode removed as no longer necessary<\/li>\n<li>Version numbering brought into line with that of Shopp itself<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for anti-timeout mechanism (orphan finder)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added cleanup tools to optionally remove images from the database (once they have been successfully moved to the<br \/>\nfilesystem)<\/li>\n<li>Improved feedback: the summary of totals now updates as the conversion job progresses<\/li>\n<li>Thanks to Albert Boddema for supporting this release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Public release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/shopp-image-tools\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=663370\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/shopp-image-tools\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=663370\" alt=\"Shopp Image Tools can be accessed from the Shopp Setup menu - its nestled conveniently under the existing\nSetup &gt; Images option.
