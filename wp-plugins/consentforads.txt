We are listed by the IAB as a platform that allows us to pass opt-ins and opt-outs to your ad tech and advertising partners.  The framework allows us to pass real consent to your advertising partners in Europe.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What is a CMP and why is IAB accreditation important?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>While there are many GDPR plugins on WordPress none of them actually have any technical ability to pass consent to your advertising partners.  The IAB tech framework allows this to happen.  ConsentForAds allows publishers to continue to make money while conforming to the GDPR regulations.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Will my European ad revenue be affected by GDPR?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.  Most of your advertising revenue in Europe comes from programmatic &#8211; and GDPR is going to hit it hard without a reliable solution in place.  Google have already told its partners it will not buy inventory from any third party without an explicit opt-in.  ConsentForAds helps you do this.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why should i implement this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>ConsentForAds is a tool built by publishers for publishers. The key reasons you need to have a proper compliant Consent Management Platform like ConsentForAds solution include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only GDPR compliant sites can maintain programmatic spend, as most European WordPress publisher revenue comes from data-driven buys<\/li>\n<li>Threat of litigation from consumer advocates and private European citizens<\/li>\n<li>Compliance with GDPR regulations and user privacy, as all 3rd party cookies running on your site require explicit opt-ins<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Will this plugin cover all my advertising partners?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The answer is NO.  Unless they are listed in the IAB global list &#8211;  <a href=\"http:\/\/advertisingconsent.eu\/transparency-consent-framework-global-vendor-list\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http:\/\/advertisingconsent.eu\/transparency-consent-framework-global-vendor-list\/<\/a>.  For the most part most of your ad tech and advertising partners will be listed.  If not, you run the risk of non-compliance.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Where is Google on this list?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Google is expected to announce its inclusion in the list in the coming weeks.  We are set up to cover all Google products once they have entered the IAB Tech Framework.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Displaying a consent for ads tool<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consentforads\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1881208\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consentforads\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1881208\" alt=\"This screen shows how the ConsentForAds icon looks like on website.\"><\/a><p>This screen shows how the ConsentForAds icon looks like on website.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consentforads\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1881208\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consentforads\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1881208\" alt=\"This screen shows how the window to edit consents looks like to your users.\"><\/a><p>This screen shows how the window to edit consents looks like to your users.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Excellent !<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/astr0wp\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1285a5dfb23dc021a587379e78a64810?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1285a5dfb23dc021a587379e78a64810?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/astr0wp\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">astr0wp<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">June 5, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Thank you for this.\n\nMost very small businesses would not know what to do, never mind not be able to afford a developer!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Good!!!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/lore24\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/07f6dc7943833861cfe11dd9ea3b3eb0?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/07f6dc7943833861cfe11dd9ea3b3eb0?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/lore24\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">lore24<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 29, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Good plugin! \nI do not know how to translate the text into the Italian pop-up \"We want you to be happy...ect.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/consentforads.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consentforads\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1881208","caption":"This screen shows how the ConsentForAds icon looks like on website."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consentforads\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1881208","caption":"This screen shows how the window to edit consents looks like to your users."}},"tags":{"advertising":"advertising","consent":"consent","gdpr":"GDPR","tool":"tool","unveilmedia":"unveilmedia"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consentforads\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1881208","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/consentforads\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1881208"}}
