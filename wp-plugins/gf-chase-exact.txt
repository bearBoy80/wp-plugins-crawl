There was an issue with the Products field`s conditional logic and Products Dropdown; sending data even if the fields were hidden - but they fixed it within a few hours after I mentionned it. This plugin makes my life much easier as there's is not much alternatives out there.  After my int\u00e9raction with the developpers, I'm confident that I can rely on this plugin in the future.
