Loved how easy it was for me to get started without having to do any research, which all the other plugins seemed to require.  I was able to post my jobs immediately, and also to see all its functionalities.  I also tested the resume upload function and loved it.  The only downside was it doesn't allow you to put the jobs in categories, I will look out for that function.  They also have amazing support.  I have used plugins for over my 15 years of working with wordpress, and never have I been contacted by the designer to find out how I was faring or to offer help.  This plugin definitely earned a 5-star rating!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-job-portal-by-jane.1.2.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-job-portal-by-jane\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1651218","caption":"<p>All Jobs listed in admin.<\/p>"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-job-portal-by-jane\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1651218","caption":"<p>Add New job.<\/p>"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-job-portal-by-jane\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1651218","caption":"<p>Jobs listed on careers page.<\/p>"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-job-portal-by-jane\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1651218","caption":"<p>Display of single job.<\/p>"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-job-portal-by-jane\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1651218","caption":"<p>Applying to a job.<\/p>"},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-job-portal-by-jane\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=1651218","caption":"<p>Inviting a manager to create new jobs.<\/p>"}},"tags":{"career-page":"career page","careers":"careers","human-resources":"human resources","job-portal":"job portal","jobs":"jobs"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-job-portal-by-jane.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-job-portal-by-jane.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-job-portal-by-jane.1.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-job-portal-by-jane.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-job-portal-by-jane\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1633653","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-job-portal-by-jane\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1633653"}}
