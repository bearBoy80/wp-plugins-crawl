Our chatbot can assist you with that! Although it appears simple, the possibilities are limitless, with a variety of parameters and concepts to explore. Visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/meowapps.com\/ai-engine\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official documentation<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\n<p>Take your AI capabilities to the next level with finetuning and embeddings. By reusing your website&#8217;s content and other pertinent information, you can train your AI to better cater to your target audience. AI Engine makes this process simple and straightforward with its user-friendly interface. If you&#8217;d like to learn more about finetuning, check out our article: <a href=\"https:\/\/meowapps.com\/wordpress-chatbot-finetuned-model-ai\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How to Train an AI Model<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Your AI Copilot<\/h3>\n<p>In the WordPress editor, hit space and type your question! AI Copilot offers many suggestions to help you think and write quickly. Use the wand symbol to fix your text, translate it, shorten or lengthen it, and find alternative words.<\/p>\n<h3>Generate Content, Images &amp; More<\/h3>\n<p>Simply adjust the parameters to your preference, customize the prompts, and discover the results. You can save your parameters as templates for future use, generate content in bulk, and even produce images. The AI Playground also enables you to create your own custom use cases, such as swiftly acquiring recipes based on your refrigerator&#8217;s contents or quickly drafting restaurant reviews. With AI Engine, the possibilities are endless, and you can personalize the user interface to suit your needs.<\/p>\n<h3>Boost your WordPress with AI<\/h3>\n<p>AI Engine offers its own internal API that can be utilized by various plugins. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/media-file-renamer\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Media File Renamer<\/a> leverages this API to suggest improved filenames for media files. Additionally, <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/social-engine\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Social Engine<\/a>, a plugin that facilitates post-sharing on social media platforms, can also benefit from AI Engine&#8217;s capabilities to create accompanying text.<\/p>\n<h3>My Dream for AI<\/h3>\n<p>I am thrilled about the endless opportunities that AI brings. But, at the same time, I can&#8217;t help but hope for a world where AI is used for good, and not just to dominate the web with generated content. My dream is to see AI being utilized to enhance our productivity, empower new voices to be heard (because let&#8217;s be real, not everyone is a native speaker or may have challenges when it comes to writing), and help us save time on tedious tasks so we can spend more precious moments with our loved ones and the world around us.<\/p>\n<p>I will always advocate this, and I hope you do too \ud83d\udc95<\/p>\n<h3>Open AI<\/h3>\n<p>The AI Engine utilizes the API from <a href=\"https:\/\/beta.openai.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OpenAI<\/a>.

Tons of features and very well thought out design. If you're looking to add Open AI to Wordpress, this plugin does the job!

I've only used the free version, but I've already been very impressed with the results and easy of setup, so much so I will be buying the paid version as soon as possible for the ability to add an extensive knowledgebase to my site's Chatbot through embeds. <br \/><br \/>A few clicks, a copy and paste from the OpenAI API key, and a quick selection of the model you want to use and you're off to the races and getting high quality response. It really could not be easier to setup. <br \/><br \/>The only features I have used so far are the chatbot features, but for me that's worth many times the price of admission alone as it allows me to provide a unique product for my clients that is highly interesting in these days where AI is all the hype. I tried several other free chatbot offerings for WP and they were extremely limiting or hard to get functioning, and charged for many of the same versions that AI Engine offers for free. <br \/><br \/>It works seamlessly with ChatGPT's Playground and Assistant API, and allows me to seamlessly select between GTP 3.5 Turbo (low cost), or GPT4-Turbo, GTP4-Vision, for testing, etc. I also reached out to the developer with a question, and they personally responded THE SAME DAY with a REAL SOLUTION! Not only that, but his response also came with a special blend of empathy and sincerity. 1 on 1 support is insanely rare in this day and age. <br \/><br \/>Not to mention, the developer has an active community on Discord, and lots of people sharing advice and usage suggestions. <br \/><br \/>I can't wait to dive deeper and have time to really see what this plugin system is capable of, and I will certainly update my review in the future once I do. <br \/><br \/>In short: This is the plugin you're looking for if you need AI generated content and chatbots. This developer is a rare gem and deserves our support. Save yourself the time and trouble and don't bother with other plugins offering similar features, this one has it all. - Nathan<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">&quot;Wow, I am absolutely blown away by the AI Engine plugin!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/markrutger\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/103d0af88f62e43463c374ca6187ee86?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/103d0af88f62e43463c374ca6187ee86?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/markrutger\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">markrutger<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 19, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">\"Wow, I am absolutely blown away by the AI Engine plugin!
