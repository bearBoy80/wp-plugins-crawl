Previously when a null value was returned, no validation would error, and a warning (or fatal error in PHP8) would occur. Now unless an array is returned, the previous error messages will be preserved and a message will be triggered for improper use.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: The autocomplete page dropdown would be cut off because of an overflow styling issue when embedding a form into an existing page in a modal.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Using &#8220;description&#8221; as a field key would trigger a fatal error on entries list pages.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Search wasn&#8217;t working on the Import\/Export page.<\/li>\n<li>The form builder now applies more strict filtering and escaping when previewing real time updates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.2.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Forms submitted with AJAX would display an unexpected &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry. It looks like you&#8217;ve already submitted that&#8221; message when WooCommerce v7.6.0 is active.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Added an extra check so invalid serialized data doesn&#8217;t trigger any warning or errors when an unexpected array key type is found.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: XML exports would fail to import because of an unexpected carriage return at the beginning of the file, or an unexpected meta tag added by the Equity WordPress theme. In these cases the XML string will now be corrected in order for the import to work.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Added a callable check to avoid a &#8220;Call to undefined function FrmProAddonsController::print_grace&#8221; error when upgrading.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: The license warning banner would overflow on top of other page elements.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Added additional validation for style settings.

With Formidable, there\u2019s no limit to what you can achieve! The possibilities are endless.<\/p>\n<p>Formidable adapts to YOUR needs.<\/p>\n<p>Want to run quizzes on your site? Formidable is your quiz maker with all the features you need to create and run both educational quizzes and the beloved (and addictive) BuzzFeed style quizzes.<\/p>\n<p>Our team has worked hard to create the Swiss Army Knife for WordPress. Plus, we\u2019ve made integrations that fit into your tech stack.<\/p>\n<p>Check out some of our main features below:<\/p>\n<h3>Drag &amp; Drop Form Maker<\/h3>\n<p>Our form maker comes with all the powerful fields that you need to create a solution-focused form, fast!<\/p>\n<p>Formidable drag and drop forms allow you to quickly build unlimited surveys, quizzes, price calculators, and whatever else you need.<\/p>\n<h3>Complete Entry Management for Web Forms and Surveys<\/h3>\n<p>When a user submits a web form, it&#8217;s stored in your WordPress database so you won\u2019t lose any leads. Formidable allows you to view all your quiz and survey entries right from your WordPress dashboard (even in the free version!).<\/p>\n<p>Even though the entries are saved, it&#8217;s still a <strong>GDPR-friendly<\/strong> form generator. You can turn off IP tracking or stop saving submissions entirely. Or add a GDPR checkbox field to your lead forms and payment forms to collect consent.<\/p>\n<p>Need to import your leads to an external service like Mailchimp? No problem. <strong>Export leads to a CSV<\/strong>, open it in Excel, or import it anywhere.<\/p>\n<p>You can also configure unlimited email notifications and autoresponders triggered by submissions.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, you can easily customize the success message after a form is submitted, or redirect visitors to another page.<\/p>\n<h3>The Only Form Maker Plugin with an Advanced Styler<\/h3>\n<p>With our built-in styler, you can instantly customize the look and feel of your website form. With just a few clicks, your email form can be transformed to match your website design.<\/p>\n<p>By default, a single styling template is created. If you want a custom form style for each footer and sidebar form, check out the premium version of Formidable.<\/p>\n<h3>Build Smart Surveys with Beautiful Reports<\/h3>\n<p>Formidable Pro includes an intuitive survey feature (like Survey Monkey, but without the high costs), so you can quickly create powerful surveys with Net Promoter Scores (NPS), Likert fields, star ratings, image radio buttons, and more.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that data alone does no good if you can&#8217;t analyze it. That\u2019s why we make it easy to analyze data from a survey, quiz, or calculator. Beautiful reports will be waiting for you, or create your own customized graphs. Our graphs and reports will help you analyze and showcase data.<\/p>\n<p>You can even showcase data on the front-end of your website. Just embed graphs in your WordPress posts or pages.<\/p>\n<p>The best part is that you can do this all without any third-party tools.<\/p>\n<h3>Quickly Create an Advanced WordPress Registration Form for Any Use Case<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you need to create a youth sports team, event, or church retreat registration, Formidable has you covered.

We see real estate listings, employment listings, event calendars, business or member directories, job boards, and other searchable databases.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, Formidable is not your average contact form plugin.
