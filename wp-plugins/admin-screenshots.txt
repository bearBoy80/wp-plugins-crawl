The screenshot will be saved in your Media Library, and you will get a direct link to it to share. This will let you show how certain settings are, without giving them access to your backend.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on the other end (like a support agent) and you need to know how someone&#8217;s site settings without having to log in, tell your customer to install the plugin, take a screenshot of the page that you want to see, and send you the link.<\/p>\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Saves screenshots in Media Library<\/strong>: every image is saved in the \/admin-screenshots\/ subdirectory under \/uploads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Gives you direct link to images<\/strong>: immediately after taking the screenshot, you get the link to it, easy to copy to your clipboard and share with others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the &#8220;admin-screenshot&#8221; directory to your &#8220;wp-content\/plugins&#8221; directory.<\/li>\n<li>In your WordPress admin, go to PLUGINS and activate &#8220;Admin Screenshot&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Go to any page in your admin Dashboard.<\/li>\n<li>Select the &#8220;TAKE SCREENSHOT&#8221; button.<\/li>\n<li>Copy the link to the screenshot and share it with anyone.<\/li>\n<li>Party!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='some%20images%20are%20not%20showing%2C%20and%20some%20of%20the%20styles%20seem%20to%20be%20a%20bit%20off%20in%20the%20screenshots%2C%20esp.%20form%20elements%20%28input%20fields%2C%20dropdowns%2C%20etc.%29'>\nSome images are not showing, and some of the styles seem to be a bit off in the screenshots, esp. form elements (input fields, dropdowns, etc.)\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a known issue and is likely a bug in the original HTML2Canvas library that this plugin is built on.
