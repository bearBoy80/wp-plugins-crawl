During the import, a title (and post slug) was created for the post that looks like a large numerical value. I believe this is the original Blogger post ID, I guess the importer needed something to use.<\/p>\n<p>What this plugin does is replace those ugly numerical titles with the first few words of your post, like Blogger did. By simply enabling the plugin, any post that matches the ?ugly title? filter will have the title replaced by the first 48 characters of the post.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload all the files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/blogger-title-fix<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Configure the plugin in the Options admin tab.
