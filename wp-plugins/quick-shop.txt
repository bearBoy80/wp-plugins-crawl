Please tell it to redirect to a &#8216;Thank You&#8217; page in WordPress in the Core Form Admin \/ Email Options so that it has time to show that your cart is empty. All other options are also editable here so you can fine tune your email. I recommend turning Auto Confirmation on as well. Edit checkout.php email section to add new fields or change the default form used!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Upgrade Information<\/h4>\n<p>Activate the Quick Shop Updater plugin that is included with plugin to automatically upgrade all your old tags from Quick Shop v1 to v2. Once activated, visit the Tools &gt; Quick Shop Updater page to initiate the update process. The content of the Quick Shop tags in all posts and pages will be placed in the new inventory list and the tags will be updated to the new notation. The Quick Shop Updater plugin can then be deactivated and deleted.<\/p>\n<p>On WordPress MU, sitewide activation of the Quick Shop Updater plugin has <em>not<\/em> been tested!<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>How do I change the currency in Quick Shop?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You may now do it in the Quick Shop admin options page.
