No more headaches with the WordPress Cron or Action Schedulers dragging your site performance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to view and track checkout orders that originate Autoship and Product Subscriptions as well as orders created (via the WooCommerce REST API) from processing repeat Scheduled Orders.

The following new filters have been added to the plugin:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new <strong>&#8216;autoship_exclude_product_coupon_discounts_in_saleprice&#8217;<\/strong> filter has been added to the <strong>autoship_get_calculated_scheduled_order_item_sale_price()<\/strong> function in the <em>src\/scheduled-orders.php<\/em> file and passes a single boolean parameter which can be used to disable the inclusion of product-level coupon discounts in the displayed product price in the Native UI Display Option ( for displaying Scheduled Orders to customers in <em>My Account &gt; Scheduled Orders<\/em> )<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>= 2.3.4 &#8211;  2022-08-09<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved: the Checkout.com Payment gateway integration has been updated to create Scheduled Orders after completing a checkout using the <strong>&#8216;checkout_com_payment_captured&#8217;<\/strong> action which was newly added to the Checkout.com Payment Gateway plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: the <strong>autoship.pot<\/strong> file has been updated to include all new versions of the text strings displayed in the My Account, Product, and Cart pages.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: the Authorize.net refund metadata assigned to WooCommerce orders generated by QPilot has been updated to now include the charge captured value (&#8216;yes&#8217;) as well as all of the gateway response field names.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: Updated to load Autoship Cloud&#8217;s translated strings when the plugins loaded action fires.  Previously, starting in v1.2.38 a minimum version requirement check was added which inadvertently changed the load order of the plugin files and prevented the translated strings from being loaded.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>= 2.3.3 &#8211;  2022-07-06<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Updated to include the new order-shipping-rate-form.php file for the selectable Shipping Rates support that was added in v2.3.2.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>= 2.3.2 &#8211;  2022-06-28<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New!

Product data synchronization between WooCommerce Products and QPilot has been improved by including the Parent Product Id for WooCommerce Product Variations in the data sent to QPilot.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved!

The following new filters have been added to the plugin:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new <strong>&#8216;autoship_checkout_supported_payment_gateway_save_method_ids&#8217;<\/strong> filter has been added to the <strong>autoship_force_save_card()<\/strong> function in the <em>src\/checkout.php<\/em> file and can be used to filter the id&#8217;s of the save payment method checkout in the checkout form.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>= 2.2.8 &#8211; 2022-02-09<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: the Embedded App Display option has been updated to resolve an error that would occur when a customer would attempt to update a Scheduled Order and no timezone (UTC offset) was selected in the connected QPilot Site.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: the Embedded App Display option has been updated to resolve a 400 error that would occur when a customer would attempt to update the Next Occurrence Date on a Scheduled Order after the Processing End Time (defined on the connected QPilot Site) had already passed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>= 2.2.7 &#8211; 2022-01-28<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: the Embedded App Display option has been updated to work with the new Date\/Time format used by version 2.2.5+<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>= 2.2.6 &#8211; 2022-01-18<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved: the display of customer-facing notifications in the Native UI Display Option has been updated to use the customer-friendly version of the failure messages supplied by the QPilot API for lock window and order processing window validation errors.

Previously, starting in v2.2.5, these elements were no longer visible to customers.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: a Fatal Error that could occur in the <em>My Account &gt; Scheduled Orders<\/em> edit screen when attempting to add a product that has the &#8220;Sold Individually&#8221; flag selected (set in <em>WP-Admin &gt; Products &gt;&gt; Edit Product<\/em>) to an existing Scheduled Order.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>New Actions! The following new actions have been added to the plugin:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new &#8216;autoship_customer_user_metrics_refreshed&#8217; action is now available in the autoship_refresh_customer_metrics_for_user() function found in the src\/customers.php file and can be used to fire custom functions after the customer metrics data for a customer has been updated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>= 2.2.5 &#8211; 2021-12-29<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New! This update introduces a change to the Date\/Time format that is used for each Scheduled Order\u2019s Next Occurrence Date.  <strong>After updating the plugin, it is very important to run the additional action to update the Date\/Time format used for existing Scheduled Orders<\/strong>. After updating the plugin, admins will see an Important Notice to complete the upgrade process: <strong>&#8220;Update to Autoship Scheduled Orders Required!&#8221;<\/strong> When the <strong>Upgrade Processing Version<\/strong> button is clicked, existing Scheduled Orders will be updated to work with the new compatible Date\/Time format.<\/li>\n<li>New! Scheduled Orders can now include Time in their Next Occurrence Date.  For example: 2022-01-15 13:15:00<\/li>\n<li>New! A Customer Timezone can now be set for a Scheduled Order! This new setting helps with integrations that want to display the Date for upcoming Scheduled Orders in the timezone that the customer is in.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>New! Merchants can now set a Start Time and End Time for Site Processing to control when Scheduled Orders can be automatically processed.  The Autoship Cloud plugin has been updated so that the integration with QPilot will take into account the Scheduled Order Processing Start and End time ( set within your connected QPilot Site  <strong><em>Qpilot &gt; Edit Site &gt; Options ( tab )<\/em><\/strong> ).  If a Next Occurrence date-time falls outside the site&#8217;s Processing Start and End Time, it will be automatically adjusted to the Scheduled Order Processing Start time.  The following functionality has been updated to take the Scheduled Order Processing Start and End time into account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How the Relative Next Occurrence date and time is calculated when the \u201cSet Next Occurrence Date Relative to Checkout\u201d feature is set a product in the <strong><em>WP-Admin &gt; Edit Product &gt; Autoship ( tab )<\/em><\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>How the Next Occurrence date and time is calculated when using the Create Scheduled Order shortcode.<\/li>\n<li>How the Next Occurrence date and time is set when using the Update Schedule functionality in the <strong><em>My Account &gt; Edit Scheduled Order<\/em><\/strong> screen on the native Autoship Scheduled Orders template.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved! The performance of the Edit Scheduled Order(s) screen when using the Native UI display option (viewable by customers in the <em>My Account &gt; Scheduled Orders<\/em> screen) now loads faster by caching the Site Settings options retrieved from the QPilot API.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Improved: The integration of the Autoship Cloud plugin with the WooCommerce Cart by updating the <strong>superglobal<\/strong> used from the <strong>$_REQUEST<\/strong> variable to the <strong>$_POST<\/strong> variable to apply the Schedule to the cart items.  This allows developers to customize the <strong>$_POST<\/strong> variable during the Add to Cart call.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: The Offset Processing feature that enables you to process Scheduled Orders days in advance of their Next Occurrence Dates has been improved so that Customers will see that their upcoming Scheduled Order&#8217;s status is \u201cProcessing\u201d during the day(s) ahead of their Next Occurrence Date.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: The Lock Duration feature has been updated to work with the new Date\/Time format and also improves the customer experience by showing customers that their Scheduled Order is \u201cProcessing\u201d during the time that they are not allowed to make changes. This way your customers see that their Scheduled Order is processing all the way up until their Next Occurrence Date, and are free to make changes only after the Scheduled Order has completed processing.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>New Filters! The following new filters have been added to the plugin:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new <strong>&#8216;autoship_site_settings_expiration_duration&#8217;<\/strong> filter has been added to the new autoship_get_remote_site_settings() function found in the <em>src\/admin.php<\/em> file and can be used adjust the expiration duration used for caching the QPilot Site Settings values in the WordPress database.<\/li>\n<li>A new <strong>&#8216;autoship_create_scheduled_order_next_occurrence_offset&#8217;<\/strong> filter has been added to the autoship_get_scheduled_order_data () function found in the <em>src\/orders.php<\/em> file and can be used adjust the utcOffset value assigned to Scheduled Orders created and upserted to QPilot.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>New Actions!

The Autoship Cloud Logging system is useful for troubleshooting issues with your Autoship Cloud and QPilot Integration.

For example, if a Site was connected to QPilot previously using https:\/\/www.mysite.com, it can be reconnected to QPilot using the URL https:\/\/mysite.com and be recognized as the same site.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: The action to \u201cExport WC Autoship Schedules to CSV\u201d found in WP-Admin &gt; Autoship Cloud &gt; Migrations has been improved to include the export of Autoship Schedules that do not contain products and\/or saved payment data.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: QPilot\u2019s automated Product Synchronization will no longer updated and change the Product Type for a WooCommerce Product.

Merchants can now define a value for Processing Offset for their connected QPilot Site.  This new feature enables Scheduled Orders to begin processing ahead of their Next Occurrence date.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: Scheduled Orders including coupons that apply shipping discounts will now include the coupon on the created WooCommerce Order.  Previously, no coupon would be included with the WooCommerce Order if it only applied a discount to the Shipping Rate.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: Issue where shipping rates were not recalculating and updating consistently when processing Scheduled Orders.  This issue would cause some Scheduled Orders to apply an incorrect shipping rate if not all items were valid or in stock when the Scheduled Order processed.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: Conflicts with other plugins that also hook into requests to create Orders via the WooCommerce REST API.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>New Actions!

Support for refunds is coming soon for additional supported payment gateways.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: Automatic product synchronization has been improved to handle errors that may occur during the sync process.  Previously, the automated product sync could be completely halted by a site that had errors and this has been improved moving forward.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: Scheduled Orders that have a 0.00 subtotal can now be processed with QPilot.  Previously, Scheduled Orders for 0.00 would fail because the amount is invalid for payment processing.  This is now improved so that 0.00 Scheduled Orders do not attempt to process a payment.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: the \u201cInvalid\u201d filter on the Autoship Cloud &gt; Products report will now return only products with that are \u201cActive\u201d status.  This ensure that only products that are activated for Autoship in WooCommerce are flagged as invalid.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: the Bulk Update actions (in WP-Admin &gt; Autoship Cloud &gt; Migrations) have been improved to handle site errors.  Previously, site errors would cause a bulk update to stop or timeout without notice.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: the Bulk Update actions (in WP-Admin &gt; Autoship Cloud &gt; Migrations) have been improved to handle Simple products that have orphaned variations.  Previously, a simple product might be skipped during the bulk update if invalid variations exist in the database and include the simple product as a parent product.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: Product synchronization warnings now correctly display a \u201cYellow Sync Warning\u201d icon.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Empty Order Notes were being added to WooCommerce Orders.

The action includes the Payment Gateway response and the WC_Order object as parameters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.41<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New: Autoship Cloud now interprets Coupons applied to Scheduled Orders as Coupons for WooCommerce Orders.  Previously, Coupons on Scheduled Orders could only be included as Fee Line items on orders created in WooCommerce and this would sometimes result in inaccurate tax rate calculations.\n<ul>\n<li>The new functionality checks for the existence of Coupon Fee Lines in Orders created in WooCommerce by QPilot via the WC REST API and does the following:<\/li>\n<li>Removes the Coupon Fee Lines and stores them into a _qpilot_legacy_fee_lines metadata field on the WooCommerce Order so that the Coupon Fee Lines can always be re-applied programmatically if needed as well as for auditing purposes.<\/li>\n<li>Each Coupon Fee Line is converted to a \u201cvirtual\u201d coupon via the new autoship_generate_virtual_wc_coupon() function. See the WooCommerce documentation for the virtual flag here. These virtual coupons are also stored with the Order in a new _qpilot_dynamic_coupons metadata field so that they can be applied in the future.<\/li>\n<li>After the order is created in WooCommerce, the virtual coupons are re-applied one by one, letting WooCommerce calculate taxes, re-calculate totals, and deal with rounding natively on the line item level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>New: Added a new Option within WP-Admin &gt; Autoship Cloud &gt; Settings to \u201cDisplay QPilot Coupons as Fee Lines\u201d in case a merchant prefers to limit Coupons included on Scheduled Orders to Fee Line items instead of using the new Coupon Fee Lines functionality.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>New: Added a new Option for WooCommerce Products activated for Autoship to override the default Next Occurrence behavior and choose to \u201cSet Next Occurrence Date Relative to Checkout\u201d.  This enables merchants to choose a number of Days, Weeks or Months after Checkout for when the Scheduled Order created for this product should be scheduled for (also known as the \u201cnext occurrence date\u201d).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: Removed old functions within Checkout.php that would cause some sites to send an incorrect Stock Status for products that allow backorders.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>New Filters! The following New Filters have been added:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>autoship_qpilot_orders_via_rest filter has been added to the autoship_qpilot_orders_update() callback function for the Autoship Orders endpoint in src\\api.php. This filter can be used to adjust the rest request data coming in through the endpoint prior to the call to WC_REST_Orders_Controller::create_item().<\/li>\n<li>autoship_qpilot_orders_via_rest_enable_fee_lines filter has been added to the autoship_qpilot_orders_update_via_rest_convert_fees_to_coupons() function in src\\coupons.php. This filter can be used to disable the virtual coupons functionality and re-enable the legacy fee line method for QPilot orders coming in on the Rest API.<\/li>\n<li>autoship_qpilot_orders_update_via_rest_apply_coupons filter has been added to the autoship_qpilot_orders_update_via_rest_apply_coupons() function in src\\coupons.php. This filter can be used to disable \/ enable the virtual coupons functionality by order for orders coming in on the Rest API.<\/li>\n<li>autoship_rest_generated_virtual_wc_coupons filter has been added to the autoship_qpilot_orders_update_via_rest_convert_fees_to_coupons() function in src\\coupons.php. This filter can be used to adjust the virtual coupons generated from the fee lines on the rest order.<\/li>\n<li>autoship_generated_virtual_wc_coupon filter has been added to the autoship_generate_virtual_wc_coupon() function in src\\coupons.php. This filter can be used to adjust a virtual coupon as it&#8217;s generated and perform other tasks related to that coupon.<\/li>\n<li>autoship_coupon_types_by_code filter has been added to the autoship_get_coupon_type_by_code() function in src\\coupons.php. This filter can be used to adjust how QPilot Coupon Types are converted to WC Coupon types.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.40<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Issue where a Notice was being displayed incorrectly due to a reference to a legacy $error variable that was removed when the product metadata summary was refactored.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Issue when updating WooCommerce Products that allow backorders was sending an Out of Stock status for the product or variation to QPilot.  Products and variations that allow backorders now consistently send an InStock stock status to QPilot.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Issue where Stock QTY was sending an AbsInt value for the stock level which means that the stock level was always sent as a positive number.  This has been corrected so that Out of Stock and backordered products can send a negative number value for stock level.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: Issue with Autoship Sync was not updating the product type correctly or including the parent ID for product variations.  The automatic sync process has been updated to so that product type synchronizes consistently and includes the parent ID for product variations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>New Actions! The following New Actions have been added:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>autoship_after_print_product_custom_fields action has been added to the autoship_print_product_custom_fields() function in src\/product-page.php to allow developers to extend the Autoship Options on the Edit Product screen.<\/li>\n<li>autoship_after_print_variable_product_custom_fields_group action has been added to the autoship_print_variable_product_custom_fields() function in src\/product-page.php to allow developers to extend the Autoship Options on the Edit Product &gt; Variations tab.<\/li>\n<li>autoship_after_print_variable_product_custom_fields action has been added to the autoship_print_variable_product_custom_fields() function in src\/product-page.php to allow developers to extend the Autoship Options on the Edit Product &gt; Variations tab.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved Filters: The following Filters have been improved:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>autoship_total_product_summary_data action has been improved in the autoship_get_product_sync_summary() function in src\/products.php to include a new summaries parameter that allows developers to use the QPilot API response in functions filtering the summary data.<\/li>\n<li>autoship_total_variation_product_summary_data action has been improved in the autoship_get_product_sync_summary() function in src\/products.php to include a new summaries parameter that allows developers to use the QPilot API response in functions filtering the summary data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.39<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved: Updated the API Health Check notification within WP-Admin &gt; Autoship Cloud &gt; Settings to show &#8220;UnHealthy&#8221; if any API tests return an unexpected error. This ensures that site owners are aware of errors that their site returns when an API request is made.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: Scheduled Order Attribution data has been expanded to track how many Scheduled Orders are expected to be created from an Autoship Checkout versus how many are actually linked to the WooCommerce Order.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: The Autoship discount string has been updated so that it shows the recurring price instead of a &#8220;0&#8221; when a recurring price is entered and no checkout discount price.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.38<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>New! Scheduled Order Attribution has been added to WooCommerce Order data.  This enalbes merchants to quickly see when a WooCommerce Order contains products that are selected for Autoship as well as review which Scheduled Order(s) were created as a result.  We&#8217;ve also added notifications that will warn merchants if a Scheduled Order was expected to be created but does not appear to be associated with the WooCommerce Order.  In addition the following two functions have been added specifically to find the source of a WC Order generated by QPilot<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>autoship_get_scheduled_order_wc_source_id() function which takes the QPilot order ID and returns the ID for the original WC Order from which the Scheduled order was created.<\/li>\n<li>autoship_get_wc_order_source_id() function which takes a WC Order ID or WC_Order object for an order generated by QPilot and returns the ID for the original WC Order from which the Scheduled order was created.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: An alert for &#8220;WooCommerce Required&#8221; will display in the WP-Admin when the WooCommerce plugin is not active.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Improved: Orders.php has been organized to the same standard as product.php and product-page.php so that developers can more easily find, use, and understand the plugin functions.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: Scheduled Order display options and active autoship cloud extensions now synchronize their settings with other site metadata in QPilot in order to better track usage of customizations and extension usage.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: The &#8220;!&#8221; warning badge displayed in the WP-Admin Menu (WP-Admin &gt; Autoship Cloud) was not clearing after issues were resolved.

Products that are activated for Autoship Sync now display a warning indicator when a product is not synchronized with QPilot within 48 hours.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: A warning indicator will now be displayed on the Autoship Cloud menu and Autoship Cloud Products Submenu options when one or more Invalid products exist in QPilot.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: PayPal (Express) Checkout now does not require customers to create PayPal Billing Agreements for one-time purchases during WooCommerce checkout.  Previously, the Autoship Cloud plugin was enforcing the Billing Agreement workflow regardless if any products were selected or Autoship.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.36<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: Units of measurement for WooCommerce Products can now be synchronized with QPilot when the unit of measurement is unique to a specific WooCommerce Product or Variation. The following filters are now available to adjust the unit of measurement for weight and dimensions on a product by product basis: the \u2018autoship_get_mapped_product_weight_unit&#8217; filter can be used to supply QPilot with the weight unit of measurement for a product and the \u2018autoship_get_mapped_product_length_unit\u2019 filter can be used to supply QPilot with the dimension unit of measurement for a product.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: Issue with the Bulk Update Autoship Recurring price action where only the first batch of WooCommerce products were updated.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Updated support for WooCommerce PayPal Checkout version 1.6.16 and resolved issue where Smart Button payments were not functioning at WooCommerce Checkout<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: Issue where selecting &#8220;Update and Sync&#8221; after editing a WooCommerce Product would cause the browser to alert users about unsaved changes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.35<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: Resolved a ReferenceError that occurs on the Edit Product page for Non-Active products starting in version 1.2.32 which prevents the ability to Edit variations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: A warning modal will now be displayed when a user clicks on the &#8220;Edit&#8221; link to change the Status of a Product or the visibility of a product and that product is currently being synchronized with QPilot.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.34<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Resolved issue in version 1.2.32 where the Next Occurrence date was not being assigned to Scheduled Orders correctly and prevented Scheduled Orders from being created at checkout.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.33<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: The &#8220;Update WooCommerce Product Synchronization&#8221; bulk action will now correctly Activate any products with Autoship options enabled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2.32<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New!

I can say that confidently. No autoship plugin compares.\n\nLet's just say that we have an incredibly complicated business model, and we're fitting it all into a Woocommerce site. So much of our business is dependent on autoship, and an autoship process that is painless. Beyond that, we had a need for product MAP (first occurrence is one SKU, then we need it to automatically switch to another). Autoship Cloud now does that inherently. The user interface is great, and everything just makes sense.\n\nBut a great plugin can be mediocre if there isn't impeccable support to back it up. I appreciate a well-thought-out, thorough email. Autoship Cloud's support literally has the BEST support email structure. Bulleted, clear, concise, and they respond FAST. If you really need more help, you can have a video call with a member of their team. They're great people, and they work to get you the easiest and cheapest solution. If you need something custom, they are extremely reasonable to hire to build that in. We had them do a little project for us, and it was painless and works perfectly.\n\nJust get this plugin if you are needing autoship. Don't even look at another. \n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Amazing Customer Service!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/thetwocrazycatladies\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/99fbda51f7a596f110649150a305dc99?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/99fbda51f7a596f110649150a305dc99?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/thetwocrazycatladies\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">thetwocrazycatladies<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 28, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">We've been considering Autoship for a couple years but could never find a plugin that would work for our business model.

I strongly advise you to stay away from inputing your card information. \n\nI have emailed the developers about this, but have not gotten a response.<\/del>\n\nUPDATE: They emailed me back and have cancelled my account. Apparently you can not cancel online, you'll have to email them. It's usually a big warning sign when services don't let you cancel online.. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Awesome, Just Awesome!

They are very clear when they send emails, allowing anyone, regardless of technical knowledge, to understand what's going to, and what they need to do. As a system administrator, I have never had to deal with a company that is this good before.\n\nNot just that, they always personally email you back, to see how you went doing any change or modification, cause they do actually care.\n\nThank you for allowing our business to grow!\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/autoship-cloud.2.5.01.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/autoship-cloud\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1799183","caption":"\u201cSubscribe and Save\u201d is quick to offer for any product or variation.
