But I&#8217;ve never really felt using that SEO tool well as I am not an SEO expert and don&#8217;t have the time to invest too many hours learning about SEO optimization.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why Squirrly came in to help me with that process: I like their guide and the steps explaining what to do next in order to get it working. That&#8217;s great for me!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gabriel Santos<\/strong>(testimonial source: Product Hunt)<\/p>\n<h3>Powerful yet Lightweight &#8211; Squirrly SEO loads faster than any other SEO plugin<\/h3>\n<p>The Squirrly SEO plugin doesn&#8217;t impact your pagespeed &#8211; as it loads super fast with a WordPress site.<\/p>\n<p>(demonstrated in the LIVE TEST below)<\/p>\n<p><strong><a title=\"SEE LIVE SPEED TEST\" href=\"https:\/\/howto12.squirrly.co\/faq\/is-squirrly-seo-a-heavy-plugin\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See how fast Squirrly really is.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The advantage that enables Squirrly SEO to load faster than any other SEO plugin currently on the market:<\/p>\n<p><strong>This amazing feat is thanks to the SaaS + SEO plugin duality which is unique to Squirrly SEO<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>650 Features in Squirrly SEO, but the processing and heavy lifting is done on Squirrly Limited (the company)\u2019s private servers. That makes the WordPress SEO plugin load incredibly fast.<\/p>\n<p>Also, from our tests, the Squirrly SEO plugin loads on the frontend in 0.005s if you\u2019re not using a plugin for caching.<\/p>\n<p>We integrated the Squirrly SEO plugin with the most popular plugins for caching like WP Super Cache, WP-Rocket, Autoptimize, W3 Total, and more. This way, the buffer only loads through the plugins for caching and the speed is not affected at all.<\/p>\n<h3>SEO feels like a dark art? With Squirrly, you don&#8217;t have to do it alone<\/h3>\n<p>With so many variables at play, SEO can seem blindingly complex.<\/p>\n<p>Like you&#8217;re trying to solve one huge puzzle, and it&#8217;s up to you to try and make sense of how all the pieces fit together.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to get overwhelmed by the breadth of knowledge and attention to detail necessary.<\/p>\n<p>So many people end up putting SEO off over and over.<\/p>\n<p>Not if you&#8217;re using Squirrly.<\/p>\n<p>With features such as <strong>Next SEO Goals<\/strong> and <strong>Focus Pages<\/strong>, Squirrly helps you navigate today&#8217;s key ranking factors by providing you with a complete framework and step-by-step guidance for placing your pages at the top of Google Search.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like having an SEO expert in your WordPress site telling you what to do next to rank higher.<\/p>\n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br \/>\n&#8221; I&#8217;m new to SEO and, to be honest, it felt a bit like jabbing into the dark, having no real idea how optimized my content is (or isn&#8217;t). But with Squirrly&#8217;s content editor, it&#8217;s crystal clear what I need to do to rank.<\/p>\n<p>After following its guidelines and rewriting some of my articles, one of them showed up on the first page of Google! &#8220;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a small win but one that gives me absolute confidence that if I put in the work, I&#8217;ll get the SEO results I&#8217;m hoping for in due time.<\/p>\n<p>Though, there is A LOT more to this tool than just the content editor. It really covers pretty much everything you need to do for on-page SEO stuff.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re new to SEO like I am, I suggest grabbing this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Victor Mutta<\/strong> (testimonial source: Product Hunt)<\/p>\n<h3>Get actionable steps for topping the search engine rankings using the power of AI<\/h3>\n<p>Intimidated by SEO and its complexity?<\/p>\n<p>Instead of feeling overwhelmed, you could start each day with a <strong>simple set of actionable Goals ready for you to complete<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Squirrly gives you clear directions and a step-by-step approach to implementing best practices for WordPress SEO.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, it breaks everything down for you into small chunks and actionable tasks so nothing gets overwhelming.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is follow the guidance to solve tasks and turn as many RED elements GREEN. It&#8217;s really that simple.<\/p>\n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br \/>\n&#8221; Squirrly is a great SEO plugin and I&#8217;ve tested quite a few SEO plugins, including Rank Math, SEO Press and Yoast. Their whole approach is different but somehow has the same important aspects. It works great! &#8220;<\/p>\n<p>The focus feature is especially useful and I now include Squirrly on all my sites to get rankings on specific pages. Onboarding is a breeze as well and they have a step by step process to help you reach your SEO goals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Muhammed Seitz<\/strong> (Web Developer)<\/p>\n<p>(testimonial source: Product Hunt)<\/p>\n<h3>Reach the 1st Page of Google and actually have Fun getting there<\/h3>\n<p>You know SEO is important but just hearing the word optimize makes you want to gouge your eyes out?

I had fun finding keywords and working with them inside the tool and the way squirrly teaches you what to improve is fantastic.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I discovered things I never quite understood under seopress because you don\u2019t tweak it.

I have been using WordPress for many years and have always used different plugins for SEO and was not aware of Squirrly. I was loyal to another SEO plugin, but after finding the offer on AppSumo and trying it on several of my sites, I must say that it is a complete and easy-to-use plugin. I use it on English, Spanish, and Italian websites. The Italian side still needs to improve a bit because sometimes it takes keywords that make little sense, but the simplicity of inserting links within the article and recommended anchors speeds up my work, especially on some of my sites self-managed by artificial intelligence. Definitely a plugin not to be missed.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Wordpress SEO Beast!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/lamb92009\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/58801056aa11263d48ccbcff9dd94a6a?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/58801056aa11263d48ccbcff9dd94a6a?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/lamb92009\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">lamb92009<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 9, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">If you\u2019ve ever struggled getting pages to rank, this tool will surprise you.
