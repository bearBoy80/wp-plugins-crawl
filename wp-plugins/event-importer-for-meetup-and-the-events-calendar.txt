This plugin will not do anything without it!<\/p>\n<p>This plugin relies on WP Cron to run the import on a schedule, so it will not work if you have disabled WP Cron (sometimes this is done in wp-config.php).<\/p>\n<p>After you have both plugins installed, you need to configure a couple of settings. First navigate to Events -&gt; Import in your Dashboard. From there you can input your <a href=\"https:\/\/secure.meetup.com\/meetup_api\/key\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Meetup.com API Key<\/a> and choose the post status that should be used for imports.<\/p>\n<p>Next, click on the &#8220;Meetup.com&#8221; tab. From there you can fill in the URL for a Meetup group, select the Event Categories you want it to be mapped to, and hit &#8220;Add Recurring Import&#8221;. This will schedule a script to run twice a day to import the upcoming events from that group into The Events Calendar. You can add as many groups as you&#8217;d like.<\/p>\n<p><em>This is an early release of this plugin, so it&#8217;s a little barebones.

By integrating with Events Calendar this plugin avoids a lot of those issues by focusing on simply importing the events and letting the events calendar do the rest. Being able to have the venues synced and shown on Google maps, the organizer picked up automatically and a bunch of touches like this make this a job well done!<\/p>\n<p>If I may impose here, I would love to see a way to do the following:<br \/>\n- Import old events<br \/>\n- An option to have to toggle that imported events will set the flags to show the google map and link\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/event-importer-for-meetup-and-the-events-calendar.0.3.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/event-importer-for-meetup-and-the-events-calendar\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1380767","caption":"On the main import settings screen you can set your Meetup.com API Key and the default status of imported events."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/event-importer-for-meetup-and-the-events-calendar\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1380767","caption":"On the Meetup.com import tab, you can set up recurring imports.
