By any chance, a start up can not afford the annual license fee then they can pay a 8% commission fee for every transaction until they can afford the annual license fee. We put a lot of time and effort in developing this plugin and continue to develop. This is our way to make sure those who want a powerful plugin that calculates 3d prints can do so without making an upfront financial commitment.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nDoes the plugin support all types of 3D Printers?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin calculates volume and density information of a STL 3D file.
