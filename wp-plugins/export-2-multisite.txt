It handles duplicate users (based on email) and will copy over all site settings including Widgets and Menus. You still need to copy the files for your themes, plugins and uploads.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>This plugin has been minimally tested, but has been used to successfully migrate a handful of standalone sites to a multisite installation.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>There is a good possibility it won&#8217;t work for sites that make use of a multitude of plugins &#8211; especially plugins that have their own database tables.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Installation<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new site on the Multisite.<\/li>\n<li>Copy the plugins and themes from this standalone site to the Multisite.<\/li>\n<li>Copy the files from wp-content\/uploads\/ on this site to wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/\/ on the multisite.<\/li>\n<li>Backup the database on the Multisite.<\/li>\n<li>Provide the Site ID of the Multisite. This can be found by hovering the mouse over the new site on Network Admin-&gt;Sites.<\/li>\n<li>Provide the New URL.

So only perform this migration on new empty Sites.<\/li>\n<li>Note that the you may need to review the exported SQL to ensure that plugin database tables have been exported correctly.<\/li>\n<li>The site admin (username and password) is the user you created while creating the new Site, NOT the site admin of this standalone site.<\/li>\n<li>The guts of this export plugin were inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/iandunn.name\/comprehensive-wordpress-multisite-migrations\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this blog post<\/a><\/li>\n<li>The code for this plugin has been modified from the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-migrate-db\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Migrate DB<\/a> plugin, but should not conflict with it in any way.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Use WordPress&#8217; built-in installer<\/li>\n<li>Access the &#8220;Export 2 Multisite&#8221; menu option under the Tools menu<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>I&#8217;m not a developer, can I use this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably not. You&#8217;re going to need some technical experience to migrate your site properly.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I import the file I downloaded into my WP Multisite?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will need access to a database client that can perform writes to your WP database. You can use PHPMyAdmin, or run the raw SQL on the commandline using the <em>mysql<\/em> client and running the <em>source<\/em> command.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I download the images and files in my media library so I can upload them to my multisite?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need access to your server to get these files easily. Use FTP or SSH into your server to zip wp-content\/uploads so you can download to your Multisite server. You could also make use of the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/all-in-one-wp-migration\/\" rel=\"ugc\">All-in-One WP Migration plugin<\/a> to export just the files.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I make sure the correct themes and plugins are setup on my multisite?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s likely easiest to just freshly install the themes and plugins on your Multisite. If you have a custom theme or plugin on your standalone site, you will need to copy it over the same way you copied your media files.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Will a future version of this plugin make it easier for me to export my media files, themes and plugins?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p><em>Maybe<\/em>. This plugin was created in haste to tackle a problem that wasn&#8217;t already solved by some other plugin like the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-migrate-db\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Migrate DB<\/a> plugin or the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/all-in-one-wp-migration\/\" rel=\"ugc\">All-in-One WP Migration plugin<\/a> plugin. These plugins both suggest they have a PRO version coming that offers multisite migration. This plugin will always remain Free however.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>In Advanced Options there is now a way to supply the database prefix of the target multisite (in case it&#8217;s not wp_).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The first release of this plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Working \u043e\u043a<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dimagsv\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b12c79c6e0f5cd0a4be5b5706d460169?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b12c79c6e0f5cd0a4be5b5706d460169?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dimagsv\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">dimagsv<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>Good useful plugin!\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/export-2-multisite.0.2.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"database":"database","export":"export","migrate":"migrate","multisite":"multisite","mysql":"mysql"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/export-2-multisite.0.1.zip","0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/export-2-multisite.0.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/export-2-multisite.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
