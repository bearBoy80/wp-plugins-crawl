I've left my original review below and will be adding this updated review:\n\nInitially I had issues getting this plugin to work. I kept getting skipped imports due to duplicate content, failed imports due to date\/time issues, and just plain old frustration. Part of this was due to no real information in regards to importing events on the dev's site.\n\nAs you can see in the comments below, they responded pretty quickly. I contacted their support and within 24 hours had a response with some details to help aid me. I followed their info but still encountered issues with the date\/time. I would fix the date\/time on the CSV but still kept getting errors on the import.\n\nSo I dug deeper into the Numbers app (Mac) and found that by default it set the date\/time format in specific manner, so even when I changed it, it still defaulted. So I dug deeper and was able to set the format to what I wanted, and bingo, all was well.\n\nSo I have to offer an apology on my part for jumping the gun. I should have contacted them first instead of leaving a review first.\n\nThe conclusion is that this plugin does work and does import duplicate events with different dates\/times. Also if you get stuck, reach out to the devs first.\n\n\n\n*************************************************************************************\nRequires you to download a second plugin, WP All Import, in order to work. Even after downloading that plugin, it forces you through several unnecessary steps that still won't work. \n\nInstead of creating the events, it tried to combine the 38 events into one and then failed.\n\nThis should be a straightforward and easy import\/new event creation action but it's not. Neither plugin can handle events with the same title or event start\/end date\/time.\n\nNeeds some serious improvement.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sugar-calendar-wp-all-import.1.0.1.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":[],"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sugar-calendar-wp-all-import.1.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sugar-calendar-wp-all-import.1.0.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sugar-calendar-wp-all-import.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sugar-calendar-wp-all-import\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2290125","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sugar-calendar-wp-all-import\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2290125"}}
