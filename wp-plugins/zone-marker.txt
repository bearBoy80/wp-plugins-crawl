You could be a drone pilot who need to know the exact location of where you need to video, or it could be some boundary issue that needs highlighting or a crop to spray.<br \/>\nZone Marker enables the website user to mark out the exact area that is under discussion, then emails the details to the site admin so you can view the area and make informed decisions on how to proceed. This could be to formulate a quote or just to help make plans.<br \/>\nUse the shortcode [zonemarker] in your page or post.<\/p>\n<h3>Pro Version<\/h3>\n<p>This is still in development.
