We use best practices to cautiously update your website scripts to load after your markup has completed loading.<\/p>\n<p>Our plugin also has the ability to defer scripts that are inline which tend to cause trouble when you defer their dependent scripts. We do this to ensure that your inline scripts will not break functionality on your site, while allowing you to benefit from the performance gains.<\/p>\n<h3>Deferring CSS and Javascript Plugin Settings<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to exclude specific and critical CSS files<\/li>\n<li>Toggle deferring inline Javascript<\/li>\n<li>Toggle deferring jQuery<\/li>\n<li>Ability to exclude specific and critical Javascript files<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How to ignore a critical CSS or Javascript file<\/h3>\n<p>Under the Tools section in the wp-admin of your site you will find a submenu \u201cDefer CSS &amp; Javascript\u201d.
