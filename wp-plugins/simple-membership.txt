It's literally the ONLY LEGIT plugin that allows you to get paid for YOUR content without extorting you for large amounts of money. Other plugins want you to pay them in order for you to be paid and that is literal extortion. As an author of a chapter serial blog I need something that will protect my content and earn me money for that content without bugging my site up with ads. There are other free plugins will protect your content but will also reveal it once they subscribe and you still won't make any money unless you buy their $200+ pro plan. Extortion. And most chapter serial apps like Wattpad, RoyalRoad, ect won't pay you either unless you're \"popular\" by their standards i.e. expecting you to give away your hard earned work for FREE. Authors deserve to be paid for their efforts and this app is A++ for that. Needs more recognition for being the best plugin in this category than all the others. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Very good add on - simple to setup and use<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mitch66\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/41b398b09680da1067d0fa8861ba73a4?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/41b398b09680da1067d0fa8861ba73a4?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mitch66\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">mitch66<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 11, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">This is a very good add on<br \/>It was simple to setup and use and did exactly what I wanted to protect access to my website without being too intrusive.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Good plugin, but it could be really great if the developers did it differently<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/davidgroh\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/65d764c6af1112f2109c37051b349c53?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/65d764c6af1112f2109c37051b349c53?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/davidgroh\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">davidgroh<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 9, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Good plugin for being free. Thus, it can cover 80% of needs. But the fact is that this plugin is not ready for larger projects.

If this is where your members go after logging in they see a vertically stacked menu\/navigation that's not very useful. I had to create a separate \"Home\" page area for the Member Area. <br \/><br \/>*** 2) Having the ablility to place a Logout link anywhere you'd like could be very useful for the average person who doesn't realize how to recreate their own. Yes, I know about the 'Logout when window closes option'. <br \/><br \/>*** 3) My biggest problem with this plugin is the Direct Email Function to Members is not working for me. I've tried several times and I'm not receiving anything in my inbox or spam. It's not sending email notifications to new users once I change their account from Pending to Active. <br \/><br \/>Other than that, it works. <br \/>I'm happy with what I've managed to get in place and working. Just a few minor things to fix and I'd give it a 5 Star Review.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Deleted admin account<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/nesdam1981\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6c6968207972ace098fe32ff763988ba?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6c6968207972ace098fe32ff763988ba?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/nesdam1981\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Sirmadsen <small>(Nesdam1981)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 30, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">I don't really know where to start, this plugin is one of the worst I have ever used.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">First of all, there is no protection what so ever. This plugin can literally delete your admin account!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">So, I installed this plugin because my theme have built in support for it (I will highly recommend no theme developer to use this plugin), so far so good. The first thing I notice is that adding protection is fairly simple but requires several steps, weird but OK. So I set up the protection, create a free plan which is what I want, again, so far so good. Now I notice that there is no way to move members manually into the created plans, this require an entirely different plugin, because why add that vital function into the base plugin? That would actually be user friendly. Then I notice that I as admin and post author cannot read my own articles if they are set as protected!!! Why!? I'm the effin author and ADMIN!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">OK, so I go through the hassle and install Another plugin just to be able to \"import\" myself into the free plan... Nope, still couldn't read my own articles. I don't know why but I suspect that this plugin is so badly coded that it actually only works for new members.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">So, I want to do some testing and want to REMOVE myself from the plan. Because obviously a plugin should not be coded in such a way that it DELETES accounts, right? Nope, REMOVING accounts from a plan literally DELETES them from your site, this includes admin accounts.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">So no I have no access and have to go through PHPmyadmin process to add back my admin account.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">It's safe to say that plugin is malicious and should be (if you must) used with extreme caution.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">I'm going to report the plugin to Wordpress as well as recommending my themes developer to remove support and use another plugin.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Super<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dada80\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0e4e11ec5f605c4129e4551e40734f48?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0e4e11ec5f605c4129e4551e40734f48?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dada80\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">dada80<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 29, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Super<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Simple y Maravilloso<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/esvannye\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/973e44cf6d4aadd5f0e5545bc078d48d?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/973e44cf6d4aadd5f0e5545bc078d48d?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/esvannye\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">esvannye<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 26, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">He instalado recientemente este plugin, es simple, se entiende muy sencillo.
