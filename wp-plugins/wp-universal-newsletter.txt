For those that check the &#8216;Use current theme&#8217;s single.php file&#8217; option, you MUST use the raw URL to send an HTML email. If you do not check that option, you can use either the normal or the raw URL.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How can I make my newsletter content conform to my site&#8217;s theme when viewed in the browser?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>See the &#8216;Use current theme&#8217;s single.php file&#8217; option. You&#8217;ll have to know some php, and you can create the folder called &#8216;wpun_templates&#8217; in your active theme and add a wpun_single.php file there to override the plugins wpun_single.php file. Its recommended to  copy the plugins wpun_single.php as a starting point.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What newsletter services does this plugin work with?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any newsletter service that allows you to import html from a URL, such as Mailchimp, iContact. Also any service that allows you to paste in raw HTML Into a WYSIWYG editor, like Constant Contact.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>My newsletter is not loading correctly after I save and view it, whats happening?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try re-saving the permalinks in WordPress Settings&gt;Permalinks&gt;Update Permalinks. Or if you are using a caching plugin, like W3Cache, trying clearing it.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How to I create a button?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the WYSIWYG, you can simply highlight the text you wish to turn into a button, use the link icon in the tool bar, and check the option to &#8216;Make Button&#8217;. That&#8217;s it! Remember to configure your button styles in Settings&gt;WP Universal Newsletter<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Where are the p and div tags going?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>These 2 types of tags are problematic when used in HTML emails. Email clients, like hotmail and yahoo, will often add their own styles to these tags, if present, such as paddings and margins. This will cause inconsistency in the layout across email clients, and in an effort to normalize the look, we made the decision to remove them.  As of version 1.1, <code>&lt;p&gt;<\/code> tags are now converted to table tags in an effort to preserve any inline styles that may have been added to the original <code>&lt;p&gt;<\/code> tag.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Clean up README.txt<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert <code>&lt;p&gt;<\/code> tags into <code>&lt;table&gt;<\/code> tags instead of removing completely; Additionally preserve inline styles of the <code>&lt;p&gt;<\/code> tag and place them in the <code>&lt;td&gt;<\/code> for more granular style control.<\/li>\n<li>Fix Outlook conditional statement from breaking if more than one button was added to the page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix mismatching nonce name-spaces when saving post meta fields, causing meta fields saving failures.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-universal-newsletter\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1396043\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-universal-newsletter\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1396043\" alt=\"Settings Screen\"><\/a><p>Settings Screen<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-universal-newsletter\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1396043\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-universal-newsletter\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1396043\" alt=\"Newsletter Edit Screen\"><\/a><p>Newsletter Edit Screen<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-universal-newsletter\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1396043\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-universal-newsletter\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1396043\" alt=\"HTML Optimized Result\"><\/a><p>HTML Optimized Result<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Easy to use!
