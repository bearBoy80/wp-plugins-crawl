You can send to the original Order recipient, or any email address that you specify.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin adds a new &#8216;Send Emails&#8217; meta box to your WooCommerce order-edit page that you can use to either &#8220;Send&#8221; or &#8220;Preview&#8221; any email. These are both very useful for Shop Admins, to see what the Customer will see, or Designers\/Developers, to see what the email looks like.

We decided to remove the feature as the plugin had evolved from an &#8220;Email Previewing&#8221; plugin into a more advanced &#8220;Email Customizing&#8221; plugin and the ability to send emails from the order page was no longer something that was required or that we could feasibly maintain at a premium level for our customers. We discovered that there was still some demand for this feature so we&#8217;ve decided to release it as a free standalone plugin for the community.<\/p>\n<p>Happy Conversions!<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce 3.0 compatibility.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix issue where the email preview would not show the email you are currently looking at, rather it would show your latest order.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Change the Send Email interface from a simple prompt to a popup modal which is less rigid and more versatile.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Installation Instructions<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Once the plugin is activated you will see the new &#8216;Send Emails&#8217; meta-box on the WooCommerce &gt; Order page.<\/li>\n<li>Use the drop-down list to chose form all the transactional emails from your shop.<\/li>\n<li>Choose to &#8220;Send&#8221; or &#8220;Preview&#8221; the chosen transactional email.<\/li>\n<li>Please also be aware that there will be times where a 3rd party plugin emails cannot be previewed or sent as the plugin developer does not allow for this kind of after-order sending.
