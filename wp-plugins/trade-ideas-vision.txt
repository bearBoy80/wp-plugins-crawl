Smart Layouts were designed to allow the user to<br \/>\ngroup resizeable windows within a single container that can be easily shared or embedded within<br \/>\nother online media, while retaining the content determined by the user and presenting live data.<br \/>\nThis feature is based on the existing Trade Ideas concept of the user\u2019s ability to create their<br \/>\nown channel layouts and share them using the cloud features. But now they can be displayed outside<br \/>\nof the Trade Ideas client or web application. Trade Ideas Vision allows the user to embed  a layout<br \/>\nvia an iframe within the user&#8217;s content.  The shortcode to embed your layout window within your content is the following:<\/p>\n<pre><code>[tivision code=\"cloudcode\" height=\"height\" width=\"width\"]\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>In order to use this plugin, you will also need to have an active Trade Ideas account<br \/>\nin order  to create the Smart Layouts to be displayed as well to generate the cloudcode to paste into the shortcode above.<\/p>\n<p>Please refer to Installation for further details.<\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>From your WordPress dashboard<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit &#8216;Plugins &gt; Add New&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Search for &#8216;TradeIdeas Vision&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Activate TradeIdeas Vision from your Plugins page.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>From WordPress.org<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the TradeIdeas Vision zipfile.<\/li>\n<li>Unzip and place the &#8216;tradeideas-vision&#8217; directory to your &#8216;\/wp-content\/plugins\/&#8217; directory.<\/li>\n<li>Activate TradeIdeas Vision from your Plugins page.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Please refer to the Screenshots for some of the steps below.<\/p>\n<h4>Create Your SmartLayout to Display in Your Blog or Web Page<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Please login to Trade Ideas at the following url: http:\/\/hadoop.trade-ideas.com\/TIProWeb\/TIPro.html?dev_tools=1<\/li>\n<li>After successful login,  select Tools &gt; Windows from the toolbar after which you will see the &#8216;Current Windows&#8217; popup display.
