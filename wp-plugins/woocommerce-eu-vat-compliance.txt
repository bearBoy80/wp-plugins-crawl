IVA) charged in the country of <em>purchase<\/em>, at the VAT rate of that country (background information: <a href=\"http:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/global\/en\/pages\/tax\/articles\/eu-2015-place-of-supply-changes-mini-one-stop-shop.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/global\/en\/pages\/tax\/articles\/eu-2015-place-of-supply-changes-mini-one-stop-shop.html<\/a>). This can apply even if the seller is not based in the EU or UK. It is accompanied by various auditing\/recording requirements.<\/p>\n<h4>How this plugin can take away the pain<\/h4>\n<p>This WooCommerce plugin provides features to assist with EU, UK and\/or Norwegian VAT law compliance. Currently, those features include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Identify your customers&#8217; locations:<\/strong> this plugin will record evidence of your customer&#8217;s location, using their billing or shipping address, and their IP address (via a GeoIP lookup).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Evidence is recorded, ready for audit:<\/strong> full information that was used to calculate VAT and customer location is displayed in the WooCommerce order screen in the back-end.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Display prices including correct VAT from the first page:<\/strong> GeoIP information is also used to show the correct VAT from the first time a customer sees a product. A widget and shortcode are also provided allowing the customer to set their own country.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Currency conversions:<\/strong> Most users (if not everyone) will be required to report VAT information in a specific currency. This may be a different currency from their shop currency. This feature causes conversion rate information to be stored together with the order, at order time. Currently, you can choose from official rates from the European Central Bank (ECB), Danish and Czech National Banks, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and HM Customs &amp; Revenue (UK). You can also over-ride the currency and rate-provider on a per-country basis.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Entering and maintaining each country&#8217;s VAT rates:<\/strong> this plugin assists with entering EU and\/or UK VAT rates accurately by supplying a single button to press in your WooCommerce tax rates settings, to add or update rates for all countries (standard or reduced) with one click.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reporting:<\/strong> Advanced reporting capabilities, allowing you to see all the information needed to make a OSS\/MOSS\/IOSS (one-stop shop) VAT report. The report is sortable and broken down by country, VAT rate, VAT type (traditional\/variable) and order status, and can be exported as a CSV.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Forbid vatable sales if any goods have VAT chargeable<\/strong> &#8211; for shop owners for whom VAT compliance is too burdensome, this feature will allow you to forbid customers from configured VAT territories to check-out if they have selected any goods which are subject to VAT (whilst still allowing purchase of other goods, unlike the built-in WooCommerce feature which allows you to forbid check-out from some countries entirely).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Central control:<\/strong> brings all settings, reports and other information into a single centralised location, so that you don&#8217;t have to deal with items spread all over the WordPress dashboard.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mixed shops:<\/strong> You can sell goods subject to your chosen territories&#8217; VAT under the customer-place-of-supply regulations and any other physical goods which are subject to traditional base-country-based VAT regulations. The plugin supports this via allowing you to identify which tax classes in your WooCommerce configuration are used for customer-place-of-supply items. Products are allocated to the correct country according to which country VAT is payable to.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Distinguish VAT from other taxes:<\/strong> if you are in a jurisdiction where you have to apply other taxes also, then this plugin can correctly distinguish which taxes are payable to which jurisdictions.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Add line to invoices:<\/strong> If VAT was paid on the order, then an extra, configurable line can be added to the footer of the PDF invoice (when using the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips\/\" rel=\"ugc\">the free WooCommerce PDF invoices and packing slips plugin<\/a>, or its premium counterpart).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Refund support:<\/strong> includes information on refunded VAT, on relevant orders.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Same prices:<\/strong> Not strictly a VAT compliance issue (different pricing per-country is not illegal), but this plugin adds an option to enable WooCommerce&#8217;s hidden support for adjusting pre-tax prices to enable the same post-tax (net) price to apply in all customer locations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Brexit-ready:<\/strong> The plugin has been audited and appropriately adapted to be usable by both &#8220;EU 27&#8221; and UK (and other) countries after the expiry of the EU and UK&#8217;s transitional period (at the end of December 2020), including the ability to report taxes in multiple currencies using different exchange rate providers. Existing users should take the time to go through their existing settings to adapt to their new situation (e.g. remove tax table entries for countries that they are no longer required to remit taxes to; check that they are using the correct exchange rate provider and reporting currency for each tax region that they remit to).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>WooCommerce high-performance order storage:<\/strong> This plugin is HPOS-compatible (see: https:\/\/woocommerce.com\/document\/high-performance-order-storage\/)<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.simbahosting.co.uk\/s3\/product\/woocommerce-eu-vat-compliance\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">A Premium version is on sale at this link<\/a>, and currently has these <em>additional<\/em> features ready:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>VAT-registered buyers can be exempted, and their numbers validated:<\/strong> a VAT number can be entered at the check-out, and it will be validated (via VIES, HMRC or VatSense). Qualifying customers can then be exempted from VAT on their purchase, and their information recorded. The customer&#8217;s VAT number will be appended to the billing address where shown (e.g. order summary email, PDF invoices). An extra, configurable line specific to this situation can be added to the footer of the PDF invoice (when using the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips\/\" rel=\"ugc\">the free WooCommerce PDF invoices and packing slips plugin<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Partial VAT exemption:<\/strong><strong> make VAT-exemption upon supply of a valid VAT number to only apply to products in tax classes specified by the shop owner (rather than to all products)<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optionally allow B2B sales only<\/strong> &#8211; for shop owners who wish to only make sales that are VAT-exempt (i.e. B2B sales only), you can require that any EU and\/or UK customers (optionally including or excluding those in your country) enter a valid VAT number at the check-out. (You can have different policies for different VAT regions).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change taxation rules based upon year-to-date sales thresholds:<\/strong> for shop owners who can or must tax differently based upon their total sales in the year so far (e.g. EU shop owners who can take advantage of a \u20ac10,000 threshold for cross-border sales before which they can treat the place of supply as being their own, not the customer&#8217;s location), you can dynamically treat products as having a different taxation class until this threshold is met.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CSV download:<\/strong> A CSV containing comprehensive information on all orders with VAT data from your configured regions can be downloaded (including full compliance information). Manipulate in your spreadsheet program to make arbitrary calculations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Non-contradictory evidences:<\/strong> require two non-contradictory evidences of location (if the customer address and GeoIP lookup contradict, then the customer will be asked to self-certify his location, by choosing between them).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Show multiple currencies for VAT taxes on PDF invoices produced by <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips\/\" rel=\"ugc\">the free WooCommerce PDF invoices and packing slips plugin<\/a><\/strong> (and on credit notes produced by its Premium counterpart).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support for the official WooCommerce subscriptions extension, and for Subscriptio (a RightPress\/CodeCanyon alternative), and Subscriben.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Value-based exemption:<\/strong> An order can have VAT removed if the order value passes a configured value and is for a specified country. This features was developed to support the UK&#8217;s 2021 regulations for handling VAT differently on an order depending on whether or not the order passes a \u00a3135 threshold value, and then expanded to support multiple rules for different countries and amounts.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.simbahosting.co.uk\/s3\/product\/woocommerce-eu-vat-compliance\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more about the Premium version of this plugin at this link.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>It is believed (but not legally guaranteed), that armed with the above capabilities, a WooCommerce shop owner will be in a position to fulfil the requirements of EU or UK VAT laws: identifying the customer&#8217;s location and collecting multiple pieces of evidence, applying the correct VAT rate, validating VAT numbers for B2B transactions, and having the data needed to create returns. (If in the EU or UK, then you will also need to make sure that you are issuing your customers with VAT invoices containing the information required in your jurisdiction, via <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips\/\" rel=\"ugc\">a suitable WooCommerce invoice plugin<\/a>).<\/p>\n<h4>Footnotes and legalese<\/h4>\n<p>This plugin is supported on, and information in this document is for, WooCommerce 3.8 up to the latest release (i.e. current version; you can still <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/woocommerce-eu-vat-compliance\/advanced\/\" rel=\"ugc\">download older versions supporting previous WooCommerce release series if you wish<\/a>). It fetches data on current VAT rates from Amazon S3 (using SSL if possible); or, upon failure to connect to Amazon S3, from https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com. If your server&#8217;s firewall does not permit this, then it will use static data contained in the plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Geographical IP lookups are performed via WooCommerce&#8217;s built-in geo-location features; or, alternatively, if you use CloudFlare, then you can <a href=\"https:\/\/support.cloudflare.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/200168236-What-does-CloudFlare-IP-Geolocation-do-\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">activate the CloudFlare feature for sending geographical information<\/a>.

Furthermore, nothing in this plugin (including its documentation) constitutes legal or financial or any other kind of advice of any sort. In particular, you remain completely and solely liable for your own compliance with all taxation laws and regulations at all times, including research into what you must comply with. Installing any version of this plugin does not absolve you of any legal liabilities, or transfer any liabilities of any kind to us, and we provide no guarantee that use of this plugin will cover everything that your store needs to be able to do.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you think the EU&#8217;s treaties with other jurisdictions will lead to success in enforcing the collection of taxes in other jurisdictions is a question for lawyers and potential tax-payers, not for software developers!<\/p>\n<p>Many thanks to Diego Zanella, for various ideas we have swapped whilst working on these issues.

The &#8220;Items&#8221; column (which does not take partial refunds into account) is still available, but now hidden by default.<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: In the tax rates readiness test, if less tax rates were found in your tables than expected, then the resulting message had confusing wording.<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: In the tax rates readiness test, accomodate the fact that sales between the Isle of Man and the UK are not accounted as exports, but as in-country transactions.<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Allow the rounding and formatting functions to be filtered, for easier customisation, in case anyone has varying local requirements<\/li>\n<li>FIX: If you had unused and deleted tax classes in your WooCommerce install, then the readiness test for whether you had VAT rates for each country would still see these, as WooCommerce does not actually delete them from the database when you remove them from your WooCommerce options.<\/li>\n<li>FIX: In the tax rates readiness test, some wrong rates in the &#8216;Standard&#8217; class could be overlooked<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.36 &#8211; 2016-12-31<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Update the bundled VAT rates file to reflect the change in Romania VAT rate<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.35 &#8211; 2016-12-27<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: For certain classes of VAT number lookup failure (Premium version), associated returned information about the failure was not always making it through<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Update the bundled updater to version 1.3.0, which allows the user to choose to automatically install updates (applies to Premium version only)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.34 &#8211; 2016-12-16<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Added an &#8216;export settings&#8217; button, which makes debugging\/comparisons easier<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Remove a non-sensical line from the free\/paid feature comparison table, which had crept in from the code in another of my plugins that it was originally copy\/pasted from.<\/li>\n<li>FIX: A logic error meant that certain combinations of options surrounding forbidding all non-B2B orders without valid EU VAT numbers did not work correctly<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.32 &#8211; 2016-12-10<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: On orders which had multiple refunds against them, the VAT could be totalled wrongly if the MySQL server returned records in an unexpected order.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.31 &#8211; 2016-11-29<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Add BTW, B.T.W. (Dutch) to the list of default strings recognised as VAT-like taxes<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: The &#8220;no VAT charged&#8221; invoice footer notice was not being added if the VAT number was accepted (i.e. VAT removed) for some other reason than a successful VIES validation; it is now added.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.30 &#8211; 2016-10-21<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Update the bundled updater to version 1.2.1, which is more tolerant of the plugin being moved to a different location (applies to Premium version only)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.29 &#8211; 2016-10-05<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Prevent a PHP notice when running custom reports<\/li>\n<li>PERFORMANCE: A considerable speed boost (typically 80% faster) when generating reports, via using larger page sizes on queries<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.28 &#8211; 2016-09-06<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Fix the operation of the VAT number box (and VAT deduction) on checkout pages for which the shop owner had restricted the allowed countries to only one.<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Updated the bundled updater class versions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.26 &#8211; 2016-07-29<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: The bundled VAT rates file reflects Greece&#8217;s new 24% rate<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.25 &#8211; 2016-07-07<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>COMPATIBILITY: Marked as compatible with the forthcoming WP 4.6<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Detailed CSV download (available in the Premium version) now includes a &#8220;payment method&#8221; column<\/li>\n<li>SECURITY: (Affects Premium version only): previous releases allowed any logged-in user to download CSV reports, by visiting a specially crafted URL. This is now restricted to those with permission to view WooCommerce reports only.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.24 &#8211; 2016-06-29<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: VIES has made a minor change to the format of the data it returns in the case of an invalid VAT number &#8211; previous versions of this plugin handled its new format as an &#8216;unknown&#8217; result. (So, if your settings were that unknown results should be treated as invalid, all was well &#8211; but if they were treated as valid, this was a problem).<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Pass back more data in the case of an unknown VIES result from the network<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.23 &#8211; 2016-04-26<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Add a work-around to parse some of the entities that the VIES server can pass back that the XML\/SOAP parser doesn&#8217;t like<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.22 &#8211; 2016-04-06<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Tweak rates readiness test to be more suitable for mixed stores (thanks to Fabian Schweinfurth for the patch)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.21 &#8211; 2016-04-04<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: CloudFlare&#8217;s IP country header has apparently begun returning some results in lower-case, contrary to the relevant ISO standard. Tweak code to deal with this by converting back to upper-case.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.20 &#8211; 2016-03-31<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Improve the wording of the option that allows store to require EU buyers to enter an EU VAT number.<\/li>\n<li>FIX: The capability for a customer to edit their saved VAT number was previously only working with specific WordPress permalink structures<\/li>\n<li>COMPATIBILITY: Marked as compatible with WordPress 4.5<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.19 &#8211; 2016-01-11<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Allow the base country to be exempted from the &#8220;require all customers to enter a VAT number&#8221; option (Premium)<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Provide an option allowing orders to be forbidden in case of conflicts between different evidences concerning the customer&#8217;s location (Premium)<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: The customer can now edit their saved VAT number as part of editing their billing address from their account page, for future orders (Premium)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.18 &#8211; 2016-01-09<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Fix issue with unnecessary warning in the reports caused by a bug in Subscriptio (only relevant if that plugin is active)<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Clarify the message indicating missing WooCommerce data when creating reports, to cover more possible causes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.17 &#8211; 2016-01-08<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Add a new (filterable) option allowing the base country to be excluded when requiring all customers with carts liable to digital VAT to have a valid EU VAT number (so, you can exclude chargeable B2C customers outside of your own country, but allow them within it).<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Removed obsolete fallback to VAT-number checking service that no longer exists<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.16 &#8211; 2016-01-01<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>COMPATIBILITY: Tested + supported on WooCommerce 2.5 (tested with beta 3)<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Update bundled VAT rates file to reflect updated VAT rate for Romania (20%). Do remember to visit your tax rates pages in WooCommerce, and update them to current rates. (And if you&#8217;ve not yet set up a readiness report that automatically emails you about potential problems in WooCommerce -&gt; EU VAT Compliance -&gt; Readiness Report, if you&#8217;ve not done so already). (Note that the bundled file isn&#8217;t the first chosen source of VAT rates &#8211; so, even if you don&#8217;t update to the latest plugin version, you can get the latest rates; but you do need to update your tables).<\/li>\n<li>FIX: Fix a variable misnaming causing a JavaScript error on WC &lt; 2.5 in the only-briefly-available 1.10.16<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.14 &#8211; 2015-12-01<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: When VIES is unreachable, pass more information back to the customer\/shop owner (e.g. the member state&#8217;s service was unavailable)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.13 &#8211; 2015-11-25<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Make the button for adding EU VAT rates to tax settings work in WC 2.5<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add an option for what to do if VIES is unreachable. Defaults to the previous option: which was to assume that the customer entered a valid VAT number (which is more common than not &#8211; but you may wish to be strict, and prefer to lose the sales until VIES is back online).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.12 &#8211; 2015-10-31<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Add a field in the WooCommerce tax rates table allowing adjustment of the tax description (so, for example, you can use MWSt or IVA instead of the default &#8216;VAT&#8217;, and avoid having to edit each line manually)<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Update the alternate reduced VAT rate for Greece in the bundled JSON rates (though, alternate rates aren&#8217;t currently used in the plugin)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.11 &#8211; 2015-10-14<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: When WooCommerce Subscriptions 2.0+ is in use, use the new provided method instead of relying upon a deprecated method<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.10 &#8211; 2015-10-12<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Remove debugging function inadvertantly left in 1.10.8<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Work around bug in WooCommerce Subscriptions 2.0.0 (which is fixed in WooCommerce Subscriptions 2.0.1, so you should update that)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.8 &#8211; 2015-10-10<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Fix bug that caused some 100% refunded orders to have the refunded amount appear in the dashboard summary table in the row for orders with &#8216;completed&#8217; status<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Small internal reorganisation of how the report is generated, allowing easier access from other scripts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.7 &#8211; 2015-09-11<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Add a CSS class to the form element containing a drop-down country selection widget<\/li>\n<li>FIX: The setting for the store&#8217;s VAT number (Premium), used for optional extended VAT checks, was rejecting some valid formats.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.6 &#8211; 2015-08-21<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Show the customer&#8217;s VAT number (if any) in the billing address on the &#8220;My Account&#8221; page<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Prevent PHP notice being logged when displaying order in admin when no currency conversion was needed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.5 &#8211; 2015-08-13<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Attempt to re-parse returned VIES result with a different encoding if default parse fails on an encoding issue<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.4 &#8211; 2015-08-01<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Store&#8217;s VAT number check (Premium) in readiness report will display an error message, if possible, if validation fails<\/li>\n<li>COMPATIBILITY: Tested with WooCommerce 2.4 (RC1) and WP 4.3 (RC1). No issues identified (i.e. existing release believed to be compatible).<\/li>\n<li>TRANSLATION: Updated French translation (thanks to Guy Pasteger)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.3 &#8211; 2015-07-16<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Remove stray line of code in 1.10.2 which broke the EU VAT control centre page layout<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.2 &#8211; 2015-07-16<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Country selector shortcode now returns its output, instead of echo-ing it (which could cause it to appear in the wrong place)<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: (Premium) All (or your selection of) &#8220;readiness tests&#8221; can now be run automatically daily, with results of any failing tests emailed to specified email addresses.<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: The comprehensive CSV download (Premium) now includes an &#8216;Invoice Number&#8217; column, if that feature is in use, currently supporting the WooCommerce PDF &amp; Packing Slips plugin<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Remove a couple of error_log() debugging calls left in 1.10.1<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: In in-dashboard reports, show all amounts to the number of decimal places configured in the main WooCommerce settings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10.1 &#8211; 2015-07-13<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: VAT summary report table now has an option to export the table directly as a CSV file<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: It is now possible to perform an extended VIES lookup, recording the customer&#8217;s detailed information (if available) of any customers supplying VAT numbers (thanks to Sven Auhagen for code and ideas)<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Cause the VAT number field to be pre-populated if a logged-in repeat customer checks out<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Show the customer&#8217;s VAT number (if any) in their profile page (in the WooCommerce customer information section)<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Add support for WPML for multi-language translation of fields shown at the checkout and price suffixes<\/li>\n<li>FIX: Fix issue which could cause VAT number field to wrongly not appear in certain complicated visiting country\/customer country\/goods\/taxes combinations (required that GeoIP lookup was inaccurate, amongst other conditions)<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Removed a little unused code<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: When advising of pre-WC-2.1 orders (which have incomplete information due to WC not recording it before 2.2), indicate which orders specifically are meant.<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: It turns out that a WooCommerce order can remain in the &#8216;Payment Pending&#8217; state forever, causing a surprising &#8220;pre-WC-2.1 order&#8221; notice in one of the charts, if a customer comes back to complete a pending order from long ago. The wording of the notice has been changed to reflect this.

This fix will also be OK next month in case this was a mistake and they revert, or even if they switch back to Dec 2014&#8217;s location. Update in order to make sure you are using current rates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.7.2 &#8211; 2015-02-07<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>COMPATIBILITY: Tested on WooCommerce 2.3 (RC1). Note that WooCommerce EU VAT Compliance will over-ride WooCommerce 2.3&#8217;s built-in geo-location features &#8211; so, you should not need to adjust any settings after updating to WooCommerce 2.3. WooCommerce 2.0 is no longer officially supported or tested (though this release is still believed to be compatible).<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add order number to the CSV download (allowing order number to differ from the WooCommerce order ID &#8211; e.g. if using http:\/\/www.woothemes.com\/products\/sequential-order-numbers-pro\/).<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Introduce WC_EU_VAT_NOCOUNTRYPRESELECT constant, allowing you to disable the built-in country pre-selection (if, for example, you already have an existing solution)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.7.1 &#8211; 2015-01-20<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: No longer require the shop base country to be in the EU when applying VAT exemptions for B2B customers<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Add an option for a separate checkbox for the &#8220;show prices without taxes&#8221; option in the country-selection widget (in addition to the existing, but not-necessarily-easy-to-find, menu option on the country list)<\/li>\n<li>TRANSLATION: Updated French translation (thanks to Guy Pasteger)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.7.0 &#8211; 2015-01-13<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>USER NOTE: This plugin is already compatible with version 2.0 of the GeoIP detect plugin, but if\/when you update to that, you will need to update the GeoIP database (as version 2.0 uses a new format) &#8211; go to Tools -&gt; GeoIP Detection &#8230; you will then need to reload the dashboard once more to get rid of the &#8220;No database&#8221; warning message.<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Optionally forbid checkout if any goods liable to EU VAT are in the cart (this can be a better option than using WooCommerce&#8217;s built-in feature to forbid all sales at all to EU countries &#8211; perhaps not all your goods are VAT-liable. Note that this is a stronger option that the existing option to only forbid consumer sales (i.e. customers who have no access to VAT exemption via supply of a VAT number))<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Support mixed shops, selling goods subject to EU VAT under the 2015 digital goods regulations and other goods subject to traditional base-country-based VAT regulations. The plugin supports this via allowing you to identify which tax classes in your WooCommerce configuration are used for 2015 digital goods items. Products which you place in other tax classes are not included in calculations\/reports made by this plugin for per-country tax liabilities, even if VAT was charged upon them. (For such goods, you calculate how much you owe your local tax-man by using WooCommerce&#8217;s built-in tax reports).<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Within {iftax}{\/iftax} tags, you can use the special value value {country_with_brackets} to show the country that tax was calculated using, surrounded by brackets, if one is relevant; or nothing will be shown if not. Example: {iftax}incl. VAT {country_with_brackets}{\/iftax}. This is most useful for mixed shops, where you will not what the confuse the customer by showing the country for products for which the VAT is not based upon country.<\/li>\n<li>FIX: Country pre-selection drop-down via shortcode was not activating if the page URL had a # in it.<\/li>\n<li>FIX: Unbalanced div tag in Premium plugin on checkout page if self-certification was disabled.<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Negative VAT number lookups are now cached for 1 minute instead of 7 days (to mitigate the possible undesirable consequences of cacheing a false negative, and given that we expect very few negatives anyway)<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Change prefix used for transient names, to effectively prevent any previously cached negative lookups for certain valid Spanish VAT numbers (see 1.6.14) being retained, without requiring the shop owner to manually flush their transients.<\/li>\n<li>TRANSLATION: Updated French translation (thanks to Guy Pasteger)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.6.14 &#8211; 2015-01-10<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Upon discovery of a valid Spanish VAT number which the existing API server did not return as valid, we now use the official VIES service directly, and fall back to a second option if that does not respond positively (thus adding some redundancy if one service is down).<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: VAT number validity at the checkout is now checked as it is typed (i.e. before order is placed), and feedback given allowing the customer to respond (e.g. hint that you have chosen a different country to that which the VAT number is for).<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Support for the official exchange rates of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (http:\/\/www.cbr.ru)<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Move the position of the &#8220;VAT Number&#8221; field at the checkout to the bottom of the billing column, and make it filterable<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: If Belgian customer enters a 9-digit VAT number, then automatically prefix with a 0 (https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/vat-eu-country-codes-vat-numbers-and-vat-in-other-languages)<\/li>\n<li>TRANSLATIONS: Updated POT file<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.6.13 &#8211; 2015-01-08<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: The button to add tax rates was not appearing when WordPress was en Fran\u00e7ais.<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add TVA\/T.V.A. to the list of taxes recognised as VAT by default<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Readiness test in the free version will now alert if the WooCommerce Subscriptions extension is active (free version does not contain the extra code needed to support it)<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add link in the control centre to the official EU PDF detailing current VAT rates<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.6.12 &#8211; 2015-01-06<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: CSV downloads now take notice of the chosen dates in the date selector widget (reports) (i.e. so you can now also download selected data, instead of only downloading all data)<\/li>\n<li>FIX: Some more translated strings are now translated in the admin interface.<\/li>\n<li>FIX: Restore functionality on WooCommerce &lt; 2.2 (checkout broken in 1.6.0)<\/li>\n<li>FIX: Don&#8217;t tweak the &#8220;taxes estimated for&#8221; message on the cart page on WooCommerce &lt; 2.2.9, since the country choice widget requires this version<\/li>\n<li>FIX: The button on the report date selector form, if accessed via the compliance centre (rather than WooCommerce reports) was not working<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.6.11 &#8211; 2015-01-06<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Restore ability to run on PHP 5.2<\/li>\n<li>FIX: If no current exchange rates were available at check-out time, and HTTP network download failed, then this case was handled incorrectly.<\/li>\n<li>FIX: Some settings strings were not being translated in the admin interface.<\/li>\n<li>FIX: &#8220;Taxes estimated for&#8221; message on the cart page now indicates the correct country<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Move widget + shortcode code to a different file<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: CSV order download will now only list orders from 1st Jan 2015 onwards, to prevent large numbers of database queries for orders preceeding the VAT law on shops with large existing order lists.<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: CSV order download will now intentionally show orders from non-EU countries (since these could be subject to audit for compliance also); a later release will make this optional.

This feature also pre-sets the billing country on the check-out page.<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Option to make entry of VAT number for VAT exemption either optional, mandatory, or not possible. (Previously, only &#8216;optional&#8217; was available). This means that store owners can decide to always charge VAT, or to not take orders from EU customers who are not VAT exempt. (Non-EU customers can still make orders; if you do not wish that to be possible, then there are existing WooCommerce settings for that). (This option is only relevant to the premium version, as the free version has no facility for entering VAT numbers).<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Support for WooCommerce subscriptions (Premium)<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Self-certification option now asks for &#8216;country of residence&#8217;, rather than of current location; to comply with our updated understanding of what the user should be asked to do. (But note that the message was, and continues to be, over-ridable via the wc_eu_vat_certify_message filter).<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Make it possible (via a filter, wc_eu_vat_certify_form_field) to not pre-select any option for the self-certified VAT country.

Credit to Diego Zanella for the idea and modified code.<\/li>\n<li>FEATURE: Rate information is now saved at order time in more detail, and displayed by rate; this is important data, especially if you sell goods which are not all in the same VAT band (i.e. different VAT bands in the same country, e.g. standard rate and reduced rate)<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Move compliance information on the order screen into its own meta box<\/li>\n<li>TWEAK: Exchange rate information is now stored with the order in a more convenient format &#8211; we recommend you update (though, the old format is still supported; but, it&#8217;s not 1st Jan yet, so actually we recommend you apply every update until then, as nobody has a good reason to be running legacy code before the law launches).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.5.4 &#8211; 2014-12-26<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Back-end order page now shows the VAT paid as 0.00 instead of &#8216;Unknown&#8217;, if a valid VAT number was entered.
