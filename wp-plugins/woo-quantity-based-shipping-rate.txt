I then  tried it on a non mu environment and it worked. What it does not do is create a shipping method that you can then add to a shipping class and hence have different rates for different zones so it pretty much has to be quantity based shipping that is globally applicable. Plug in has potential and would encourage the developer to keep working on it and making it more robust. It would be worth at some point to thinking about creating a premium version. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-quantity-based-shipping-rate.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-quantity-based-shipping-rate\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1539280","caption":""},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-quantity-based-shipping-rate\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1539280","caption":""}},"tags":{"delivery":"delivery","quantity":"quantity","quantity-based-shipping":"quantity based shipping","shipping-rates":"shipping rates","woocommerce-shipping-plugin":"woocommerce shipping plugin"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
