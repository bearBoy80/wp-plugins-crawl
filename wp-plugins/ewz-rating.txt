It generates forms for displaying and judging images that were uploaded via EntryWizard ( either using its regular individual upload or using its batch entry upload facility ).<\/p>\n<p>The data displayed in the forms, the judges allowed to see it, and the selection of images shown may all be configured by the administrators.<\/p>\n<p>Judges may sort the forms by most columns, including any scores they have entered.<\/p>\n<p>Selected information about each image and\/or maker may optionally be displayed in read-only fashion.<\/p>\n<p>The judges must be logged-in users of the site who have been assigned a special role. Or the administrator may make the images and data visible to all logged-in users, or only to the image owners.<\/p>\n<h4>Privacy<\/h4>\n<p>This plugin does not send any data to external servers. It does store in the wordpress database whatever data is requested in the forms designed by the administrator. Viewing of such data using the plugin&#8217;s shortcodes is always restricted to logged-in users, and is usually further restricted by the administrator.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Either<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to Plugins -&gt; Install New and search for EWZ-Rating.

Thus to create a rating-scheme you first have to select a layout.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>A rating-form is analagous to an EntryWizard webform.  It specifies a form to be displayed by the ewz_show_rating shortcode.  For each form, you may specify which images are displayed, and which judges have access.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the judging is complete, the administrators may download a spreadsheet containing the entered scores\/comments in one of two possible forms &#8211; either one line per rating, or one line per image.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If needed, further forms for tiebreaking, etc, may be generated that contain only specified images, and are visible only to specified judges.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Quickstart for the impatient ( for further details, click on the information buttons ):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Assign the &#8220;EntryWizard Judge&#8221; role to your judges ( it may be helpful to have a plugin installed that allows users to have multiple roles ).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In the EntryWizard &#8220;Rating Schemes&#8221; page, select the layout you wish to use and click &#8220;Add a New Scheme&#8221;.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Give the scheme a name. Drag the fields you wish to display to the judges into the right-hand column.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Add any fields you wish the judges to fill out ( works like EntryWizard fields ).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Set the image size, background color and text color, and save the scheme.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In the EntryWizard &#8220;Rating Forms&#8221; page, select your scheme and click &#8220;Add a New Rating Form&#8221;.<br \/>\nAll webforms with your selected layout should display in the &#8220;Item Selection&#8221; list.<br \/>\nAll your members with &#8220;EntryWizard Judge&#8221; role should display in the &#8220;Access Control&#8221; list.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fill out the name, identifier,  webform(s) and judges, open the rating form and save.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a page containing the shortcode [ewz_show_rating identifier=&#8221;.. your identifier here ..&#8221;].<br \/>\nClicking on a thumbnail in the page should open a new window containing a larger version of the image.<br \/>\nSubsequent clicks on other thumbnails should cause the selected image to display in the same window.<br \/>\n( If you normally have new windows open in tabs, you may need to drag the tab out of the browser window ).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the judging is over, download the results in a spreadsheet.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If further information is required about specific images, or ties need to be broken, create a new page with<br \/>\n[ewz_show_rating &#8230;.] shortcodes tailored to your needs ( see the help item at the top of the Rating Forms page ).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1.23<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Some extra buttons on the admin pages, to improve handling of large number of schemes and webforms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.22<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug in saving a rating scheme that only occurs when using PHP 8.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.21<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed very slow behaviour if both &#8220;Show drop-down selections as buttons&#8221;

WordPress, Entry Wizard, and EWZ Rating has simplified and minimised the amount of effort involved for our digital photo submissions and online evaluations. I just want to thank you and anyone else involved for all your hard work.\n\nIf I may make a suggestion? \nEntry Wizard also gives us the ability to review our past entries which is fantastic. \nI was wondering if it was possible to add a function to view our past entries along with the judge's award?<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Fantastic Plugin<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/gcpt\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d40645f934173f82f9d33b04ce4030e9?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d40645f934173f82f9d33b04ce4030e9?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/gcpt\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Gcpt<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>We've been using Entry Wizard on our club website for quite a while and has worked flawlessly. This is a wonderful addition that will make the judging process a lot more streamlined and less work for the competition secretary. Had to make a few css adjustments so the text colors worked with the dark theme we use. Once this was achieved the plugin is working brilliantly. Would certainly recommend this plugin.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Impressive<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/only1watchdog\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7bcb85d9d73fecbfa068fc6b1a6217db?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7bcb85d9d73fecbfa068fc6b1a6217db?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/only1watchdog\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Only1watchdog<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>This is a very versatile plugin for judging images.
