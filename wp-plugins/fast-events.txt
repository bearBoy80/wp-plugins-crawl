The only costs are the transaction costs of an order. For iDEAL (Netherlands) it is EUR 0.29 (ex VAT) per transaction.<br \/>\nIt does not matter how many tickets are ordered in the transaction, it&#8217;s always EUR 0.29 (in NL) for an iDEAL payment.<\/p>\n<p>Simply define you own e-tickets in your favorite word processor (Word, LibreOffice, &#8230;), leave an empty block of 120 x 40 mm<br \/>\navailable anywhere on your design where <code>Fast Events<\/code> can print the qrcode and other info.
