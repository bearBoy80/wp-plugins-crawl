Born out of the need for a file sharing tool that was not blocked by high security firewalls, such as many existing file sharing services are, Assets Manager was developed. When you upload a file, or set of files, Assets Manager generates obscured links to the files so that you can control how those files are shared.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.jackreichert.com\/2015\/11\/15\/how-assets-manager-replaced-our-sharefile\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Here\u2019s how it works.<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Set an expiration period for when the file link will expire.<\/li>\n<li>Disable links after they&#8217;ve been shared (no more fretting when sending out emails).<\/li>\n<li>Force anyone trying to access a link to log into your site.<\/li>\n<li>Creates landing page for each asset post type collecting files uploaded together into one link.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more information check out the full blogpost about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jackreichert.com\/2014\/01\/12\/introducing-assets-manager-for-wordpress\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Assets Manager<\/a>.<br \/>\nQuestions?

This means that global searches of the site will not bring up any of the uploaded assets. This does not block search engines from finding them if they are linked to from someplace else. But it does make finding files harder if you do not have a direct link to the file.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I upload a bunch of files and share them all with one link?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can. Assets Manager generates a page that contains all of the links in the asset set. This page can then be shared. Note: if you have disabled or expired files they will not be listed on this page, if a file is &#8220;secure&#8221; and the visitor is not logged in the file link will not appear as well.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I reorder the list of files on the public facing assets set page?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, just drag and drop. No need to save. All reordering happens via AJAX automatically.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Does this work with nginx?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, in some installs you may need to add this to your conf file, I needed this to serve images correctly:<br \/>\n    location ~ ^\/asset\/(.*)$ {<br \/>\n        try_files $uri $uri\/ \/index.php?$query_string;<br \/>\n    }<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What about foo bar?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Answer to foo bar dilemma.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with hooks firing when they shouldn\u2019t.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved error handling for fopen in case file was deleted.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete refactor of entire codebase.<\/li>\n<li>Leverages a better object oriented architecture, fopen, and wp.media.<\/li>\n<li>You can now change the asset base permalink.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.6.2<\/h4>\n<p>Fixed js typo that was preventing reordering feature<\/p>\n<h4>0.6.1<\/h4>\n<p>Added period before file download extension<\/p>\n<h4>0.6<\/h4>\n<p>Implemented a better way to serve files<\/p>\n<h4>0.5<\/h4>\n<p>Fixed ssl issues<\/p>\n<h4>0.4<\/h4>\n<p>Fixed issue where filename was not filename chosen<\/p>\n<h4>0.3<\/h4>\n<p>Fixed issue where period was replacing wrong text<\/p>\n<h4>0.2.9<\/h4>\n<p>Removed style that hides .nav-links<\/p>\n<h4>0.2.8<\/h4>\n<p>Fixed additional HR added to posts (props @AEsco11)<\/p>\n<h4>0.2.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactored file serving to handled certain extensions that were buggy.
