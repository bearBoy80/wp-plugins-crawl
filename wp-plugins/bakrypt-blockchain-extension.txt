The system will automatically pick up metadata from your products and generate a valid JSON structure required by Bakrypt&#8217;s API, BAkrypt&#8217;s API will mint the data structure as Cardano native tokens according to your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin also has the ability to upload images and documents into IPFS using Bakrypt&#8217;s IPFS node. Product thumbnail images will automatically be picked as the cover image for NFTs, and these will be uploaded at the time of minting. Once the transaction has been submitted, Bakrypt will generate a transaction with an estimated cost and a deposit address. Once payment is confirmed on the deposit address, Bakrypt will go ahead and mint the tokens in the Cardano blockchain. Following the minting process, any remaining tokens (ADA) and assets will be sent back to the sender&#8217;s address. Refunds are offered for <em>non-confirmed<\/em> transactions. It&#8217;s important to note that Bakrypt&#8217;s convenience fees for transactions that have been confirmed are <em>non-refundable<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin implements WordPress native cron tasks; the plugin will automatically pull asset data (every 3 minutes until the transaction is confirmed or canceled), into your WordPress store and update your store products. The metadata includes the transaction&#8217;s submitted JSON metadata as seen in the blockchain, policyId, fingerprint, and status. This metadata is used in several places in WordPress, such as printing the fingerprint of a minted asset in the order&#8217;s email that the customer receives, which improves the traceability of the product and increases trust in the store.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more \ud83d\ude80 -&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/bakrypt.readme.io\/reference\/blockchain-tokenization-extension-for-woocommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugin&#8217;s Docs<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Demo<\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ve created a demo store with custom permissions so that you can try the plugin without having to install a new instance.

They are stored on a blockchain and can be bought, sold, and traded like any other asset.<\/p>\n<p>One potential use case for NFTs within a supply chain is to track the ownership and movement of goods as they pass through various stages of production, distribution, and sale. For example, an NFT could be created for each batch of raw materials that enter a manufacturing facility, and then updated with information about where those materials were used and what products they were used to create. This could help companies track the origin and history of their products, and make it easier to trace them back to their source in the event of a recall or other issue.<\/p>\n<p>NFTs could also be used to verify the authenticity of products, by linking them to a unique digital asset that represents the product&#8217;s provenance. This could be particularly useful for high-value items such as luxury goods or art, where counterfeiting is a concern.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the use of NFTs in a supply chain could help companies improve transparency, traceability, and authenticity, which could in turn enhance customer trust and loyalty.<\/p>\n<h3>Bakrypt API<\/h3>\n<p>Are you looking to create and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs)?

Some potential benefits of using Cardano for NFTs include:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Security: Cardano uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm and a multi-layered architecture that is designed to be secure and resistant to attacks. This can be particularly important for NFTs, which may represent valuable or unique assets that need to be protected.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Scalability: Cardano is built to be scalable, with the ability to handle a large number of transactions per second. This can be useful for NFTs, which may be in high demand and require a fast and efficient platform to support their creation and exchange.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Interoperability: Cardano is designed to be interoperable with other blockchain platforms, which could allow NFTs created on Cardano to be easily integrated with other applications and systems.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Decentralized: Cardano is a decentralized platform, which means that it is not controlled by any single entity and is instead maintained by a distributed network of participants. This can provide users with greater control over their assets and reduce the risk of censorship or interference.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Community support: Cardano has a large and active community of developers and users who are involved in the project and contribute to its development. This can provide users with access to a wealth of resources and support when it comes to using Cardano for NFTs.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Bakrypt Docs<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/bakrypt.readme.io\/reference\/getting-started-with-your-api\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Getting started with our API<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/bakrypt.io\/docs\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Swagger Environment<\/a><\/p>\n","installation":"<p><strong>Make sure WooCommerce is also installed and activated<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>In your WordPress dashboard, choose Plugins &gt; Add new.<\/li>\n<li>Search for our plugin with the search bar in the top right corner.<\/li>\n<li>After finding the plugin in the results, click Install Now.
