I am in no way employed or even involved with The Jerusalem Post.  Nor did they ask me to write this plugin.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why does the feed have duplicate entries?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>That is a good question. All my plugin does is get the feed and displays it, the front page RSS feed has duplicate content sometimes because some articles will appear on home page in multiple sections.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why do some of the posts dated in the future?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Again, good question.  jpost.com&#8217;s timestamps from the feed are often off, and it isn&#8217;t a simple timezone issue.  Israel is 6 or 7 hours ahead of me, and I have seen timestamps that are 24 hours ahead of the real time.  Maybe they schedule new posts in the future on the site and they don&#8217;t have a filter on the RSS feed and it calls in future posts.  :\/<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds UL tags for more correct CSS<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-jerusalem-post\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=720416\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-jerusalem-post\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=720416\" alt=\"Just a sample of what the feed looks like in the 2012 Theme\"><\/a><p>Just a sample of what the feed looks like in the 2012 Theme<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-jerusalem-post\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=720416\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-jerusalem-post\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=720416\" alt=\"This shows you the widget on the backend\"><\/a><p>This shows you the widget on the backend<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-jerusalem-post.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-jerusalem-post\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=720416","caption":"Just a sample of what the feed looks like in the 2012 Theme"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-jerusalem-post\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=720416","caption":"This shows you the widget on the backend"}},"tags":{"feed":"feed","israel":"israel","jerusalem":"jerusalem","jpost":"jpost","jpost-com":"jpost.com"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-jerusalem-post.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-jerusalem-post.1.0.1.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/thewpway.com","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-jerusalem-post\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=720416","high":false}}
