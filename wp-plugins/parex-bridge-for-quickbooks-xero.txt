The tool is now on auto-pilot and it saves us days of work every month! \n\nWe manage our stock in Xero and the tool does a great job keeping the shop and Accounting system in sync. Invoices are created for each purchase quickly and automatic, so are credit notes for refunds. We mapped all our various payment systems to the various accounts in Xero with some help from their support.\n\nSpeaking off, the support is super responsive and helpful. We provided suggestions in the early days of Parex Bridge and saw great solutions implemented really quick. Once they even build a one off script for us that helped us save a lot of time.\n\nCan't fault these guys. The tool is worth every cent.
