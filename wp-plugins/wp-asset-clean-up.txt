However, you don&#8217;t need to use all of them and to improve the speed of your website and make the HTML source code cleaner (convenient for debugging purposes), it&#8217;s better to prevent those styles and scripts from loading.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, you might use a plugin that generates contact forms and it loads its assets (.CSS and .JS files) in every page of your website instead of doing it only in the \/contact page (if that&#8217;s the only place where you need it).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Asset CleanUp&#8221; scans your page and detects all the assets that are loaded. All you have to do when editing a page\/post is just to select the CSS\/JS that are not necessary to load, this way reducing the bloat.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin works best in combination with a cache plugin (e.g. WP Rocket, WP Fastest Cache, W3 Total Cache), a hosting company that offers packages with server-level caching available (e.g. WP Engine, Kinsta) or a service like Cloudflare that has page caching enabled.<\/p>\n<h4>Main plugin&#8217;s benefits include<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Decreases the number of HTTP requests loaded and eliminate render-blocking resources (important for faster page load) by unloading useless CSS\/JS<\/li>\n<li>Preload CSS\/JS, Local Fonts &amp; Google Fonts files to instruct the browser to download the chosen assets as soon as possible<\/li>\n<li>Minify CSS files (including inline code within STYLE tags)<\/li>\n<li>Minify JavaScript files (including inline code within SCRIPT tags)<\/li>\n<li>Combine remaining loaded CSS &amp; JavaScript files<\/li>\n<li>Inline CSS Files (automatically &amp; by specifying the path to the stylesheets)<\/li>\n<li>Defer combined JavaScript files by applying &#8220;defer&#8221; attribute to the SCRIPT tags<\/li>\n<li>Site-wide removal for Emojis, Dashicons for guest users and Comment Reply if they are not used<\/li>\n<li>Disable RSS Feeds<\/li>\n<li>Reduces the HTML code of the actual page (that&#8217;s even better if GZIP compression is enabled)<\/li>\n<li>Makes source code easier to scan in case you&#8217;re a developer and want to search for something<\/li>\n<li>Remove possible conflicts between plugins\/theme (e.g. 2 JavaScript files that are loading from different plugins and they interfere one with another)<\/li>\n<li>Better performance score if you test your URL on websites such as GTmetrix, PageSpeed Insights, Pingdom Website Speed Test<\/li>\n<li>Google will love your website more as it would be faster and fast page load is nowadays a factor in search ranking<\/li>\n<li>Your server access log files (e.g the Apache ones) will be easier to scan and would take less space on your server<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Google Fonts Optimization \/ Removal<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Combine all Google Font requests into fewer (usually one) requests, saving one round trip to the server for each additional font requested<\/li>\n<li>Choose between three methods of delivery: Render-blocking, Asynchronous via Web Font Loader (webfont.js) or Asynchronous by preloading the CSS stylesheet<\/li>\n<li>Option to preload Google Font Files from fonts.gstatic.com (e.g. ending in .woff2)<\/li>\n<li>Apply &#8220;font-display&#8221; CSS property to all loaded Google Font requests<\/li>\n<li>Enable preconnect resource hint for fonts.gstatic.com in case you use Google Fonts; don&#8217;t let the browser wait until it fetches the CSS for loading the font files before it begins DNS\/TCP\/TLS<\/li>\n<li>Remove all Google Font requests including link\/font preloads, @import\/@font-face from CSS files &amp; STYLE tags, resource hints<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Local Fonts Optimization<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Preload local font files (ending in .woff, .woff2, .ttf, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Apply &#8220;font-display&#8221; CSS property value to LINK \/ STYLE tags (Pro version)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Remove useless links, meta tags and HTML comments within the HEAD and BODY (footer) tags of the website<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Really Simple Discovery (RSD) link tag<\/li>\n<li>Windows Live Writer link tag<\/li>\n<li>REST API link tag<\/li>\n<li>Pages\/Posts Shortlink tag<\/li>\n<li>Post&#8217;s Relational Links tag<\/li>\n<li>WordPress version meta tag (also good for security reasons)<\/li>\n<li>All &#8220;generator&#8221; meta tags (also good for security reasons)<\/li>\n<li>RSS Feed Link Tags (usually they are not needed if your website is not used for blogging purposes)<\/li>\n<li>oEmbeds, if you do not need to embed videos (e.g. YouTube), tweets and audios<\/li>\n<li>Valid HTML Comments (exceptions from stripping can be added and Internet Explorer conditional comments are preserved)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Each option can be turned on\/off depending on your needs.

Features such as minify\/combine CSS\/JS files or combine Google Fonts (if any loaded) aren&#8217;t guaranteed to work (basically, anything requiring writing files to the caching directory). However, if you want to unload CSS\/JS files, which is the key feature of the plugin, then this has always been tested &amp; working for WordPress.com websites.

Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, Opera etc.). Asset CleanUp deals with CSS and JavaScript assets which are enqueued in WordPress by your theme and other plugins.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20a%20caching%20one%3F'>\nIs this plugin a caching one?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, Asset CleanUp does not do any page caching. It just helps you unload .css and .js that you choose as not needed from specific pages (or all pages). This, combined with an existing caching plugin, will make your website pages load faster and get a higher score in speed checking tools such as GTMetrix (Google PageSpeed and YSlow).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='has%20this%20plugin%20been%20tested%20with%20other%20caching%20plugins%3F'>\nHas this plugin been tested with other caching plugins?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin was tested with W3 Total Cache, WP Rocket and WP Fastest Caching and should work with any caching plugin as any page should be cached only after the page (HTML Source) was rendered and all the enqueueing \/ dequeueing was already completed (from either the plugins or the theme). Asset CleanUp comes with minify\/combine files feature. Please do not also enable the same feature on a caching plugin. Example: If you already minified CSS\/JS files with Asset CleanUp, do not enable Minify CSS\/JS in WP Rocket or other caching plugins.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='i%27ve%20noticed%20scripts%20and%20styles%20that%20are%20loaded%20on%20the%20page%2C%20but%20they%20do%20not%20show%20in%20the%20%22asset%20cleanup%22%20list%20when%20editing%20the%20page%20or%20no%20assets%20are%20showing%20at%20all.%20why%20is%20that%3F'>\nI&#8217;ve noticed scripts and styles that are loaded on the page, but they do not show in the &#8220;Asset CleanUp&#8221; list when editing the page or no assets are showing at all. Why is that?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are a few known reasons why you might see different or no assets loading for management:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Those assets weren&#8217;t loaded properly into WordPress by the theme\/plugin author as they were likely hardcoded and not enqueued the WordPress way. Here&#8217;s a tutorial that will help you understand better the enqueuing process: http:\/\/www.wpbeginner.com\/wp-tutorials\/how-to-properly-add-javascripts-and-styles-in-wordpress\/<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>You&#8217;re using a cache plugin that is caching pages even when you&#8217;re logged in which is something I don&#8217;t recommend as you might have conflicts with other plugins as well (e.g. in W3 Total Cache, you can enable\/disable this) or that plugin is caching pages even when a POST request is made to them (which is not a good practice as there are many situations in which a page should not be cached). That could happen if you&#8217;re using &#8220;WP Remote POST&#8221; method (from version 1.2.4.4) of retrieving the assets in the Dashboard.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>You might have other functions or plugins (e.g. Plugin Organizer) that are loading prior to Asset CleanUp. Note that Plugin Organizer has a file that is in \u201cmu-plugins\u201d which will load prior to any plugin you have in \u201cplugins\u201d, thus, if you have disabled specific plugins through \u201cPlugin Organizer\u201d in some pages, their assets will obviously not show in the assets list as they are not loaded at all in the first place.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If none of these apply to you and you just don&#8217;t see assets that should definitely show there, please open a support ticket.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20are%20the%20unload%20settings%20that%20i%27ve%20applied%20for%20css%2Fjs%20files%20not%20taking%20any%20effect%20when%20i%20visit%20the%20page%3F'>\nWhy are the unload settings that I&#8217;ve applied for CSS\/JS files not taking any effect when I visit the page?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whenever you unload certain CSS\/JS files, you expect to either see an immediate increase in the Google PageSpeed Insights \/ GTMetrix score or not loaded when you test the page in Incognito (visiting it as a guest, while you\u2019re not logged-in).

It restores deprecated features and behaviors so that older code will still run properly on jQuery 1.9 and later.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are cases when you might not need jQuery at all on a page.

Possible reasons why nothing is shown despite the wait might be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your internet connection cut off after you loaded the edit post\/post (before the AJAX calls were triggered). Make sure to check that and refresh the page if it&#8217;s back on &#8211; it happened to me a few times<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>There could be a conflict between plugins or your theme and something is interfering with the script that is retrieving the assets<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>You are loading the WordPress Dashboard through HTTPS, but you are forcing the front-end to load via HTTP. Although Asset CleanUp auto-corrects the retrieval URL (e.g. if you&#8217;re logged in the Dashboard securely via HTTPS, it will attempt to fetch the assets through HTTPS too), there could be cases where another plugin or .htaccess forces an HTTP connection only for the public view. Due to Same Origin Policy (read more here: https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/En\/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript), you can&#8217;t make plain HTTP AJAX calls from HTTPS connections. If that&#8217;s the case, try to enable &#8220;WP Remote POST&#8221; as a retrieval method in the plugin&#8217;s settings if you want to manage the assets in the Dashboard.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>You&#8217;re using plugins such as Wordfence that block the AJAX request. At this time, if that&#8217;s the case, it&#8217;s best to enable managing assets in the front-end view (Settings).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In this case, it&#8217;s advisable to enable &#8220;Manage in the Front-end?&#8221; in &#8220;Settings&#8221; of &#8220;Asset CleanUp&#8221;, thus making the list to show at the bottom of the posts, pages, and front-page only for the logged in users with admin privileges.<\/p>\n<p>Although I&#8217;ve written the code to ensure maximum compatibility, there are factors which are not up to the quality of the plugin that could interfere with it.<br \/>\nIn case the assets are not loading for you, please write to me on the forum and I will be happy to assist you!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='i%20do%20not%20know%20or%20i%27m%20not%20sure%20which%20assets%20to%20unload%20on%20my%20pages.%20what%20should%20i%20do%3F'>\nI do not know or I&#8217;m not sure which assets to unload on my pages.

sometimes, users just wanted to minify inline code and leave the files untouched)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Clearing load exceptions from &#8220;Overview&#8221; didn&#8217;t work for all pages of a certain post type<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Make sure the plugin works well (e.g. without any PHP errors) if the plugins&#8217; directory is changed (e.g. from &#8220;plugins&#8221; to &#8220;plugins-custom-name&#8221;)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Better detection for the homepage (e.g. the latest posts page was mistaken with the homepage in the front-end view of the CSS\/JS manager)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Better detection for the singular page; Make sure the latest posts page such as the &#8220;Blog&#8221; one is also checked)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: On some WordPress installations, the plugin&#8217;s menu icon from the Dashboard&#8217;s sidebar was not showing properly (the height was too large)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: If there are too many assets\/plugins unloaded, when showing up in the top admin bar menu, the list was not scrollable (e.g. only 20 out of 40 assets were shown because the height of the browser&#8217;s window wasn&#8217;t large enough which can not be expanded on smaller devices)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: If the current theme supports HTML5, the &#8216;type=&#8221;text\/javascript&#8221;&#8216; attribute is not added any more to altered SCRIPT tags by Asset CleanUp, thus avoiding any errors from W3C validators<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.7.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The layout of a CSS\/JS area is changed on the make exception area &amp; a new option was added to make an exception from any unload rule on pages belonging to a specific post type (e.g. unload site-wide, but keep the asset loaded on all WooCommerce &#8216;product&#8217; pages)<\/li>\n<li>Oxygen plugin edit mode: Allow Asset CleanUp to trigger plugin &amp; CSS\/JS unload rules when the page editor is on to make the editor load faster via define(&#8216;WPACU_LOAD_ON_OXYGEN_BUILDER_EDIT&#8217;, true); that can be set in wp-config.php \/ read more: https:\/\/www.assetcleanup.com\/docs\/?p=1200<\/li>\n<li>In specific DIVI powered websites, the &#8220;PageSpeed&#8221; parameter is appended to the URL from the client-side, thus make sure to only check for &#8220;et_fb&#8221; when detecting if the DIVI builder is on to avoid loading Asset CleanUp there<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Make sure that for languages such as Arabic where the Dashboard&#8217;s menu is shown on the right side, the plugin&#8217;s icon is not misaligned<\/li>\n<li>Fix: When &#8220;Update&#8221; button is clicked on edit post\/page (Gutenberg mode), while there&#8217;s no CSS\/JS list fetched (&#8220;Fetch the assets on a button click&#8221; is on), make sure the list is not fetched after the page is saved (it&#8217;s only refreshed if it was loaded in the first place)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.7.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Make sure WP Rocket is fully triggered when the assets are fetched via Asset CleanUp, as the &#8220;Uncode&#8221; theme is calling get_rocket_option() without checking if the function exists<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Added nonce checks to AJAX calls made by Asset CleanUp for extra security<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.7.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher accuracy in detecting the source map for CSS &amp; JS files in order to update it if the caching file is created; Make sure no caching file is created if there&#8217;s no change already made to the JS content (e.g. minify), otherwise, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to only change the source map<\/li>\n<li>Delete an option related to the plugin (from {wp_}options) instead of updating it with an empty value<\/li>\n<li>Do not trigger the plugin when Zion Page Builder from Kallyas theme is used to avoid using extra resources or print any assets below the page when &#8220;Manage in the front-end&#8221; is enabled, thus, cluttering the page<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Sometimes, due to multiple query strings the optimized asset URLs weren&#8217;t replacing the original asset URLs correctly (e.g. \/?version=value&amp;ver=1.2)<\/li>\n<li>Fix (CSS Minify): Do not update &#8220;0px&#8221; to &#8220;0&#8221; from a global declared variable (e.g. &#8220;:root { &#8211;some-var: 0px; }&#8221; should not have &#8220;px&#8221; removed)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Avoid preg_match() errors coming from any RegEx from the following option: &#8220;Do not combine the (CSS|JavaScript) files matching the patterns below (one per line)&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Fix: If WordPress version is below 5, an error is generated when print_translations() is triggered because the method does not exists within wp_scripts()<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Prevent combined CSS files from generating from just one file (useless) when the array is filled twice by mistake with the same file path<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.7.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved the caching mechanism: The most recently created files are never deleted in case HTML pages that weren&#8217;t cleared for weeks or more would still load them successfully; Once &#8220;ver&#8221; is updated, then the now old file will be cleared in a couple of days (e.g. at least one day + the number of days set in &#8220;Settings&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Plugin Usage Preferences&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Clear previously cached CSS\/JS files older than (x) days&#8221;)<\/li>\n<li>Combine JS Update: Make sure the inline &#8220;translations&#8221; associated with a JS file is appended to the combined JS files, as this would also avoid possible errors such as &#8220;Uncaught ReferenceError: wp is not defined&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Set a higher priority of the order in which the plugin&#8217;s menu shows up in the top admin bar to make room for the notice related to the unloaded assets; Changed the notification icon from the menu (from exclamation to filter sign)<\/li>\n<li>Improved the way the file paths from &#8220;Inline CSS&#8221; area are matched to make sure regular expressions can also be used for a match, not just the relative path to the file<\/li>\n<li>Make sure preg_qoute() is used in CleanUp.php when clearing LINK\/SCRIPT tags to avoid any errors such as unknown modifier<\/li>\n<li>The super admin will always be able to access the plugin&#8217;s settings for security reasons<\/li>\n<li>Do not trigger the plugin when Zion Page Builder from Kallyas theme is used to avoid using extra resources or print any assets below the page when &#8220;Manage in the front-end&#8221; is enabled, cluttering the page<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Sometimes, due to the fact there were no line breaks on specific code shown in the hardcoded list, the left-side meta box had its width increased so much that it was hiding or partially showing the right-side meta boxes area that was only visible by using &#8220;View&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Zoom Out&#8221; in Google Chrome<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.7.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added notice about the unloaded rules to the plugin&#8217;s top admin bar menu (with an exclamation sign) for easier noticing the unload rules that are applied on the current visited page (\/?wpacu_debug is another way of viewing the list when the top admin bar \/ plugin&#8217;s menu is unavailable for the logged-in admin)<\/li>\n<li>If an unload exception is chosen (after an existing unload rule has already been chosen), mark it with green font to easily notice it when managing the CSS\/JS<\/li>\n<li>CSS Minifier Update: Better detection and minification for CSS related to math functions such as min(), max(), calc() and clamp(); Fix broken CSS (rare situations) that uses nested calc()<\/li>\n<li>Prevent Asset CleanUp from triggering when certain REST calls are made (e.g. the one from Thrive Ovation for testimonials) to avoid any conflicts<\/li>\n<li>Compatibility with &#8220;WordPress Admin Theme &#8211; WPShapere&#8221; plugin &#8211; make sure Asset CleanUp&#8217;s icon is not misaligned<\/li>\n<li>Better detection of the Oxygen (plugin) page builder edit mode (when the page builder is active)<\/li>\n<li>Replaced jQuery deprecated code with new one (e.g. the code is reported by plugins such as &#8220;Enable jQuery Migrate Helper&#8221;)<\/li>\n<li>Clear &#8220;Cache Enabler&#8221; cache after Asset CleanUp cache is cleared to avoid any CSS\/JS references (in the HTML source code) from \/wp-content\/cache\/asset-cleanup\/ (old files that were deleted)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: PHP Deprecated: cache_enabler_before_store (from Cache Enabled plugin) \/ Replaced it with the following filter: &#8220;cache_enabler_page_contents_before_store&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.7.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New Setting: Restrict access for administrators on the &#8220;CSS &amp; JS Manager&#8221; area, thus decluttering the posts\/pages whenever they edit them; Very useful if there are admins (e.g. store managers that don&#8217;t have to mix with Asset CleanUp&#8217;s assets list for various reasons) that should not view the meta boxes from edit post\/page, the CSS\/JS list from the front-end view (if enabled), etc. (&#8220;Settings&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Plugin Usage Preferences&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Allow managing assets to:&#8221;)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Extra checks are made to detect if the page is an AMP one and if it is, no changes would be made to the HTML source (e.g. no SCRIPT tags in the HEAD section of the page)<\/li>\n<li>Clear caching once a day via WP Cron in the case over 24 hours have passed since the last clearance (e.g. in case the admin hasn&#8217;t cleared the caching in a long time or hasn&#8217;t touched the Dashboard for days)<\/li>\n<li>Deactivate the appending of the inline CSS\/JS code (extra, before or after) to the combined CSS\/JS files if all the files&#8217; size is over 700 MB as this often suggest the inline code is not unique (e.g. having WordPress nonces that often change)<\/li>\n<li>Oxygen Builder Fix: Make sure the file \/wp-content\/uploads\/css\/universal.css is taken into consideration for minification as it&#8217;s among the files that aren&#8217;t minified by default<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Basic preloading was not taking place anymore<\/li>\n<li>Fix: &#8220;PHP Warning: in_array() expects parameter 2 to be array, boolean given&#8221; is generating if the current media query load list is empty<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Make sure \/wp-content\/cache\/asset-cleanup\/(css|js) directories are re-created if necessary, in case they were removed (e.g. for being empty or by mistake)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Prevent the meta boxes from showing up in the edit post\/page area (thus, decluttering the edit area) if the user&#8217;s role is not &#8220;administrator&#8221; (e.g. it was showing it to editors without any CSS\/JS to manage which was often confusing)<\/li>\n<li>Changed the &#8220;Plugins Manager&#8221; area to have the same feeling as the &#8220;CSS &amp; JS Manager&#8221;; Removed the &#8220;Always load it (default)&#8221; option as it&#8217;s redundant since all the plugins are loaded by default unless there are unload rules set there; The load exceptions are now showing in green font to stand out in case they overwrite any unload rule.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.7.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New option in &#8220;Settings&#8221;

\/?wpacu_no_js_preload_basic)<\/li>\n<li>Prevent the plugin from triggering on certain situations (e.g. for &#8220;Contact Form X&#8221; AJAX call and &#8220;Lumise&#8221; plugin, in edit mode)<\/li>\n<li>Check if a directory is empty before using rmdir() to avoid any errors printed (e.g. even if @ was appended in front of the function, the irrelevant errors were still logged in some environments)<\/li>\n<li>Higher accuracy in detecting older cached files to be marked for deletion (making sure older files are cleared)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Make sure \/wp-content\/cache\/asset-cleanup\/(css|js) directories are re-created if necessary, in case they were removed (e.g. for being empty or by mistake)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Basic preloading was not triggering anymore for LINK tags<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.7.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Made sure a directory exists before attempting to delete it (for old directories) to avoid any error reports (harmless, but annoying) from plugins such as &#8220;Fatal Error Notify Pro&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Updated notification related to HTTP\/2 from Combine CSS\/JS tabs within &#8220;Settings&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>If the total files from the caching directory generated by the combined CSS\/JS files occupy over 1 GB in disk space, deactivate automatically the appending of the inline CSS\/JS code associated with the tags to the generated combined CSS\/JS files as that&#8217;s usually the culprit for having so many redundant files in the caching directory, leading to unnecessary disk space<\/li>\n<li>Older caching files are by default set to be cleared after 4 days (the new default value) instead of 7<\/li>\n<li>Updated &#8220;Help&#8221; page<\/li>\n<li>Show more information about the caching directory in &#8220;Tools&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Storage Info&#8221; (each directory with CSS\/JS files is shown along with the total size of the assets within it)<\/li>\n<li>WP Rocket 3.7+ compatibility fix: &#8220;Minify HTML&#8221;

(read more: https:\/\/assetcleanup.com\/docs\/?p=957)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.6.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement: Save resources and do not check anything for optimization when the feed URL (e.g. \/feed\/) is loaded (the plugin should be inactive for these kinds of requests)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Do not trigger the plugin when WooCommerce makes AJAX calls (no point in using extra resources from Asset CleanUp)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: When Google Fonts are marked for removal, nullify other related settings, leading to the usage of fewer resources<\/li>\n<li>The strings &#8220;\/cart\/&#8221; and &#8220;\/checkout\/&#8221; are added to the exclusion list where Asset CleanUp is not triggered if the pattern is matched (read more: https:\/\/assetcleanup.com\/docs\/?p=488); These kinds of pages usually do not need optimization and if the admin decides to do some, he\/she can remove the exclusion<\/li>\n<li>Fix (writing files to cache directory): If the handle name contained forward-slash (\/), make sure that the final file name gets sanitized (including slash removal) to avoid errors related to file_put_contents() such as trying to write to directories that are non-existent<\/li>\n<li>Fix (unnecessary cached files): The plugin was caching CSS\/JS files that did not need to be cached (e.g. already minified JS), leading to unnecessary extra disk space<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;WP-Optimize&#8221; minify is not triggering anymore when \/?wpacu_clean_load is used for debugging purposes (viewing all files loading from their original location)<\/li>\n<li>Do not strip inline CSS\/JS associated with the handle if the original file is empty as there&#8217;s a high chance the inline code is needed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.6.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the plugin&#8217;s user aware about jQuery Migrate not loading starting from WordPress 5.5 (a notice is showing in &#8220;Settings&#8221;

is enabled and the admin is logged-in (e.g. ob_flush() is used to print missing content)<\/li>\n<li>Added action hooks before (&#8220;wpacu_clear_cache_before&#8221;) &amp; after (&#8220;wpacu_clear_cache_after&#8221;) the plugin&#8217;s CSS\/JS caching is cleared<\/li>\n<li>Do not deactivate the plugin automatically on Dashboard view if the PHP version is below 5.6 and when the plugin is activated, prevent its activation when the PHP version is below 5.6 printing an error message<\/li>\n<li>Yoast SEO Compatibility Fix: Prevent the plugin from minifying SCRIPT tags if the type is different than &#8220;text\/javascript&#8221;, avoiding errors with plugins such as Yoast SEO (type: application\/ld+json)<\/li>\n<li>WordPress 5.5 &amp; &#8220;Enable jQuery Migrate Helper&#8221; Fix &#8211; \/assets\/script.min.js: jQuery.fn.load() is deprecated<\/li>\n<li>When the CSS\/JS list is fetched using the &#8220;Direct&#8221; way of fetching the assets (&#8220;Manage in the Dashboard&#8221;), there are two calls made; Now the progress is shown for each of the calls for easier debugging in case the assets&#8217; list is not retrieved successfully<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Do not defer the plugin&#8217;s own script file as sometimes its functions do not work (e.g. if there are JS errors from other plugins); It&#8217;s better to have it loaded as render-blocking (small file anyway), as soon as possible<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Do not leave extra space in the LINK &amp; SCRIPT tags (it makes things easier when debugging the HTML source that might have been altered by the plugin)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Avoid triggering the plugin if the request is an API one starting with &#8220;\/wp-json\/wc\/&#8221;

so the admin will be aware if that particular CSS is meant for mobile or other devices (e.g. to save time from going through the HTML source code and check it out there)<\/li>\n<li>Files loaded from &#8220;\/wp-content\/bs-booster-cache\/&#8221; are not minified\/combined (as they are already minified) to avoid getting a large caching directory (often having lots of GB)<\/li>\n<li>Prevent certain JavaScript code containing random strings such as nonces (e.g. CDATA one) from being added to the combined JS files to avoid the plugin generating lots of JS combined files that would increase the total disk space by writing to the caching directory<\/li>\n<li>New ways to sort the list of the CSS\/JS files that are managed: &#8220;Grouped by their size (sorted in descending order)&#8221;, &#8220;Grouped by having at least one rule &amp; no rules&#8221;, &#8220;All enqueues in one list&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>At least PHP 5.6 is now required (anything below that and the plugin won&#8217;t activate). Official support for PHP 5.6 ended on December 31st, 2018.

filter hook) before WP Rocket saves the HTML content to the cached file<\/li>\n<li>Fix: After updating the the CSS\/JS manager on any page, the page preloads for the guest visitors; Make sure the response from wp_remote_get() is always checked to avoid PHP errors logged to error_log (even though the errors are harmless for the front-end view, the error log files can get too big)<\/li>\n<li>Fix (unstyled CSS\/JS management area in front-end view): Make sure the plugin&#8217;s own style is properly loaded asynchronously in Firefox in any situation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.6.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Once a page is updated, the plugin preloads that page for both the admin and the guest visitor, making sure any new changes would take effect, saving the admin&#8217;s time and making sure any first visitor coming to that page will access it faster (not having to wait for the caching to re-built)<\/li>\n<li>If the attribute &#8220;data-wpacu-skip&#8221; is applied to any CSS\/JS, then no alteration (e.g. no minify and no addition to any combine list) will be applied to that file (apart from the actual unload or attributes such as async\/defer)<\/li>\n<li>&#8216;Remove All &#8220;generator&#8221; meta tags?&#8217; improvement: Higher accuracy in stripping META tag generators if the option is enabled in case some of their attributes have no quotes around them (rare cases)<\/li>\n<li>If &#8216;Remove &#8220;REST API&#8221; link tag?&#8217; is enabled, the \/wp-json\/ reference is also removed from the &#8220;Response headers&#8221; when accessing the page via remove_action()<\/li>\n<li>Compatibility with extra page builders: &#8220;X&#8221; &amp; &#8220;PRO&#8221; themes (Theme.co), &#8220;WP Page Builder&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Page Builder: Live Composer&#8221; plugins: whenever their editor is ON, no unloads or any other changes to the HTML source (including minification) are performed to make sure the editor is loading its files and works smoothly<\/li>\n<li>Compatibility with &#8220;Redis Object Cache&#8221; plugin: The global variable $wp_object_cache from the WordPress core is no longer used and it&#8217;s replaced with a custom solution<\/li>\n<li>Compatibility with &#8220;404page \u2013 your smart custom 404 error page&#8221; plugin and similar plugins that are making pages as 404 customizable ones<\/li>\n<li>For debugging purposes, the admin can use \/?wpacu_no_cache to view how the website would load without the CSS\/JS cache applied (the files will still be referenced from the caching directory but they will be dynamically generated instead)<\/li>\n<li>Sometimes, large inline STYLE\/SCRIPT tags&#8217; content has to be minified; if it&#8217;s between 40KB and 500 KB it will be cached; any tags&#8217; content over 500KB will not be minified as it would use too many resources; it&#8217;s advisable to put very large tag content into a .js external file as it would affect the TTFB (time to the first byte) when the page is loaded<\/li>\n<li>Any inline CSS\/JS associated with a handle (generated via wp_add_inline_style() and wp_add_inline_script() respectively) are automatically added to the combined file<\/li>\n<li>Combined CSS\/JS files are all stored in \/wp-content\/cache\/asset-cleanup\/(&#8220;css&#8221; or &#8220;js&#8221;)\/ to avoid duplicated files that used to be stored in &#8220;logged-in&#8221; directory which is no longer created; This reduces the total disk space especially when the same CSS\/JS is created (sometimes these files are quite large) for both guests &amp; logged-in users<\/li>\n<li>If &#8220;Combine loaded CSS (Stylesheets) into fewer files&#8221; is enabled, the LINK tags that are preloaded (at least two of them) will also be combined, thus reducing the number of HTTP requests<\/li>\n<li>The method loadHTML() from DOMDocument is processing tags faster as the initial HTML source passed to it as a parameter goes through several filters, making it much smaller which makes a different in page speed when it comes to large HTML sources<\/li>\n<li>Prevent certain DOMDocument calls (which can be slow on large HTML documents) when they are not necessary (e.g. when preloading CSS stylesheets and the RegEx which is faster can do the same task with the same accuracy)<\/li>\n<li>Strip LINK tags that are pointing to empty content (including any inline code associated with the enqueued style added via wp_add_inline_style() function) if &#8220;CSS Files Minification&#8221; is enabled, making sure any empty tags are also stripped when &#8220;Inline CSS Files&#8221; is enabled, this saving HTTP requests and having less DOM elements<\/li>\n<li>In some cases, the PHP function strtr() has proven to be faster than str_replace() to make replacements, thus it has been applied to some methods that are dealing with the alteration of the HTML source<\/li>\n<li>Notify the admin that unloading &#8216;jquery-migrate&#8217; won&#8217;t unload it&#8217;s &#8220;child&#8221; as well, &#8216;jquery&#8217; (as it&#8217;s a special case)<\/li>\n<li>Fix: In rare cases, URLs to the assets are starting with ..\/ (it&#8217;s not the best practice as this would only work depending on the page&#8217;s URL structure); Make sure the file&#8217;s size is calculated correctly and the right URL for the file is checked in the background to determine if it returns a 200 OK response or not<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Store the assets info (which are shown only within the Dashboard for reference purposes) with the relative location (UR) to the asset, in case the data is later imported from a Staging to Live environment, it won&#8217;t show any Staging URLs on the Live website on pages such as &#8220;Overview&#8221;, thus avoiding any confusion the admin might have<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Make sure the time dequeueing CSS\/JS is calculated correctly<\/li>\n<li>Fix: If &#8220;Asynchronous via Web Font Loader (webfont.js)&#8221; was chosen for &#8220;Combine Multiple Requests Into Fewer Ones&#8221;, the font weights weren&#8217;t added to the final generated SCRIPT tag<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Make sure when the handle information is saved, there are no PHP notice errors if the &#8216;src&#8217; index is missing as some handles do not have an &#8220;src&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.6.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased the speed of unloading (dequeueing) styles &amp; scripts by ~40ms (caching is used to avoid calling the same PHP code during several action hooks)<\/li>\n<li>Higher accuracy in stripping &#8216;before&#8217; and &#8216;after&#8217; associated inline SCRIPT after adding the content to the JS combined file<\/li>\n<li>When combining JS content, make sure to extract the right relative path to make it combinable if a local file is loaded and it starts with \/\/ in the &#8220;src&#8221; attribute<\/li>\n<li>Show confirmation message when unloading specific files that are very likely needed such as jQuery, Backbone &amp; Underscore libraries<\/li>\n<li>Alert the admin when there are unload rules from inactive plugins on pages such as &#8220;Bulk Changes&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Overview&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Keep Dashicons loaded if the toolbar (top admin bar) is shown<\/li>\n<li>Prevent front-end optimisation code from triggering while the CSS\/JS is fetched, thus saving resources and improving the speed of retrieving the assets<\/li>\n<li>Optimised the plugin to use less calls to MinifyCss &amp; MinifyJs for hardcoded assets reducing considerably the resources used (sometimes timeout errors are generated in hosts with a lower resources allocated)<\/li>\n<li>When a plugin page (e.g. &#8220;Settings&#8221;) is visited within the Dashboard, trigger a maintenance script that will remove inactive handle data information (from handles without any rule attached to it, often from deleted plugins no longer used) from the &#8220;wpassetcleanup_global_data&#8221; option value (from <code>options<\/code> table), thus making it lighter<\/li>\n<li>In many hosting environments, the total number of fields submitted is maximum 1000 (set by default in php.ini); The total number of fields that were sent have been reduced (e.g. hardcoded assets information) as they are only enabled via JavaScript whenever they are relevant to make sure there are less fields sent (to void partial submit and missing data as a result in case the admin has difficulties increase the default 1000 in php.ini)<\/li>\n<li>Do not automatically store hardcoded assets info when the CSS\/JS manager list is loaded; Instead, store it IF there&#8217;s a rule attached to it in order to make the contents of the &#8220;wpassetcleanup_global_data&#8221; option smaller in size (for a lighter database &amp; faster MySQL queries)<\/li>\n<li>Clear plugin&#8217;s cache via AJAX after &#8220;Settings&#8221; is updated within the Dashboard (this is more effective then clearing it when the page reloads as it could take some time to clear the cache if there are lots of files stored there)<\/li>\n<li>Whenever Asset CleanUp&#8217;s caching is cleared, the Autoptimize (if enabled) caching is also cleared via AJAX (in an asynchronous way) to avoid any broken CSS\/JS (rare cases) even for short time<\/li>\n<li>Trigger certain actions (to save database &amp; disk space) when the plugin is deactivated: Clear all its transients from the database &amp; Remove the caching directory if it doesn&#8217;t have any more CSS\/JS; If all the plugin&#8217;s changes were cleared via &#8220;Tools&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Reset&#8221;, then deactivating the plugin will completely clear any of its traces<\/li>\n<li>The plugin&#8217;s own files that are needed for the plugin&#8217;s functionality (they are only loading for the logged-in admin), are loaded asynchronously (CSS) and deferred (JS) to ensure the admin doesn&#8217;t load them as render-blocking especially when managing the pages in the front-end view<\/li>\n<li>The combined CSS tags can now be altered for any reason via add_filter() through the &#8216;wpacu_combined_css_tag&#8217; tag name, just like the combined JS tags are via &#8216;wpacu_combined_js_tag&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>While the CSS\/JS assets are fetched prevent extra performance plugins from triggering their optimisation for CSS\/JS\/HTML as the action is irrelevant and uses resources during the fetching of the assets for the admin<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Remove request to non-existent CSS file within the Dashboard that generated a 404 Not Found error in the browser&#8217;s console (harmless, but confusing)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.6.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved the speed of the generated &amp; printed combined CSS\/JS assets by ~30ms (depending on the hosting package and the PHP version used) when the HTML source is altered by avoiding extra useless verifications of the HTML output<\/li>\n<li>When managing the assets, make sure to show &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; content (so the user is aware how is that inline tag generated) associated with a handle too (not just the &#8220;data&#8221; one added via wp_localize_script())<\/li>\n<li>When managing the assets, make sure the checkboxes from the load exception area are always disabled if there&#8217;s no unload rule set, thus avoiding any user error to mistakenly add useless load exceptions to an already loading asset, also avoiding any confusing and get a cleaner list in the &#8220;Overview&#8221; area<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Overview&#8221; page update: If there&#8217;s any &#8220;Load it for the logged-in user&#8221; exception for a handle, show it<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Avoid creating redundant CSS files when minify inlined tags is enabled, leading to a large number of files in the caching<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.5.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed unused files from &#8220;vendor&#8221; (Composer&#8217;s directory) and updated the Minify CSS\/JS library to the latest version, fixing errors for PHP 7.4+<\/li>\n<li>Fix: In some cases, a 500 Internal Error was generated while fetching the assets list for management via the Dashboard view<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.5.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Caching: Expired CSS\/JS files are cleared differently (in time after visiting various pages) to save resources and errors related to the PHP memory (e.g. shared hosting packages often have limitations in terms of the server&#8217;s CPU &amp; memory usage)<\/li>\n<li>Allow CSS\/JS management for privately published pages<\/li>\n<li>Strip empty STYLE\/SCRIPT tags if, after optimization, their content is empty (e.g. the CSS was minified as it had only comments in it)<\/li>\n<li>Show if there are any hardcoded (non-enqueued) LINK\/STYLE\/SCRIPT tags in the list of CSS\/JS list (management of these tags is available in the Pro version)<\/li>\n<li>Make sure the combined CSS\/JS file is valid before its tag is generated in the HTML output (in rare cases, the cached CSS\/JS files get deleted either by mistake when developers are cleaning up the caching directory OR they weren&#8217;t properly created in the first place)<\/li>\n<li>Compatibility fix to avoid PHP warning error when &#8220;Smart Slider 3&#8221; &amp; &#8220;WP Rocket&#8221; are used and the CSS\/JS assets are fetched<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.5.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the admin aware in case a certain CSS\/JS asset is loaded within Internet Explorer conditional comments (Read more: https:\/\/www.sitepoint.com\/internet-explorer-conditional-comments\/)<\/li>\n<li>From now on, &#8220;disk&#8221; is the default method for storing the cached information of the assets<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Make sure the path to \/wp-includes\/ (or other internal directories) is the right one when the blog URL is like mysite.com\/blog\/<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Sometimes, warning errors were printed in the &#8220;Settings&#8221; page after an update (within the Dashboard): &#8220;Warning: array_search() expects parameter 2 to be array, null given&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.5.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added &#8220;Debugging&#8221; tab to &#8220;Tools&#8221; page, allowing the option to download the error log file &amp; view other debugging options<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Sometimes, 200 OK (success) is returned, but due to an issue with the page, the assets list is not retrieved; Notify the admin about this<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Sometimes, warnings (harmless, but obtrusive) were given when updating plugin&#8217;s settings and previewing pages: &#8220;Warning: array_unique() expects parameter 1 to be array, null given&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.5.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Minify CSS library for PHP 7.4 support (avoid any PHP errors from &#8220;implode&#8221; function)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: &#8220;display=&#8221; is now also applied to Google Fonts loading via WebFontConfig within inline SCRIPT tags<\/li>\n<li>FileSystem is always using the &#8220;direct&#8221; method for altering CSS\/JS files, thus avoiding (e.g. by mistake via a different plugin using the same WordPress FileSystem class) any reading\/writing error for the cached files<\/li>\n<li>When fetching assets, make sure some plugins such as Fast Velocity Minify (that could interfere with the HTML output) are deactivated<\/li>\n<li>When updating a post\/page\/homepage, the caching is now cleared after the page is updated via an AJAX call (asynchronously), thus reducing the memory usage and the time spent until the page reloads<\/li>\n<li>Debugging feature: If \/?wpacu_clean_load is used, it will show the unoptimized version of the page (great for locating specific files that were perhaps combined and cached by various plugins)<\/li>\n<li>Removed Freemius SDK<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.5.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New Feature: Stop triggering Asset CleanUp (early stop) on specific front-end pages<\/li>\n<li>New Feature: Easier way to deactivate options for debugging purposes on page load via \/?wpacu_debug (printing an options area at the bottom of any front-end page for the logged-in admin)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Removed plugin&#8217;s meta boxes when a block is edited in Oxygen (as the meta boxes are not relevant there)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Compressed images for a lighter plugin<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Do not trigger Asset CleanUp if TranslatePress Multilingual plugin is in edit mode (front-end view)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Storage info for cache directory shows the total size\/number of all files (not just CSS\/JS ones)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: On page request (within the Dashboard), \/wp-admin\/?wpacu_get_cache_dir_size will retrieve information about the caching directory (e.g. all its files and their sizes get listed)<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Avoid any PHP errors or very high CPU usage with some hosting packages in case a &#8220;circular reference&#8221; error is detected (e.g. an @import from a CSS file that is having the URL path to the same CSS file)<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: CSS\/JS URLs starting with \/\/ were giving unreachable error when checked if they are valid or not (e.g. from \/\/fonts.googleapis.com\/)<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix (plugin compatibility): Remove call_user_func_array() PHP error if SiteGround&#8217;s &#8220;Remove Query String From Static Resources&#8221; is enabled<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Prevent errors in some BuddyPress pages as $post-&gt;post_type is undefined<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.5.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New Feature: Make exception (from any unload rule) and load an asset if the user is logged in<\/li>\n<li>Adjust the text below &#8220;CSS &amp; JS Manager&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Bulk Changes&#8221; to keep it on the same line<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Added the total number of handles for stylesheets and scripts in &#8220;Overview&#8221; page<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Sometimes, specific plugins are used to alter the HTML source (e.g. features such as minify HTML); Make sure no META tags are left in the BODY tag as it would give validation errors in https:\/\/validator.w3.org\/<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: In rare cases, the version of a CSS\/JS could be an array, not just a float\/integer number; Prevent notices from showing up when &#8216;ver&#8217; is an array and make sure the proper query string is passed to the link\/path of the source file<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.5.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement: Added &#8220;Overview&#8221; page which has the list of all the changes made to a specific CSS\/JS file (handle), offering a much easier way to understand the changes made and do any debugging<\/li>\n<li>UI Improvement: The height of the CSS\/JS asset row (when managing the list) is smaller, depending on the settings, making it easier to do scrolling<\/li>\n<li>UI Improvement: Adjust the total height of the &#8220;Note&#8221; textarea based on the content added, thus reducing the spacing between assets for easier scrolling\/management<\/li>\n<li>Code Improvement: Split a few large files into multiple ones for easier management<\/li>\n<li>Backend Performance Improvement: Prevent Asset CleanUp&#8217;s (own) CSS\/JS from loading in edit post\/page when the files aren&#8217;t needed (e.g. no meta boxes are showing up because they were hidden)<\/li>\n<li>Extra compatibility with AMP pages: Do not move from HEAD to BODY any SCRIPT tags containing \/\/cdn.ampproject.org\/<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Do not alter any Google Fonts links if there is no &#8220;family=&#8221; within it (&#8220;Smart Slider 3&#8221; fix)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.5.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug Fix: Prevent PHP notice errors from showing up in error log reports (not affecting the plugin&#8217;s functionality)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement for debugging purposes: Change the &#8220;Settings&#8221; values on page-request (via query string)<\/li>\n<li>Debugging Improvement: When \/?wpacu_show_handle_names is used, it will print the handle name as a &#8220;data&#8221; attribute tag within the LINK\/SCRIPT; Great for debugging and to find out if any of the assets are hardcoded<\/li>\n<li>Make sure Asset CleanUp&#8217;s combine CSS\/JS works if &#8220;HTML Minify&#8221; is enabled in W3 Total Cache<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.5.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug Fix: Sometimes, when external URLs (from a different domain) were present in the assets management list, when checking them via JavaScript for their status, the browser returned some errors interfering with &#8220;Add Media&#8221; not allowing the user to upload new images from the edit post\/page area<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.4.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New Feature: Check if the CSS\/JS files are reachable; Once the Assets List is loaded for management, AJAX calls would be made to check if the files are not returning 404 not found errors and anyone that returns an &#8220;error&#8221; gets highlighted (e.g. it&#8217;s good in situations when a file was enqueued, but later deleted and forgotten thus ending up with 404 Bad Requests in the browser)<\/li>\n<li>UI Improvement for &#8220;Bulk Changes&#8221;: When a checkbox is ticked, highlight the area of the targeted handle (applies for any results in all the tabs)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Automatic compatibility added for &#8220;WP AMP \u2014 Accelerated Mobile Pages for WordPress and WooCommerce&#8221; (premium plugin)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: For easier reference (determining where a handle is coming from: a plugin, the theme etc.), more information such as the source and the version number is added next to each handle in &#8220;Bulk Changes&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Once the management CSS\/JS list gets loaded, AJAX calls would be made to determine if the source (URL) would return a successful response or not. If a 404 is retrieved or any other error code, then the source URL would be in red color along with a notice the page might load unreachable (bad requests) CSS\/JS<\/li>\n<li>PHP 7.4 Compatibility Fix: Removed deprecated errors for &#8220;Array and string offset access syntax with curly braces is deprecated&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>WordPress 4.3 CSS Fix: In the new WP version, some buttons and drop-downs (selects) were unaligned and showing incomplete text<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.4.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility with &#8220;AMP (Official AMP Plugin for WordPress)&#8221; and &#8220;AMP for WP \u2013 Accelerated Mobile Pages&#8221; plugins: If the page is of AMP type, no Asset CleanUp settings\/rules will be triggered to avoid validation errors; Moreover, NOSCRIPT tags added by Asset CleanUp are moved to the BODY tag (they are no longer stored in the HEAD tag) to avoid further validation errors in case other AMP plugins\/scripts are used and Asset CleanUp doesn&#8217;t detect them<\/li>\n<li>New Feature: Skip &#8220;Test Mode&#8221; on page request for debugging purposes via \/?wpacu_skip_test_mode &#8211; e.g. useful when you have to check a website and you don&#8217;t have admin access and &#8220;Test Mode&#8221; is enabled (you can check if anything is broken there while the page loads fine for other visitors)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Changed the way the assets list is showing up for management by reducing the size of each row (with CSS\/JS file details) so it&#8217;s easier for scrolling (e.g. load exceptions are showing up only if you chosen a bulk unload option, reduced the height of some of the areas, such as &#8220;Handle:&#8221;, &#8220;Source:&#8221; and notes area).<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: The number of total submitted fields is smaller now as the assets list area is not as cluttered since irrelevant fields are not submitted anymore with an empty value (this is not only useful for aesthetic reasons, but it&#8217;s limiting the risk of submitting over 1000 fields where max_input_vars from php.ini is limited to only 1000 inputs)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: No matter what type of layout to show the assets list is chosen from &#8220;Assets List Layout:&#8221;, it will show the total number of CSS\/JS for each group (e.g. total files from the theme, total files from all the active plugins, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: Option to choose how the caching information (asset details including its location in the caching directory) is retrieved in &#8220;Plugin Usage Preferences&#8221; (useful to reduce database queries in case one has a large database that is slow in retrieving information)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement: If all CSS\/JS from a plugin (when the assets list is grouped by location) are bulk unloaded (e.g. on all posts, site-wide), then &#8220;Unload on this page&#8221; (Check All | Uncheck All) (which becomes irrelevant) is replaced with &#8216;Make an exception from bulk unload, &#8220;Load it on this page&#8221;&#8216; (Check All | Uncheck All)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.4.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement: When assets are fetched to show in the load manager, prevent WP Rocket from running as well as Query Monitor from outputting information<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Duplicate Post&#8221; compatibility fix: Make sure Asset CleanUp&#8217;s meta values are taken into account when a post is cloned<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Hide any PHP notice errors (reported in the error log in some environments) for cached CSS\/JS as the 3rd parameter (&#8220;src&#8221; as it is) wasn&#8217;t added to the returned array<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.4.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New Feature in &#8220;Optimize JavaScript&#8221;: Move jQuery Inline Code After jQuery library is called<\/li>\n<li>Combine Google Fonts Improvement: Strip any extra characters (like double comma ,,) from existing LINK tags pointing to fonts.googleapis.com (more info: https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/topic\/preload-google-fonts\/)<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Prevent notice errors from showing up on certain hosting environments in Misc.php (in case fetching plugins&#8217; icons from WordPress.org fails) and CleanUp.php<\/li>\n<li>Added more tutorials to &#8220;Getting Started&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Video Tutorials&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.4.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement: Hardcoded LINK\/SCRIPT tags that have relative URLs (no site url added to them) are also checked for optimization (e.g. )<\/li>\n<li>Cache Dynamic Assets Improvement: It also checks for www.domain.com?query type of URLs without forward slash \/ after the domain&#8217;s extension);<\/li>\n<li>Inline JS automatically is no longer enabled by default (new installations); A note was added about what it means to inline JS files so the user will be extra careful<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: &#8216;Ignore dependency rule and keep the &#8220;children&#8221; loaded&#8217; wasn&#8217;t working properly for SCRIPT tags in 1.3.4.4 due to the wrong parameter passed to strip the HTML tag<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.4.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Inline automatically CSS smaller then (specific size) KB (if option is enabled)<\/li>\n<li>Inline CSS Improvement: Inline dynamic loaded CSS (if option is enabled)<\/li>\n<li>Improvement for &#8220;Google Font Remove&#8221;: Added more patterns to detect Web Font Loader CDN requests<\/li>\n<li>WP Rocket Compatibility Fix: If the CSS\/JS files&#8217; path get changed by &#8220;WP Rocket&#8221; (path contains &#8220;\/wp-content\/cache\/busting\/&#8221;), make sure they are getting unloaded by Asset CleanUp if &#8216;Ignore dependency rule and keep the &#8220;children&#8221; loaded&#8217; option is checked along with the unload rule<\/li>\n<li>New Feature: Rewrite cached static assets URLs with the CDN ones if necessary (located in &#8220;Settings&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;CDN: Rewrite assets URLs&#8221;)<\/li>\n<li>Strip Google Fonts references from JavaScript (.js) files (if the removal option is active)<\/li>\n<li>Append &#8220;display&#8221;

from &#8220;Tools&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.4.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New Assets Management Feature: Until now, the list was loaded automatically on edit post, page, custom post type, and taxonomy. You can choose to fetch the list when clicking on a button. This is good when you rarely manage loaded CSS\/JS and want to declutter the edit page on load and also save resources as AJAX calls to the front-end won&#8217;t be made to retrieve the assets&#8217; list.<\/li>\n<li>New Feature: Cache Dynamic Loaded CSS &amp; JavaScript to avoid loading the whole WP environment and save resources on each request (e.g. \/?custom-css=value_here or \/wp-content\/plugins\/plugin-name-here\/js\/generate-script-output.php?ver=1)<\/li>\n<li>Reduced the number of database queries to fetch cached information making the pages preload faster (when the caching is rebuilt) thus reducing the loading time especially if PHP 5.6 is still used (which is slower than PHP 7+ when it deals with database connections).<\/li>\n<li>Combine JS files improvement: If there are multiple files that have &#8220;defer&#8221; or &#8220;async&#8221; attribute set (or both) and they are not preloaded, then they will be grouped into fewer files; Before, only SCRIPT tags without these attributes were combined<\/li>\n<li>Improvement to reduce disk space: Make sure already minified (100%) static .js files aren&#8217;t cached<\/li>\n<li>Google Fonts Optimization: Requests that are for icons (e.g. https:\/\/fonts.googleapis.com\/icon?family=Material+Icons) are also combined to reduce HTTP requests<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Optimize CSS Delivery&#8221; from WP Rocket works together with &#8220;Inline Chosen CSS Files&#8221; from Asset CleanUp<\/li>\n<li>Prevent plugin from loading when Themify Builder (iFrame) is used<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Sometimes, the position of an asset (HEAD or BODY) is reported incorrectly if it was enqueued in specific action hooks; Extra checks are made to fix that as sometimes developers do not use wp_enqueue_scripts() which is the proper hook to use when enqueuing items that are meant to appear on the front end<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: If CSS files get inlined, make sure @import without &#8220;url&#8221; is updated correctly in all situations<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: In rare cases, managing assets for the Homepage is not working properly. Reason: $post is overwritten by external plugins or the theme because the developers have forgotten to use wp_reset_postdata() and reset it to its initial value (which should be 0 in this case).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.4.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New Feature: Remove Google Font Requests (including link\/font preloads, @import\/@font-face from CSS files &amp; STYLE tags, resource hints)<\/li>\n<li>Minify\/Combine CSS Improvement: Any @import found including a local CSS in another CSS file is fetched (and minified\/optimized if necessary) and added to the parent file (this reduces HTTP requests, saving additional round-trip times to the overall page load) &#8211; Read more: https:\/\/gtmetrix.com\/avoid-css-import.html<\/li>\n<li>Hardcoded CSS\/JS (not enqueued the WordPress way) from the same domain (local) get minified\/optimized<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: In rare cases, when viewing the homepage assets in the Dashboard, the wrong page is checked (e.g. a post instead of the actual homepage) because specific themes\/plugins do not use wp_reset_postdata() to restore $post global to its original value (none in this instance)<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: If Google Fonts loading type is async (optional with preload) then make sure it&#8217;s applied even if there&#8217;s only one LINK request<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.4.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Combined CSS files are now grouped by the LINKs media attribute (before, only &#8220;all&#8221; (default) stylesheets were combined); e.g. if there are three &#8220;print&#8221; stylesheet and four &#8220;only screen and (max-width: 1024px)&#8221;, then two separate combined CSS files will be created for each media type<\/li>\n<li>Make sure the &#8220;media&#8221; attribute is always added to the STYLE tag if a certain one (besides &#8216;all&#8217;) was set<\/li>\n<li>If Google Fonts loading type is async (optional with preload) then make sure it&#8217;s applied even if there&#8217;s only one LINK<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: If the relative path to a font\/background image in a CSS file started with .\/ the full path to the file wasn&#8217;t updated when copied to the cache<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.4.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New feature: Inline Chosen CSS files (usually small ones) saving the overhead of fetching them resulting in fewer HTTP requests (more: https:\/\/varvy.com\/pagespeed\/inline-small-css.html \/ https:\/\/gtmetrix.com\/inline-small-css.html)<\/li>\n<li>New Option to load Google Fonts: Asynchronous by preloading the CSS stylesheet<\/li>\n<li>Reduced redundant CSS\/JS files cached for logged-in users, thus making clearing the caching faster and reducing the total disk space (sometimes, on certain hosting environments with lower memory limit clearing the whole caching resulted in &#8220;PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of (X) bytes exhausted&#8221;)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3.3.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Option to disable &#8220;Freemius Analytics &amp; Insights?&#8221; in &#8220;Settings&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Plugin Usage Preferences&#8221; (good if you do debugging &amp; often deactivate the plugin or you just don&#8217;t like plugin feedback popups)<\/li>\n<li>Changed the vertical &#8220;Settings&#8221;

If &#8220;Defer loading JavaScript combined files&#8221; is enabled in &#8220;Optimize JavaScript&#8221;, make sure that any external script between the first and last combined JS tags has &#8220;defer&#8221; attribute applied to it to avoid any JS errors in case a &#8220;child&#8221; JS file is loaded before a combined &#8220;parent&#8221; one.<\/li>\n<li>Option to minify inline content between from STYLE and SCRIPT (without any &#8220;src&#8221;

and &#8220;Asynchronous via Web Font Loader (webfont.js)&#8221; when loading the combined Google Font requests<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: Sometimes the dynamically created drop-down from &#8220;Hide all meta boxes for the following public post types&#8221;
