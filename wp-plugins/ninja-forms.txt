The increased functionality of the scalable paid upgrade levels allow this to do almost anything you can imagine in an interactive  public UI put\/get environment.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Below is an excerpt from an actual message I sent to a client of mine after spending the night successfully setting up what I had previously referred to as their \"wishing on a star while drunk\" web form expectations (using a Pro* License.)<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">\"I am unbelievably impressed with everything that this thing can do. You have to have a basic understanding of conditional logic, but this thing has open ended, no horizon logic. So, anything that can be thought up, is basically possible. The logic chain on this one form has the 2 initial conditions which then chain to like 10 different conditions which simultaneously add and take away fields and sections from the form automatically, with mathematical calculations at each point in the chain, with several of them having chained conditions attached at each point. Like this can be set to do multi step math equations which fully adhere to PEMDAS (Order of operations in a webform?)<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">It is crazy, but I could set this up to chart both astrological and astronomical points in the future, depending on whether I wanted to start a sleazy side business or even worse, launch rockets at the moon. It will do it. It's genius. Ok, I'll quit praising this thing, but yeah. I am going to have to pick up a license for this thing myself, cuz it will solve problems on a number of sites I manage. Problems I didn't even know I had until I saw the way this thing worked.\"<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">*Out of the box, the free version is the most capable web form plugin I've ever seen. Like, it is to Web Forms what aircraft carriers are to theme park boat rides.
