If you have a complez theme and the shortcode keeps appearing at the top of the page rather than where you place it then this could help. Only switch this on in the settings of it is needed. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can now use shortcode attributes to add more than one OwnerFeed to your web site, which is ideal for multi-nit operators. Please be aware that TripAdvisor terms and conditions for ownerfeeds means no moe than 50 feeds per web site. Contact them if you need more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use the shortcode attribute name, url and id to add a feed. Any attribute not filled in will be taken from the main settings page.
