(Genesis 2:2,3 ; Isaiah 58:13,14 ; Amos 8:5 ; Nehemiah 10: 31 ; Jeremiah 17:21,22 ; Matthew 6:33 ; Acts 16:13)<\/p>\n<p>You can input specific page URLs to redirect to a certain page URL during the Sabbath and\/or specified Holy days. This is useful for e-commerce sites or any site that has online purchasing. It will automatically start redirecting when the Sabbath or Holy days begin, and stop re-directing afterwards.<\/p>\n<p>The timing is based on the understanding that Biblical days begin at sunset and end at sunset the following day.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the 7th-day Sabbath, this means from sundown Fri. to sundown Sat. it will automatically redirect with no extra configuration from you. <\/li>\n<li>For Biblical holy days (Passover, Pentacost, etc) this means that the day will start sundown the day prior to the day you specify in the admin Holy Day Dates setting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Setting up<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to the Keep Sabbath settings by either clicking the Settings link on the plugins page, or through the Settings &gt; Keep Sabbath menu in the sidebar.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Use a latitude\/longitude finder online to find the right coordinates from your address and input them into the Latitude and Longitude fields.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Optionally, input dates of Holy Days into the Holy day dates field, one per line in the MM\/DD\/YYYY format.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Input page names into the Page URLs field, one per line. These are the pages you want to redirect during the Sabbath or a Holy day.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Input the page name of the page you want vistors to be redirect to on the Sabbath or Holy days in the Redirect to page URL field.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the Save Changes button, and you&#8217;re done!
