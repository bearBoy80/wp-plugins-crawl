Plugin worked perfectly to combine reviews across products. We also had some custom requirements that Ahmad was able to take care of right away. Ahmad also found a CSS issue on our side that we had missed. Great plugin, very helpful support, timely communication.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-combined-reviews.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"reviews":"reviews","woocommerce":"woocommerce","woocommerce-reviews":"woocommerce reviews"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
