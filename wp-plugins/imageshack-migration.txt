How are you doing? A. I&#8217;m fine, thanks!<\/p>\n<p>Q. Why do I need this. A. If have been uploading pictures to your own blog for a while, you should be starting to<br \/>\nregret this, as it will affect the performance of your blog, tracing back your steps and moving<br \/>\nall post pictures to image hosting websites can take a very long time, that&#8217;s were ImageShack<br \/>\nMigration comes in to do everything for you automatically and safely.<\/p>\n<p>Q.Will this move my post attachments as well? A. Nope, but I have another plugin that will, it?s called &#8220;WordPress FileFactory&#8221; look it up the<br \/>\nWordPress repo.<\/p>\n<p>Q.This is not working!! A. You will have to be more specific.<\/p>\n<p>Q.An error is saying that the imageshack url is unreachable. A. Well most free webhosts have blocked the &#8220;fopen&#8221; command that is used to load content from<br \/>\nremote pages. This is needed for this plugin to function, so if you are on a free server, then<br \/>\nyou are out of luck, sorry.<\/p>\n<p>Q. I get an error saying that imageshack.us can&#8217;t open url. A. Some hosts have a feature that blocks &#8220;Hotlinking&#8221; which is other websites reading your<br \/>\npictures without loading your pages, you need to disable this for a second to allow imageshack<br \/>\nto snatch your pictures. Ask your host provider in necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Q. Sometimes, a Timeout error shows up, what&#8217;s up with that? A. It is ok if imageshack times out when reading one or two of your pictures, don&#8217;t worry, just<br \/>\ntry again later.<\/p>\n<p>Q. So why 10 pics only? A. this script can cause a huge pressure on your server&#8217;s php process if allowed to run<br \/>\neverything in one go. Also we will have to be gentle with the imageshack servers.<\/p>\n<p>Q. your plugin is ugly. A. so is your mom.<\/p>\n<p>Q. So do I need to keep this ImageShack Migration thingy running after I transfer all my<br \/>\npictures? A. Yes you do!<\/p>\n<p>Q. Why? A. Well, because first I hate modifying people&#8217;s posts, I don&#8217;t want to end up nuking anyone&#8217;s<br \/>\nposts by mistake, a filter is the safer resolve. This plug in will exchange the original picture<br \/>\nwith the imageshack copy before it is shown to the user and that&#8217;s it. Once you disable the<br \/>\nplugin, you will revert to your original pictures\/<\/p>\n<p>Q. So will this delete my pictures. A. nope, it will just make a copy, you don&#8217;t want to risk deleting your pictures. it can turn<br \/>\nugly if imageshack deletes some of your pictures<\/p>\n<p>Q. You seem kinda nice, can I get you a cup of coffee? A. That&#8217;s sweet of you! You can always buy me a cup of coffee by going to http:\/\/angrybyte.com\/donate<\/p>\n<p>Q. I can&#8217;t pay you a cup of coffee, is that ok? A. it certainly is, just do what you can, say thanks at my blog, rate the plugins, and spread<br \/>\nthe word about it. My motto is &#8220;Make the internet a free place to take and to give&#8221;<\/p>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/imageshack-migration.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"auto":"auto","batch-upload":"batch upload","file-sharing":"file sharing","images":"images","imageshack":"Imageshack","performance":"performance","pictures":"pictures"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"http:\/\/angrybyte.com\/donate","banners":[]}
