The point is that Names can be long, and Descriptions can be even longer, otherwise they simply don&#8217;t make sense. And besides, the same Interactive Control Unit 0n requires a lot of space and takes up half the width of the Form List table.<\/p>\n<p>It is possible that the &#8220;Description&#8221; field is not used by many. And therefore, the developers did not bother about this. Although, the developers could also make the List Customization option.<br \/>\nBut if there are really many Forms, then the Description is simply necessary.<\/p>\n<p>This Plugin gives you this opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>If you are reading this, then you are using the &#8220;Gravity Forms&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Gravity View&#8221; plugins.
