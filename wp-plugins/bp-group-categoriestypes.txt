This plugin allows you to create an unlimited hierarchy of groups.<br \/>\nThis plugin currently allows you to create two different types of groups.  Category and User groups, category groups are what allow you<br \/>\nto create the hierarchy of groups.  Category groups do not have members attached to them.  When you visit a category group you<br \/>\nwill see two extra sub nav items, Sub Categories and Groups.  The Sub Categories page displays all the category groups categorized under<br \/>\nthe group you are currently viewing.  The Groups page displays all the groups (which are user created) that are also categorized<br \/>\nunder the group you&#8217;re currently viewing.  Category Groups can only be created by the site admin, they can be created in wp-admin<br \/>\nor you can choose to create a category group instead of a user group when you visit \/groups\/create.<\/p>\n<h3>Notes<\/h3>\n<p>License.txt &#8211; contains the licensing details for this component.<\/p>\n<h3>Roadmap<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Better activity integration<\/li>\n<li>Create a super group which everyone belongs to and allow people to post to it via \/forums<\/li>\n<li>Add a tab in the groups directory for each global group created<\/li>\n<li>Exclude Certain plugins from being active inside certain categories (Allowing you to create different group types)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Bugs<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If a user only finishes the first group creation step the group is created, but group_type and parent_cat meta is never set.<br \/>\nCauses the effected group to not be included in the hierarchy.
