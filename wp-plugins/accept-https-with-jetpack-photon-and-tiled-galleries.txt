It does this by resizing and optimizing the images, and by delivering them from multiple server locations. The <strong>Jetpack Tiled Galleries<\/strong> module also uses the wordpress.com CDN, even on a site that doesn\u2019t have <strong>Jetpack Photon<\/strong> enabled, which can significantly improve page load time when tiled galleries are present.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why would I bother using this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, <strong>Jetpack<\/strong> version 3.8.2 and earlier <strong>does not<\/strong> use the wordpress.com CDN on a site that uses HTTPS. The <strong>Accept HTTPS with Jetpack Photon and Tiled Galleries<\/strong> plugin is offered as a convenient way to enable and disable use of the wordpress.com CDN on a site that uses HTTPS. If you\u2019re comfortable editing PHP, you might prefer a DIY approach using the line of code shown in the description. For example, you could add it to functions.php in a child theme.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I have Jetpack 3.9 or later. Do I need this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, <strong>Jetpack<\/strong> version 3.9 and later <strong>does<\/strong> use the wordpress.com CDN on a site that uses HTTPS, so this plugin is not required.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>My site doesn\u2019t use HTTPS. Do I need this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no reason to install this plugin on a site that doesn\u2019t use HTTPS, regardless of which version of <strong>Jetpack<\/strong> is installed.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I installed and activated this plugin, but nothing changed.

I have installed and run a ssl certificate and after this photon was still working. But i have installed your plugin anyway... so, my question is: is your plugin still necessary to run photon under an ssl site?
