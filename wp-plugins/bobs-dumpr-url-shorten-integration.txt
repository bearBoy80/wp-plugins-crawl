To get an API key all you need to do is create an account, then you can generate them from the Profile page.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This plugin provides an interface with the <a href=\"http:\/\/dumpr.info\/url\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">dumpr.info<\/a> api to generate short URLs for blog posts. It has a control panel built into the WordPress administration where you can fetch and manage them. URLs can be set to be automatically generated every time you add a post or not.<\/p>\n<p>When a short URL is generated, it is attached to the post under the custom field dumpr-shorturl. You can render that out in your theme or where ever.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin also provides nice functions that other plugins could use to integrate whatever services they need into the short URL system as well (like a plugin that posts to Twitter or Facebook, for example)<\/p>\n<h4>About dumpr.info<\/h4>\n<p>dumpr.info is a text dump and url shortening site. The URL shortening is unique because each URL has a &#8211; or a ~ in it. This character tells you what is going to happen. If the URL has a straight bar, (-) then the short URL will go straight to the original. If the URL has a curvy bar (~) then it will not go straight to the original, instead taking a detour to a preview page that shows the original link and a screenshot.<\/p>\n<p>You can view all the URLs you have added by logging into the site with the account that owns the API key used.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>bob-dumpr<\/code> to the <code>wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>????<\/li>\n<li>Profit.
