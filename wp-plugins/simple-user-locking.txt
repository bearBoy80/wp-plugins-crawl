Works also great with the multisite user management area.<\/p>\n<p>The locked users are easily manageable within the users overview page. The settings are within the user edit pages.<\/p>\n<p>No user can lock himself. No user with a lower role can lock a higher user and administrators in a network can not lock super administrators.<\/p>\n<p>If a user is locked, he is instantly logged out of any session until the lock expires or is removed.<\/p>\n<p>No useless overhead, no ads. Just a tiny, but very effective plugin to keep your website secure.<\/p>\n<p>Use cases:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you do not want to delete a user, but you want to make sure he can not access the site (at least for a certain timeframe)<\/li>\n<li>an employee leaves your company and access should be removed, but you want to keep his user as an author in the system<\/li>\n<li>you want to punish a certain user which did bad things for a certain timeframe<\/li>\n<li>you want only few persons to have access to your WordPress site in order to minimize risk of incidents<\/li>\n<li>&#8230; or maybe some other use case<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Feature requests<\/h3>\n<p>Currently none.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.<\/p>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>plugin-name.php<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Navigate to a users profile you want to lock (also possible in network admin) and adjust the settings accordingly.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"<p>Currently none.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/simple-user-locking\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2117550\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/simple-user-locking\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2117550\" alt=\"Lock settings in the user edit screen\"><\/a><p>Lock settings in the user edit screen<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/simple-user-locking\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2117550\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/simple-user-locking\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2117550\" alt=\"User overview\"><\/a><p>User overview<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/simple-user-locking\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2117550\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/simple-user-locking\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2117550\" alt=\"Trying to login with a locked account\"><\/a><p>Trying to login with a locked account<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Already successfully used in live environments<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/blackbam\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f780569131dfe188d046085499cfd1bd?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f780569131dfe188d046085499cfd1bd?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/blackbam\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Blackbam<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 4, 2019<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">The motivation behind writing this plugin was very practical - how can I lock users within my WordPress site without deleting them.
