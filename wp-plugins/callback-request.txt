to add a call back request form to your website using a simple shortcode.<\/p>\n<p>The form asks for the following details for the user:<\/p>\n<pre><code>- Name\n- Phone Number\n- Most suitable time for callback\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Once the user fills in the form and clicks on the request callback button an email will be sent to your email address showing you the details of the request.<br \/>\nBy doing this it allows you to quickly add this task as a reminder to your phone or email client so you can easily get in touch with your prospective client at a time that suits them.<\/p>\n<p>Along with the front end form there is a small backend configuration which allows you to set the following information:<\/p>\n<pre><code>- The email address to send reminders from.\n- Your email address to send the reminders to.\n- The email subject.\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The backend also gives you some simple styling information to allow you to set the colours of the request button using simple colour pickers to fit in with your website and also set the alignment of the request callback button.<\/p>\n<p>Included Translations:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>German

little differently and I am asking you if it's possible to make that happen.\nI am building a project website where members posts a request and other members post a reply stating they can complete\/do that request.\nThis is what I need (would like): I want exactly this to work from the front end for members how post a request which means this would have to work something like this.\n\nMember clicks on (create post) and fills in post details within provided options and entering their email address if they want to use this option (or have it automatically linked to each members email addresses when they register would also work which then would mean they would need a check-box if they choose to use it) and on the front end other members that reply to do the task could also request a callback if they want more details supplying the same details you have already there.\n\nSo really the only alteration would be to the back end to attach it to all members email address as they register attach it to the create posts page (best option so it could be used with any plug-in) would be using a shortcode.\n\nAnyway that's how I see this working and it would be super fantastic if I could have something like that on my website.\n\nlet me know if you can make this happen and if there would be any costs involved if you can.\n\nAlso a great idea for an extra plug-in for you as well.\n\nCheers<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/callback-request.1.4.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/callback-request\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=687954","caption":"Administration
