Previously, reloads would occur offline and cause the page content to be lost.\n\nWhile this author has done a great job of taking the code and putting it into a Wordpress plugin (tell me where I can donate). It omits mention of the original project and authors\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/HubSpot\/offline\n\nI would love to see an update, that controls where the offline plugin will load (turn on or off for pages, and apply to pages, posts, non-authenticated and backend separately please).\n\nOtherwise thank you and 5 stars for simply finding this and making it a plugin.\n\nI've since modified the original code to add the newest offline.min.js but have disabled it can inserted the needed code into single pages via the \"Header and Foot Scripts\" plugin.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/offline-indicator.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/offline-indicator\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=795645","caption":"Indicator on top of the admin side"}},"tags":{"connection-lost-message":"connection lost message","currently-offline":"currently offline","gmail-like-connectivity-alert":"gmail like connectivity alert","internet-disconnection-alert":"internet disconnection alert","lost-internet-connection":"lost internet connection","offline-alert":"offline alert","offline-indicator":"offline indicator","offline-js":"offline.js","reconnecting":"reconnecting"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/offline-indicator\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=795645","high":false}}
