Basically, this is an internal event that occurs every time a code block is executed, marked (roughly) by a function call or curly {} brackets.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin uses ticks to collect a list of the functions that were executed, how often they were called and how much time they took in total. The plugin\u2019s option page gives some filters to select and sort the results. This will give developers clues which parts of their code demand scrutiny.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/theme-plugin-profiler<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Use the Tools-&gt;T&amp;P Profiler screen to configure the plugin<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.1 (April, 2016)<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First stable version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/theme-plugin-profiler\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1444542\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/theme-plugin-profiler\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1444542\" alt=\"Options page\"><\/a><p>Options page<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/theme-plugin-profiler\/trunk\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1444542\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/theme-plugin-profiler\/trunk\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1444542\" alt=\"Sample output\"><\/a><p>Sample output<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/theme-plugin-profiler.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/theme-plugin-profiler\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1444542","caption":"Options page"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/theme-plugin-profiler\/trunk\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1444542","caption":"Sample output"}},"tags":{"developers":"developers","plugins":"plugins","themes":"themes"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/theme-plugin-profiler\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1391579","high":false}}
