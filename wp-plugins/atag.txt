That?s where ATag comes in.<\/p>\n<p>ATag automatically adds tags to your post by taking the text of your post, removing the 500 (or so) most common words then it tags the post with the most frequency used of the remaining words.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Options<\/p>\n<p>ATag has two options (found in the settings admin menu) the maximum number of tags per post and the option to override existing tags.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Maximum number of tags per post.<\/p>\n<p>This text box allows you to specify the number of tags generated every time the text is analysed.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Override existing tags.<\/p>\n<p>This gives you the option to remove any tags that exist for the post before updating it with the new tags. If you set this option to &#8220;No&#8221; it will add a new set of tags based on the content of the post to any existing tags (including throes generated by ATag) when the page is updated, this may give you more tags then the above maximum number of tags per post, however it lets you add additional tags directly to the post. Setting this option to &#8220;Yes&#8221; deletes any existing tags including any tags specified by the posts author.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Limitations.<\/p>\n<p>While the number of common word is quite high (just over 500 or about 60% of written words) it may not pick up all common words, also it may give some false positives, removing words that, while common, are relevant tags for your blog. If you find this happening often you can edit the excluded list (either adding or removing to the list of common words that are ignored), by editing the ATag. php file (WARNING &#8211; it&#8217;s easy to edit the wrong thing and screw-up the plugin, so only do this if your happy reading php or you have a undamaged copy of the pluging to hand that you can swap in as needed)<\/p>\n<p>if you wish to edit ATag.php, the list starts at about line 100 and ends at line 160, it is also contained within two comment the first says &#8220;Start of common word list&#8221; and (unsurprisingly) the end one says &#8220;End of common word list&#8221;.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Saying thank you<\/p>\n<p>If you find this plugin useful there are a number of ways you can say thank you to me, firstly if you know me in real life, buy me a pint (dark real ale please). Since most of you won&#8217;t know me, there are a number of other things you can do, you can.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Tell people about it &#8211; yep as you run a blog tell people about this plugin (a link to http:\/\/scott-herbert.com\/blog\/ would be nice as well)<\/li>\n<li>Buy me something from my wish list &#8211; it&#8217;s at http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/registry\/wishlist\/2ER3EQGGIMXBU<\/li>\n<li>Donate some money &#8211; however much you think this is worth &#8211; if you?re a company and you need an invoice e-mail me at scott.a.herbert@googlemail.com and I can produce one for you just let me know how much you want to pay and where I should send it (Oh and who I should address it to).
