Between LearnDash &amp; Buddy Boss Platform it is horrible.There are very few effective customer support representatives available. I have struggled with their products for over a year. It is saddening how terrible it is that the education system in America did not make great efforts to teach everyone coding to prepare for the disastrous monopoly on software. Software and applications like the ones released by LearnDash and Buddy Boss Platform are really good for people who have a lot of money and developers on call. But for the majority of us independent creators who they mostly market &amp; sell to, the software is so bad that it could completely derail great projects by exhausting and discouraging well intentioned creators. I absolutely do not recommend their products in its current state. If you could afford it, go ahead and release your courses on a platform like thinkific or whatever. The owners don't give af about us. Course migration is a complete disaster that will rob you of months of energy and time. It does not migrate well and you will find yourself unable to get simple answers no matter how precisely you offer them. Buddy Boss is exactly the same - they promise a smooth migration but you end up going through hell with overrides or messiness from both sides. If you're lucky they'll keep bouncing you back and forth between the 2 companies for support - because they'll blame the conflicts on the other software. Ridiculous. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Works - sort of<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"2 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"2\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/larrydcook\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8e41715ffcbf5cc8b892516814be1665?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8e41715ffcbf5cc8b892516814be1665?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/larrydcook\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">larrydcook<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">June 23, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I hate to be the first one to post a bad review but here we are. So, the plugin did move an entire course over, including the lessons, BUT, the lessons were not nested into the course and there is literally no way to get those lessons into the course. Which means I need to manually add each and every lesson and delete the orphaned lessons. \n\nI tried to move a second course over and nothing happened.\n\nThis is unfortunate - it could have saved me a ton of time if this had worked.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/course-migration-for-learndash.1.0.2.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/course-migration-for-learndash\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2112544","caption":"This is the screen used to transfer courses"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/course-migration-for-learndash\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2112544","caption":"This is the screen of the whitelisted domain used to allow hosts to access the site to put data into the site."}},"tags":{"e-learning":"e-learning","education":"education","elearning":"elearning","learndash":"learndash","lms":"lms"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/course-migration-for-learndash.1.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/course-migration-for-learndash.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/course-migration-for-learndash.1.0.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/course-migration-for-learndash.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
