For instance, to create remixes or mash-ups, video artists need access to the original materials in order to reformulate their new work. In an ideal world, everyday users will be able to easily copy and paste portions of video, as they already can with text. Of course the benefits of a more open system will go far beyond remixing, cutting, and pasting ? when open video standards and formats are widely embraced, it will be possible to index, search, and access the medium much as we do text. This will be the real revolution for video.<\/p>\n<p>Kaltura is a founding member of the Open Video Alliance, a group of organizations, developers, creators, and academics all striving to foster the open-source online video revolution.  We invite the entire community to join us in building the first open-source platform for interactive and collaborative video. We look forward to your input, feedback, time, and support.<\/p>\n<p>Join the community and help us Open Source Video &#8211; http:\/\/community.kaltura.org<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Important notice &#8211; Kaltura will not be releasing any new versions of the Interactive Video Plugin, but don&#8217;t worry, you can download the new and improved Kaltura All in One Video Pack for WordPress &#8211; https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/all-in-one-video-pack\/<\/p>\n<p>Migrating to the new plugin &#8211; it is VERY EASY to upgrade to the All in One Video Pack and still keep all of your existing content and video posts.<br \/>\nHere is what you need to do:<br \/>\n&#8211; Download and install the &#8220;All in One Video Pack&#8221; plugin https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/all-in-one-video-pack\/<br \/>\n&#8211; Deactivate the &#8220;Interactive Video&#8221; plugin (they cannot both be active at the same time)<br \/>\n&#8211; Activating the new plugin will automatically assign it to your Kaltura Partner ID (no additional signup required) and your content will be displayed in the wp-admin panel.<\/p>\n","faq":"<p>What about old players?<br \/>\nThey will continue to function.
