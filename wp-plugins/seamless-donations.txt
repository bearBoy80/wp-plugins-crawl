This gives you the ability to use all of WordPress\u2019 post management and display tools with donors and funds. The donation data has always been a custom post type, but it is now also available to manipulate using<br \/>\nplugins and themes outside of Seamless Donations.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Designed for extensibility:<\/strong> The primary design goal of 4.0 was to add hooks in the form of filters and actions that web designers can use to modify the behavior of Seamless Donations to fit individual needs. The plugin was re-architected to allow for loads of extensibility.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Forms engine designed for extensibility:<\/strong> Rather than just basic form code, Seamless Donations 4.0 now has a brand-new array-driven forms engine, which will give web site builders the ability to modify and access every part of the form before it is displayed to donors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Shortcode engine designed for extensibility:<\/strong> The main shortcode for the plugin has been designed so that extensions can add features to the main seamless-donations shortcode.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Admin UI designed for extensibility:<\/strong> Yep, like everything else, the admin interface has been designed to allow for extensibility.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Translation-ready:<\/strong> Seamless Donations 4.0 has had numerous tweaks to allow it to be translated into other languages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Open Source, Extensible, and Developer-Friendly<\/h4>\n<p>Seamless Donations was designed from the ground up to be developer-friendly.

easier<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First public repository release of major 5.0 admin UI rebuild (5.0.0, 5.0.1, and 5.0.2 were beta releases only)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new action seamless_donations_tab_settings_before_payments which runs just before seamless_donations_tab_settings_before_paypal.<br \/>\nThese two

This is now formatted in adminstyles.css<\/li>\n<li>Changed how admin validation filters are called. Before, the filter took three parameters. Now, it&#8217;s only passed one, the $<em>POST. You can process admin form validations for any button pressed in the Seamless Donations admin UI. The filter is validate_page_slug<\/em>[page_slug_name]. For example, if a page\u2019s slug is seamless_donations_tab_thanks, it calls the filter validate_page_slug_seamless_donations_tab_thanks.<\/li>\n<li>Changed the naming convention for all admin callbacks. Prior to 5.0, admin pages were previously of the form seamless_donations_admin_[name] and, as of 5.0, are now of the form seamless_donations_tab_[name]. Therefore any callback that would have used the slug seamless_donations_admin_[name] must now use the slug seamless_donations_tab_[name].<\/li>\n<li>Fixed issue in Basic Widget Pack where a crash was caused when deactivating Seamless Donations itself.

E.g. returning from the Stripe page after canceling the donation messes up the \"donation was canceled\" page.\n\nCSS customization is also a pain in the a** due to lack of properly classed HTML elements. Lots of jQuery tricks needed to get this done. Why are the developers using the same identifier for multiple HTML elements? Seems like lack of understanding...\n\nThe de_DE translation (at least) is only halfway done. Tried Loco Translate to fix it but many phrases didn't show up there. Touching the plugin's source code or using JS to replace the texts isn't update-safe.\n\nI've dropped this plugin.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Awesome plugin!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/joe777\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f2aa5c143c1b6cef85faf860999b2c2e?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f2aa5c143c1b6cef85faf860999b2c2e?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/joe777\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Joe777<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 28, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I'm very happy with the Seamless Donations plugin.

Once installing and activating, you just type [seamless-donations] shortcode on a blank page and you immediately have a default donations form. There are many custom options available as well. \n\nThe developer has provided a handful of useful add-ons that are the most reasonably priced in the industry.\n\nI ran into some unexpected challenges in setting up my Stripe account. The developer worked tirelessly with me to figure out what was wrong with my system since he had never seen the problem before. He ultimately checked out my installation and voila!!! It worked.\n\nI cannot say enough about this plugin. Have you checked out the competition? I think we need donations to pay for them. Seamless Donations ensures that even the smallest non-profits can afford to set up a donations page. Churches and clubs now have a way to collect funds and donations very easily.\nI love the funds feature. Donors can donate to a variety of funds set up by the organisation. There is a backend report that shows the total donations received for each fund. \n\nThank you very much and I hope everyone buys EVERY add-on you have for sale and I wish you all the best.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great Plugin with Outstanding Support<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/wceven\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ec3466d4a09da582198bccad78a532a2?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ec3466d4a09da582198bccad78a532a2?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/wceven\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">wceven<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 6, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I have installed this plugin on four or five of my sites and have purchased the Giving Level Manager upgrade for a few of them. \n\nI ran into an issue in one installation that required me to contact David for some assistance.
