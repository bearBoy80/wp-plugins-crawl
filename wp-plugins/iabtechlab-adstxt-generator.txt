Ads.txt enables content owners to specify which advertising systems and resellers are authorized to sell their inventory. Ads.txt is designed to increase transparency within the programmatic world and decrease fraudulent activity.<\/p>\n<p>As of now, DoubleClick Bid Manager (DBM) will stop buying traffic on all domains via third parties (i.e. SSP), unless they are declared as an authorized reseller through one&#8217;s ads.txt &#8211; this could negatively impact your revenues. That said, these next two months are imperative and we would hate for you to miss out on any revenue opportunities during Q4!<\/p>\n<p>The mission of the ads.txt project is simple: Increase transparency in the programmatic advertising ecosystem. Ads.txt stands for Authorized Digital Sellers and is a simple, flexible and secure method that publishers and distributors can use to publicly declare the companies they authorize to sell their digital inventory.<\/p>\n<p>By creating a public record of Authorized Digital Sellers, ads.txt will create greater transparency in the inventory supply chain, and give publishers control over their inventory in the market, making it harder for bad actors to profit from selling counterfeit inventory across the ecosystem. As publishers adopt ads.txt, buyers will be able to more easily identify the Authorized Digital Sellers for a participating publisher, allowing brands to have confidence they are buying authentic publisher inventory.<\/p>\n<p>Read More <a href=\"https:\/\/iabtechlab.com\/ads-txt-about\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"> Click Here <\/a><\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>iabtechlab-adstxt-generator<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Use the Settings-&gt;Plugin-Name screen to configure the plugin<\/li>\n<li>Insert the data as per need<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Installation Instructions<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>iabtechlab-adstxt-generator<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Use the Settings-&gt;Plugin-Name screen to configure the plugin<\/li>\n<li>Insert the data as per need<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is the service paid?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, Its Free. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<p>None<\/p>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Awesome Plugin<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/shreyansh007\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/abadd03bb58dbd971cdba2e5782ff9b9?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/abadd03bb58dbd971cdba2e5782ff9b9?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/shreyansh007\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">shreyansh007<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 10, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Easy to use and handle the very important ads.txt file on your wordpress\n\nThanks To vBidManager. \nCheers<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/iabtechlab-adstxt-generator.2.0.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"ads-txt":"ads.txt","ads-txt-generator":"ads.txt generator","adstxt":"adstxt"},"versions":{"2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/iabtechlab-adstxt-generator.2.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/iabtechlab-adstxt-generator.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
