That would save weeks of typing... \n\nThe other item on my \"wish list\" is a \"Tree\" graphic - currently the only over-view seems to consist of an HTML \"sitemap\" that lists all Members... A graphical view of that would be awesome... \n\nKind regards\nBen <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/genealogy.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/genealogy\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1539068","caption":"The screen for adding family members"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/genealogy\/trunk\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1539068","caption":"The Genealogy plugin settings page"}},"tags":{"family":"family","family-history":"family history","family-tree":"family tree","genealogy":"genealogy","pedigree":"pedigree"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/genealogy.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/genealogy.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/genealogy.1.2.zip","1.2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/genealogy.1.2.1.zip","1.2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/genealogy.1.2.2.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/suiteplugins.com\/donate\/","banners":[]}
