Set which post types, how many results, and customize the display format of the results. Lots of unique CSS classes included for full custom styling!<\/p>\n<p>This plugin was created as a way to help customers find documentation articles before submitting a support ticket. The goal is to reduce the number of support tickets submitted by helping customers find and answer themselves.

Thank you very much.\n\nSuggested fix:\nI'm using v0.2.\nWhen you add a one-line text field in the management screen, the same field option as the search field, that is, \"Select Custom Post Type (s)\" is displayed. Searching in the front end of a one-line text field doesn't work, so I think it's better to remove this option.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/search-field-for-gravity-forms.1.1.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/search-field-for-gravity-forms\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2515892","caption":"Field settings"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/search-field-for-gravity-forms\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2515892","caption":"Sample form with search field showing results"}},"tags":{"gravity-forms":"gravity forms","gravityforms":"GravityForms","search":"search"},"versions":{"0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/search-field-for-gravity-forms.0.2.zip","0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/search-field-for-gravity-forms.0.3.zip","0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/search-field-for-gravity-forms.0.4.zip","0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/search-field-for-gravity-forms.0.5.zip","0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/search-field-for-gravity-forms.0.6.zip","0.6.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/search-field-for-gravity-forms.0.6.1.zip","0.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/search-field-for-gravity-forms.0.7.zip","0.7.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/search-field-for-gravity-forms.0.7.1.zip","1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/search-field-for-gravity-forms.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/search-field-for-gravity-forms.1.1.zip","1.1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/search-field-for-gravity-forms.1.1.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/search-field-for-gravity-forms.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/search-field-for-gravity-forms\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2677287","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/search-field-for-gravity-forms\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2677287"}}
