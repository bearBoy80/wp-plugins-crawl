If it has, it means that Interakt did try to send the notification, but for some reason, it failed to get sent. Click on \u2018View Details\u2019 in the \u2018Failed\u2019 box to check the reason for failure. One common reason for failure could that &#8211; If the image of the product (for which the notification is being attempted) is stored in your WordPress admin in WebP format, the notification will fail since WhatsApp only allows sending JPeG or PnG format images in templates.Hence, you can try changing the images in WordPress\/Woocommerce to JPeg \/ Png format. Or, you could create a new template in Interakt, which doesn\u2019t contain the image. Then pause the existing campaign, duplicate it and change the template in the campaign to the new one.<\/li>\n<li>If you find that notifications are not even getting attempted, then you need to check if the plugin is sending \u2018events\u2019 into your Interakt account. To test this,<\/li>\n<li>Place a CoD order in your website.<\/li>\n<li>Then go to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.interakt.ai\/contacts\/list\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/app.interakt.ai\/contacts\/list<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Click on \u2018Add Filter\u2019 &amp; search for \u2018order cod\u2019<\/li>\n<li>Click on \u2018Created On\u2019 \u2192 \u2018has any value\u2019 \u2192 Done.<\/li>\n<li>Check if the name which you used in the CoD order appears in the list or not.<\/li>\n<li>If it appears, it implies that events are being sent by the plugin.

However, the Interakt plugin will detect this order &amp; send an \u2018Abandoned checkout\u2019 event into your Interakt account.<br \/>\n* The customer abandoned the checkout after starting payment  &#8211; in this case, the order appears in the orders panel in your Woocommerce admin. The default order status is \u2018Pending Payment\u2019. In Step 2 of the \u2018integration steps\u2019 given here, if you have mapped \u2018Pending Payment\u2019 against Abandoned Checkout, in that case, the plugin will send the \u2018Abandoned checkout\u2019 event into your Interakt account.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that the plugin waits for 15 minutes before sending the event into your Interakt account in both the above cases. After 15 minutes it checks whether the order was placed or not &#8211; if not, then it sends the event.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, to sum up, the logic for sending Abandoned Checkout notifications is as follows:<\/p>\n<p>Within 15 minutes of the customer filling the phone number, if the order does not appear in your Woocommerce orders panel, OR, it does appear in the order panel, but with statuses like Pending Payment \/ Failed, then the checkout will be considered as abandoned and an \u2018Abandoned checkout\u2019 event will be sent into your Interakt account.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20publish%20a%20whatsapp%20widget%20on%20my%20wordpress%20website%20via%20interakt%3F'>\nHow can I publish a WhatsApp Widget on my WordPress website via Interakt?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Steps:<br \/>\n* Go to <a href=\"https:\/\/appdev.interakt.ai\/widget\/manage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/appdev.interakt.ai\/widget\/manage<\/a><br \/>\n* Design your WhatsApp Widget<br \/>\n* Click on Save Changes<br \/>\n* Go to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.interakt.ai\/widget\/install\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/app.interakt.ai\/widget\/install<\/a><br \/>\n* Copy the HTML \/ Javascript code<br \/>\n* Paste it in your website\u2019s code<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20create%20a%20whatsapp%20catalog%20with%20my%20woocommerce%20products%20%26%20send%20it%20to%201000s%20of%20customers%3F'>\nHow can I create a WhatsApp Catalog with my Woocommerce Products &amp; send it to 1000s of customers?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Steps:<br \/>\n* Go to Products in your WordPress Admin and export all products into a CSV file.<br \/>\n* Map the different product fields to the fields given in this <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1pLPQwE755LxumObAW0W9NBCS1hDZiUVfQ2yr_k40c_o\/edit#gid=1925743516\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">sheet<\/a>.
