It lets the wordpress site owners see which posts or pages have a featured image set.<\/p>\n<p>Choose between three thumbnail sizes.<br \/>\nSort the Post List by Featured Image<br \/>\nFilter the Post List by Has\/Does Not Have Featured Image<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is mainly intended for use on the Post List page, since most themes require a featured image be set for the excerpt thumbnail image. It doesn&#8217;t seem like much, and the plugin is truly non-invasive to the rest for the WP install. But the value that this simple tool can have on the overall organization for Admins and Developers of WordPress websites is priceless.<\/p>\n<p>By enhancing the plugin with the Pro Addon, you can easily change, add, or remove images with the <strong>Quick Edit<\/strong> feature, directly from your Posts List Page, which now includes standard Post Editor Media Library selection. Pro also now supports <strong>Custom Post Type<\/strong> lists.<\/p>\n<h3>Instructions and Usage<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thumbnail Size<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Choose between 50px, 100px and 150px<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sorting by Featured Image<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>On the Post\/Page list pages of the Admin area, click on the Featured Image column heading to sort by Featured Image ID.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Filtering by Featured Image<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>On the Post\/Page list pages of the Admin area, Choose to Filter the posts by &#8220;Show All Posts with Featured Image&#8221; or &#8220;Show All Posts without Featured Image&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is especially helpful for assigning new featured image to posts that do not have them.
