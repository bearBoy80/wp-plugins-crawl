Your traffic is divided between A and B, and their conversion rate is measured.<\/p>\n<p>An A\/B testing tool like Convertize manages both pages, helps you edit page B, and keeps a record of your visitors\u2019 behaviour. It allows you to increase your conversions, get more sales and sign-ups and reduce your bounce rate.<\/p>\n<p>Because you gather real data about how visitors interact with your content, you can systematically optimize your website page by page. Convertize makes WordPress A\/B testing easier (and faster) than other tools, which is why it is a popular VWO alternative and a great alternative to AB Tasty or Optimizely.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nIs Installation Difficult?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Installation is very easy.<\/p>\n<p>To start A\/B testing your WordPress website, first add the Convertize plugin. Then, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.convertize.io\/auth\/login\/register?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=plugin-listing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">register for a Convertize account<\/a>. Once you have registered, you will receive the code needed to activate your Convertize plugin.<\/p>\n<p>With the Plugin activated, you are able to edit pages, run tests and install notifications immediately.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nHow Do I Track The Results?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Convertize will track every visit to your site, sending some visitors to page A and some to page B. The number directed to each version will change depending on which page performs best. That way, you never waste any of your traffic.<\/p>\n<p>The results page shows you which page converted best for every day that your A\/B test is running.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nWhat if I make a Mistake?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry! Convertize includes an in-built checklist to make sure your test works. It has a number of additional safety features. Because the system responds immediately to your visitors\u2019 behaviour, the best-performing page receives the majority of your traffic. Even if your test scenario is less popular than the original page, you won\u2019t lose out on conversions.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/convertize\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2322287\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/convertize\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2322287\" alt=\"SmartEditor\u2122\"><\/a><p>SmartEditor\u2122<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/convertize\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2322287\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/convertize\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2322287\" alt=\"Dashboard\"><\/a><p>Dashboard<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/convertize\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2322287\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/convertize\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2322287\" alt=\"Experiment results\"><\/a><p>Experiment results<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Easy to use AB Testing Tool<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/phaime\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c9e7c29b1a577d183c20429e9a4dd6c5?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c9e7c29b1a577d183c20429e9a4dd6c5?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/phaime\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">phaime<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 6, 2019<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Easy to use AB Testing Tool, simple ingterface, good automation features<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/convertize.1.0.6.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/convertize\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2322287","caption":"SmartEditor\u2122"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/convertize\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2322287","caption":"Dashboard"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/convertize\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2322287","caption":"Experiment results"}},"tags":{"convertize":"Convertize","getscenario":"getScenario","pixel":"pixel","scenario":"scenario","tracking":"tracking"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/convertize.1.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/convertize.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/convertize.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/convertize.1.0.3.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/convertize.1.0.4.zip","1.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/convertize.1.0.5.zip","1.0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/convertize.1.0.6.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/convertize.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/convertize\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2324544","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/convertize\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2324544"}}
