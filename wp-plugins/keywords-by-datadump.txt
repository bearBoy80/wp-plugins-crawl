The goal is to produce 6-7 short keyphrases (of one or two, or possibly three keywords each) and include them in a keywords meta tag in the document header. These keyphrases should be representative of the document&#8217;s focus and content. N-gram (max n=2) analysis is used on the page content after stopword removal to build the keyword list. Dirty and simple, just the way I like it!<\/p>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/keywords-by-datadump.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":[],"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
