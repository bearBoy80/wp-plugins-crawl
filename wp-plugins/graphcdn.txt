We re-published our WordPress plugin under our new name: <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/stellate\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Stellate<\/a>. This plugin will continue to exist but won&#8217;t receive any further updates, please switch to the new plugin.<\/p>\n<h3>GraphCDN plugin for WordPress<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin is an addon for the popular <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/wp-graphql\/wp-graphql\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPGraphQL<\/a> plugin. It helps with setting up <a href=\"https:\/\/graphcdn.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GraphCDN<\/a> in front of a WordPress GraphQL API by automatically taking care of invalidating the cache when content is updated in WordPress. If works no matter the source of the update (WordPress admin panel, GraphQL mutation, REST API, etc.). It also supports custom post types and custom taxonomies that are exposed over the GraphQL API.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin only works when you already have the WPGraphQL plugin installed. After adding this plugin you&#8217;ll see a new menu item named &#8220;Caching&#8221; in the &#8220;GraphQL&#8221; section of the dashboard sidebar. Here you can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the name of your GraphCDN service and a purging token (without that the plugin will effectively do nothing).<\/li>\n<li>Toggle between soft and hard purging. (Soft purging means that the cache will continue serving stale data even after the purge while the data is revalidated in the background.)<\/li>\n<li>Purge the entire GraphCDN cache right from the WordPress dashboard.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more information check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.graphcdn.io\/docs\/graphcdn-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">The service is great!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/bbioon\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/72492ff0819e9f3f3c6ecda151206c73?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/72492ff0819e9f3f3c6ecda151206c73?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/bbioon\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Ahmad Wael <small>(bbioon)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 22, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">We have used this service to cache our GraphQL requests, and it does a great job saving our CPU power and bandwidth.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/graphcdn.0.1.1.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"api":"api","caching":"caching","graphcdn":"GraphCDN","graphql":"GraphQL","wpgraphql":"WpGraphQL"},"versions":{"0.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/graphcdn.0.1.0.zip","0.1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/graphcdn.0.1.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/graphcdn.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/graphcdn\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2721820","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/graphcdn\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2721820"}}
