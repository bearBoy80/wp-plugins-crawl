Current themes give you some areas to publish the widgets, but those areas are static because they show later on the same content in all posts and pages within the template.<br \/>\nRDWS allows you to create as many widget areas as you need. By this you can create your own custom sidebars, adding widgets and manage the place in which pages or post they should take place. Further more you can manage the style by setting your own CSS values over a GUI. With RDWS you can create complex websites, with height relevant content, without writing a single line of code.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.jb-webs.com\/dynamic-wordpress-sidebar\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Check Out the Pro Version for more features<\/a><\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/vZ1uwhCo4rE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<h4>Existing features of premium Version include:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to use and sophisticated backend, it will take you less than a minute to make it work.<\/li>\n<li>Add as many Sidebars as you want<\/li>\n<li>Manage Connection Globally or Locally<\/li>\n<li>Manage Position Top \/ Right \/ Bottom \/ Left side of the page.<\/li>\n<li>It is scaleable, you can add as many Sidebars as you like, even within the same page. <\/li>\n<li>Manage CSS by using build in CSS Style Editor<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Advanced Extruder Concept  &#8211; Easy to use<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Extruder concept allows complete new concepts what you publish in your Sidebar. <\/li>\n<li>By this you can publish complete pages, pricing tables, shopping cards, pricelist or what ever, what is very helpful to help page vistors tograb your message faster.<\/li>\n<li>Has a heighly scalable Page connection system, to connect sidebars Global (all Pages and \/ or Posts) or locally to a particular page or Post &#8211; no coding needed. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>REAL-Dynamic-Wordpress -Sidebar is available in:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>English<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<p>The plugin is simple to install:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download <code>REAL-Dynamic-Wordpress -Sidebar.zip<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Unzip<\/li>\n<li>Upload <code>REAL-Dynamic-Wordpress -Sidebar<\/code> directory to your <code>\/wp-content\/plugins<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Go to the plugin management page and enable the plugin<\/li>\n<li>Configure the options from the <code>\/wp-admin\/admin.php?page=REAL-Wordpress-Sidebar-Pro\/includes\/admin.php<\/code> page<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You can find full details http:\/\/www.jb-webs.com\/dynamic-wordpress-sidebar\/<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/drag-and-drop-custom-sidebar\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=796602\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/drag-and-drop-custom-sidebar\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=796602\" alt=\"Common Problem -
