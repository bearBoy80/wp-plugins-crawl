Your uploads are secured in a special folder. The secure download links are created by shortcodes which you can use anywhere. Every shortcode call generates a new download link so be cautious where to use it (best suited within automatic emails).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create temporary download links for any file <\/li>\n<li>Automatically expire download links after a time limit limit <\/li>\n<li>Know how many times the file has been downloaded.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>First upload your files to a secured folder. Then generate expiring links to your protected uploads. Usage with wp shortcodes.<\/p>\n<p>Caution: Files are protected via .htaccess.
