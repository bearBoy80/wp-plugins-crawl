Comply with rules and regulations, prevent data leaks.<\/p>\n<p>WordPress databases are often copied from production to test and development environments. This leads to a representative dataset for development and testing.<br \/>\nHowever, most production databases contain Personal Identifiable Information, so you need to have effective security controls in place to comply with rules and regulations such as EU GDPR.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin contributes to compliancy and supports data leak prevention originating from non-production installations, while retaining the WordPress database structure and integrity.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It transforms PII to anonymous data using customizable rules, with each rule creating a step of the data transformation.<\/li>\n<li>By retaining the data structure (in most cases), the anonymization will usually not break functionality and keep the data set sufficiently representative.<\/li>\n<li>You can anonymize many data types using a wide range of transformations (listed below). <\/li>\n<li>It comes with a built-in ruleset for default WordPress installs to get you off the ground.<\/li>\n<li>You can add, change and delete rules to make the anonymization work as you see fit. <\/li>\n<li>It provides powerful options to anonymize any column in any WordPress database table, supporting all plugins that use the database to store personal data.<\/li>\n<li>It can target specific PII hidden in meta database tables such as WP options.<\/li>\n<li>It can handle serialized data stored in database records.<\/li>\n<li>It can handle JSON data stored in database records.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can create rules to skip specific records that contain PII of admins, developers and testers. This prevents locking yourself out of WordPress and ensures that you and test users can perform their tasks while personal data from customers and other users is anonymized.<\/p>\n<p>Optionally you can create a temporary back-up, so you can inspect the transformation results before finalizing the anonymization.<\/p>\n<p>You will find this plugin in the Tools menu of WordPress.<\/p>\n<h4>Supported data types<\/h4>\n<p>All types of personal data are supported with all-purpose transformations.<\/p>\n<p>There are special transformations for the following data types:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>email address   <\/li>\n<li>person name<\/li>\n<li>nickname<\/li>\n<li>nicename (WordPress specific data type)<\/li>\n<li>phone number<\/li>\n<li>age<\/li>\n<li>birthdate<\/li>\n<li>IBAN<\/li>\n<li>street address<\/li>\n<li>city<\/li>\n<li>URL<\/li>\n<li>IP address<\/li>\n<li>HTTP agent<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>All-purpose transformations<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One string<\/strong><br \/>\nFills a table column with a character string as defined by you, the same for all records.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Empty<\/strong><br \/>\nFills a table column with empty values for all records.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Random characters<\/strong><br \/>\nFills a table column with different random characters per record.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Random digits<\/strong><br \/>\nFills a table column with different random digits per record.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Random pattern<\/strong><br \/>\nFills a table column with different random digits or characters per record according to a pattern.

The plugin processes this structure by applying a filter to create a subset of records.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s explain by giving a example.<\/p>\n<p>In the WP usermeta table, the meaning of the record is defined by the contents of the column meta_key.<br \/>\nE.g. meta_key = <code>first_name<\/code>. The contents of the column meta_value for this record will be interpreted as being the first name of a person.<\/p>\n<p>Another record may have a different value for meta_key.<br \/>\nE.g. meta_key = <code>locale<\/code> and meta_value = <code>en_US<\/code> must be interpreted as the user preference for US English.<\/p>\n<p>So if you want to anonymize all first names in the WP usermeta table, you can apply a filter to only transform records with meta_key = <code>first_name<\/code>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20the%20predefined%20lists%20originate%20from%3F'>\nWhere do the predefined lists originate from?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most lists originate from <a href=\"https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Chat GPT<\/a>, inspired by a US and European perspective.<br \/>\nThe non-existing IBANs originate from <a href=\"http:\/\/randomiban.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Random Iban Generator<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20list%20entries%3F'>\nCan I change the list entries?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>In this free edition it is not possible to customize the lists.
