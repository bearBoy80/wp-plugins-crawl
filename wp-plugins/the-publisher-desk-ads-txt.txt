Because the administration of a file outside the wordpress directory can pose challenges depending on the WP\/Server configuration, the plugin decides on installation whether to use an actual ads.txt file in the root of the domain, or a quasi-ads.txt file built through a WP option and responding to a server request for &#8220;\/ads.txt&#8221; by providing the contents of that option (containing both custom lines and those associated with TPD&#8217;s centralalized list).<\/p>\n<p>Troubleshooting an installation:<br \/>\nIf you already have an ads.txt file present on your site, the plugin will rename it to ads-txt-original.txt on installation, and re-rename that file back on de-installation. If your site&#8217;s wordpress instance doesn&#8217;t have access to files outside of its installation directory and you already have an ads.txt file, the plugin won&#8217;t be able to dislodge the existing file and allow the management of the one it creates. You can check whether this has happened if you check your site&#8217;s ads.txt file directly (site.com\/ads.txt) and there&#8217;s no line reading:<br \/>\n    &#8220;### END TPD ADS TXT ###&#8221;<br \/>\na line that is used by the plugin to demarcate custom entries and The Publisher Desk&#8217;s. If this is the case, please deactivate the plugin, rename or remove your existing file, re-activate, and check the file again (you might have to refresh several times depending on caching). If you still don&#8217;t see that line and the file looks the same as before the update, please reach out to TPD for assistance.<\/p>\n<p>Final Note: it&#8217;s good practice to have a backup of your custom ads.txt lines. We have functionality for retaining your custom lines on plugin updates\/re-installs, but it&#8217;s good to make sure since it can be a big pain to recollect entries if you lose them.<\/p>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Solid!!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/henzlym\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/09a586e587dee790f56072d5ef6f76d7?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/09a586e587dee790f56072d5ef6f76d7?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/henzlym\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Henzly Meghie <small>(henzlym)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">June 13, 2019<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This plugin does what it's supposed to simple and easy!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/the-publisher-desk-ads-txt.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"ads":"ads","ads-txt":"ads.txt","advertising":"advertising","monetization":"monetization","publishing":"publishing"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/the-publisher-desk-ads-txt.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/the-publisher-desk-ads-txt.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/the-publisher-desk-ads-txt.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/the-publisher-desk-ads-txt.1.3.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/the-publisher-desk-ads-txt.1.4.zip","1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/the-publisher-desk-ads-txt.1.5.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
