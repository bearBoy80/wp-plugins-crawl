It would be better if you take some time to properly go through your documentation from your user perspective. Please don't assume every user that downloaded will subscribe to the PRO version. Your video explanation is all about Pro Feature, luring me to download the plugin, and only realize I was wasting my time. Overall, good plugin, but weak documentation. I found some broken links in your documentation, please fix that too. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/accordion-faq-for-elementor.1.4.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/accordion-faq-for-elementor\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2470996","caption":""},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/accordion-faq-for-elementor\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2470996","caption":""},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/accordion-faq-for-elementor\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=2470996","caption":""},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/accordion-faq-for-elementor\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=2470996","caption":""}},"tags":{"accordion-faq":"accordion faq","faq":"faq","faq-for-elementor":"FAQ for elementor","faq-with-category":"faq with category","knowledge-based-faq":"knowledge based faq"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/accordion-faq-for-elementor.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/accordion-faq-for-elementor.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/accordion-faq-for-elementor.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/accordion-faq-for-elementor.1.3.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/accordion-faq-for-elementor.1.4.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/accordion-faq-for-elementor.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/accordion-faq-for-elementor\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2470997","high":false}}
