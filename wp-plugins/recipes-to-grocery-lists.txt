When a person clicks to view the grocery list, it will open up a new window on the Say Mmm website, where our technology will do the work for you of displaying an organized grocery list that people can edit, combine with other lists, and print out. Please note this only works once your recipe post has been published.<\/p>\n<p>**Organized grocery lists** \u2013 Say Mmm will use the ingredients on your recipe post to create a grocery list that is organized by area of the store with common pantry items like \u201csalt\u201d separated out at the bottom. It will also change things you use to cook, like \u201c1 cup of shredded carrots\u201d into items you\u2019d buy in the store, like 2 carrots.<\/p>\n<p>**Nutritional estimates** \u2013 Based on the amounts and items found, readers can view a nutritional estimate and see a graphical breakout of the top things that affect nutritional values like calories, fat, and cholesterol. \u00a0If you have the servings listed for the recipe, it will show the estimates per serving.<\/p>\n<p>**Combining lists** \u2013 Your readers can even combine lists from multiple recipes into one organized list and even add, edit, and delete items, all without even needing a Say Mmm account.<\/p>\n<p>For more info, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.SayMmm.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http:\/\/www.SayMmm.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Get Recipes to Grocery Lists using through the WordPress plugin installer, and then click to Activate.
