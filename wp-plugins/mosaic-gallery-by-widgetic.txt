There are 4 layouts to choose from: mosaic, grid, list, and masonry.<\/p>\n<p>This makes it perfect for either showcasing your products or using the gallery as navigation. We think great images are better in the right context. Because of these unique layouts, your photos are telling a story together.<\/p>\n<p>By clicking on each image you can send users to a specific page or show more information in fullscreen mode. This lightbox view makes it easy to explore richer details in every photo. You can even use different images for the thumbnails and the previews.<\/p>\n<h4>Effortless galleries<\/h4>\n<p>Showcase your products or services in a dynamic layout created on spot.<\/p>\n<h4>Large previews<\/h4>\n<p>Enable visitors to see all details of a product by enlarging images in a lightbox preview.<\/p>\n<h4>Use photos as navigation<\/h4>\n<p>Display your images as navigation with independent Call-To-Action links and titles.<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mosaic-gallery-by-widgetic\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2719570\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mosaic-gallery-by-widgetic\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2719570\" alt=\"The block as a grid.\"><\/a><p>The block as a grid.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mosaic-gallery-by-widgetic\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2719570\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mosaic-gallery-by-widgetic\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2719570\" alt=\"The block as a list.\"><\/a><p>The block as a list.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mosaic-gallery-by-widgetic\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2719570\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/mosaic-gallery-by-widgetic\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2719570\" alt=\"Fullscreen preview.\"><\/a><p>Fullscreen preview.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Nope<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jimmerd\/\"><img alt='' src='http:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/avatar\/4ec0b8ca827b17a2f8ea9d28455626e5?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='http:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/avatar\/4ec0b8ca827b17a2f8ea9d28455626e5?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jimmerd\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">jimmerd<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">January 16, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I tried this one out to see if it'd be a good fit.
