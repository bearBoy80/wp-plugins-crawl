With this plugin you&#8217;ll have manual control of reducing item stock straight from the order page in the WordPress admin.<\/p>\n<p>Manually reducing the stock for an order is very useful for store owners who include free samples with orders, create manual orders in the admin, or change items for an order in general. The plugin uses WooCommerce functions to reduce stock which ensure that stock is reduced only for items that haven&#8217;t had their stock reduced already.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Be sure you&#8217;re running WooCommerce 4.0.0+ and WordPress 4.4+ in your shop.<\/li>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>manually-reduce-stock-for-woocommerce<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory, or upload the .zip file with the plugin under <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the <strong>Plugins<\/strong> menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/manually-reduce-stock-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2386133\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/manually-reduce-stock-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2386133\" alt=\"The new &quot;Reduce Stock&quot; button, which will immediately reduce the stock of all eligible items within the order and display an order note once the process is complete.\"><\/a><p>The new \"Reduce Stock\" button, which will immediately reduce the stock of all eligible items within the order and display an order note once the process is complete.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Exactly what I needed<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/knutsp\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/419fe61d3c557bcf61322376177b4709?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/419fe61d3c557bcf61322376177b4709?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/knutsp\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Knut Sparhell <small>(knutsp)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 26, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Does exactly is described.
