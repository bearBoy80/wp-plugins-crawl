This works better with my Evernote setup workflow. Otherwise this is the only thing out there I've seen that works to get a note from evernote into a blog post in wordpress. Zapier failes. Can't import images. ITTT failes, because triggers off of all shared links. Co-schedule works, but triggers syndication to from evernote to wordpress from inside Co-Schedule, not evernote. So I hope this plug in gets some love and updating because it's the best and only thing out there that does this!\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sentinote.1.1.4.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sentinote\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=902974","caption":"Sentinote Core Settings"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sentinote\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=902974","caption":"Evernote Extension"}},"tags":{"autoblog":"autoblog","evernote":"evernote","integration":"integration"},"versions":{"1.1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sentinote.1.1.4.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sentinote.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=NMW2QPREEXL48","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sentinote\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=902974","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sentinote\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=902974"}}
