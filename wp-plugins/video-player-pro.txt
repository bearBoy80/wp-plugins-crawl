Consider different qualities for your videos<br \/>\nand add them to the playlists you have created. Provide tags for your videos so that the suggestion system works properly.<br \/>\nOf course, if you do not do this, it will automatically use the video title to suggest the most similar videos to the user.<\/p>\n<p>If I want to introduce you to one of the best tools of this plugin, I will definitely tell you that they are subtitles<br \/>\nbecause you can easily introduce subtitle files (.srt) to your videos in different languages. There may be less language<br \/>\nthat we do not support and you do not have to worry about it.<\/p>\n<p>Why likes and comments? The best tool you can use to get your users&#8217; feedback on the video is likes and comments.<br \/>\nComments are recorded separately from WordPress comments and are provided separately for each video. Keep in mind that<br \/>\nlikes and comments require the user to log in to the site.<\/p>\n<p>Video analysis and control of incoming traffic can be an interesting feature in the plugin.<br \/>\nThe meaning of the number of views is quite clear to us, but what does the incoming traffic mean for each video?<br \/>\nVideos have different modes for viewing:<br \/>\n*   Use widgets and shortcodes on different pages and posts<br \/>\n*   embed videos<br \/>\n*   Cards and end screens<br \/>\n*   Video suggestion<br \/>\nSo videos can have different ways of being viewed, which is controlled by the traffic system and reports their ratio<br \/>\nto each other and the ratio of each video to other videos.<\/p>\n<h4>What do we have Elementor widget and shortcode?<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Player (<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/elementor\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Widget Elementor<\/a>\/Shortcode)<\/li>\n<li>Playlist (<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/elementor\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Widget Elementor<\/a>\/Shortcode)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<h4>WordPress<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to the plugin page<\/li>\n<li>Click Add and then click Upload and select the plugin file<\/li>\n<li>Activate it after uploading and extracting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>FTP Server<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to wp-content \/ plugin<\/li>\n<li>Upload the plugin zip file and extract it<\/li>\n<li>Go to the plugins page in the admin panel and enable the plugin<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20buy%20the%20pro%20version%3F'>\nHow do I buy the pro version?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>To buy the profThe only professional version of <a href=\"http:\/\/idea-land.co\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">idea-land.co<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20request%20support%3F'>\nHow to request support?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Idea land is ready to support your products to solve your plugin problems.

put videos inside the pages with the mentor widget.\nIt is very good and has good features, such as: \n<ul>\n\t<li>Cards that are very present and are displayed to the user at a certain time from the video, the timeline is very good and they can be easily adjusted.<\/li>\n\t<li>End screens are practical and good<\/li>\n\t<li>The system has a cool visit and shows the number of visits<\/li>\n\n<\/ul>\n\nOf course, the plugin also has problems, and I understand that it is normal, and I hope you will develop the plugin more soon.\nGood luck<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/video-player-pro.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/video-player-pro\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2467620","caption":"Home
