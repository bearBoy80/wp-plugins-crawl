They can also click a pray button that lets the original poster know their request has been prayed for by someone else. Each request displays a count of how many times it has been prayed for. All requests can be categorized and tagged like a post.<\/p>\n<p>Authorized users can track and manage prayer requests through admin page. They can approve requests, enter comments as well as look at several other pieces of information stored with each request.<\/p>\n<h4>Live Prayer<\/h4>\n<p>View our working version of Prayer, post a prayer request or pray for others here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goprayer.com\/request-prayer\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Request Prayer<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Requests may be entered by those needing prayer directly through your existing website.

If the maximum number of requests from related IP addresses exceeds a certain time interval, then excessive requests are blocked. Spam bots usually submit the info immediately after the page has been loaded, this happens because spam bots do not actually fill the web form, they just send $_POST data to the blog. The normal visitor sends the data after several seconds or minutes. When the prayer request is posted, if the timestamps are missing or if the user did not spend enough time on the page, the prayer request will be blocked.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20spam%20prevention%20%28aka%20honeypot%20technique%29%20method%20work%3F'>\nHow does spam prevention (aka honeypot technique) method work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The spam prevention is based on fact that almost all the bots will fill inputs with name &#8217;email&#8217; or &#8216;url&#8217;. Extra hidden field is added to prayer request form. This field is hidden for the user and user will not fill it. But this field is visible for the spammer. If the spammer will fill this trap-field with anything &#8211; the prayer request will be blocked because it is spam. This blocks automatic spam messages (sent by spam-bots via post requests). This does not block manual spam (submitted by spammers manually via browser).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='if%20mails%20are%20going%20in%20spam.'>\nIf mails are going in spam.\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>To avoid your email being marked as spam, it is highly recommended that your domain name in &#8216;From Email&#8217; must match with your website, i.e. if your website is example.com then your email must hosted on @example.com.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20the%20from%20address%20still%20show%20as%20the%20default%20or%20show%20up%20as%20%27sent%20on%20behalf%20of%27%20the%20default%20address%3F'>\nWhy does the From address still show as the default or show up as &#8216;sent on behalf of&#8217; the default address?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Possibly your mail server has added a Sender: header or is configured to always set the envelope sender to the user calling it.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20are%20emails%20not%20being%20sent%3F'>\nWhy are emails not being sent?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some hosts may refuse to relay mail from an unknown domain.
