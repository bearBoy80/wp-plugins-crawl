There is no way (that I saw of) to delete the data, manually, or even better, automatically after a number of days\/weeks\/ etc... As a result, especially in busy websites, your database will blow up out of control. \n\nI really like the filter I can apply to see the records per user, and the export feature. By deleting the plugin, not just deactivating it, the collected data are removed, but that's not a good way to run a professional website, is it?\n\nI would love to upgrade my rating to 5 stars, as soon as there is a feature built in to control the data (delete).\n\nNice job, thanks.\n\nUPDATE: As promised, I'm upgrading my rating to 5 stars ! <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/awesome-tracker.1.1.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/awesome-tracker\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2204089","caption":"Records listing"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/awesome-tracker\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2204089","caption":"API Routes configuration"}},"tags":{"analytics":"analytics","tracking":"tracking"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/awesome-tracker.1.0.zip","1.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/awesome-tracker.1.1.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/awesome-tracker.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/paypal.me\/devmoreira\/","banners":[]}
