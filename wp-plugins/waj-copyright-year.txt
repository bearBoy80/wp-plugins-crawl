By default, it just shows the current year, as specified by the server ( which is hopefully keeping accurate track o&#8217; time ). Optionally, you can include a start year. If the start year is different from the current year, then it will show an interval &#8216;tween the start year &amp; current year.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you set the start year to 2015, in 2018 you will get the following:<\/p>\n<pre><code>2015 - 2018\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>You can also set a custom divider if you want the interval sign to look different. For instance, if you don&#8217;t want the hyphen to have spaces round it, you could set the divider to &#8220;-&#8220;, &amp; you will get the following:<\/p>\n<pre><code>2015-2018\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\ndeclare( strict_types = 1 );\nnamespace MyTheme\\FooterTemplate\n{\n    use \\WaughJ\\CopyrightYear\\CopyrightYear;\n\n    ?&gt;\n        &lt;footer class=\"footer\"&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;Copyright Jaimeson Waugh &amp;copy; &lt;?= new CopyrightYear( 2015, '-' ); ?&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n        &lt;\/footer&gt;\n    &lt;?php\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<pre><code>[copyright-year start=\"2015\" divider=\"-\"]\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This will print the message, <code>Copyright Jaimeson Waugh \u00a9 2015-2018.<\/code><\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/plugin-name<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Copyright year can be directly added to PHP files by creating an instance o&#8217; the \\WaughJ\\CopyrightYear\\CopyrightYear class &amp; using it like a string or calling the &#8220;getText()&#8221;.
