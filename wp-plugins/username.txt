Every administrator can change only his\/her username from admin panel.<\/p>\n<p>After activation there is a sub menu in Settings called Username. Click on this and there is an option to change Username. Insert your new username and then in settings there is an option <strong>Click to check username is exist or not<\/strong> Click and check user is exist or not. If username already exist then it will alert you as <strong>Username In Use!<\/strong> in red color, else it will alert you <strong>Username Not In Use!<\/strong> in green color. If username is not exist and user click on submit then it will update username and it will redirect to login page. Now login with new username.<\/p>\n<p>Note Password remains same.

Often clients and friends set up WordPress before they know how they want it to look or feel. They choose usernames based on habit or screen name. For minor security (through obscurity) reasons I do not want admins, editors and authors logging in with their published screen name. Every WP blog has bots trying to brute force the login page. This along with \"Edit Author Slug\" plugin allows me to hide that information from search engines and bad guys. \n\nNote the username you want to change must be an admin for this plugin to work. I upgrade Editors, Authors and Subscribers to Admins, login as them an then change the username and downgrade back to previous role. This also lets me check the password is not too easy.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">This plugin causes a glitch in the Customize php page<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tajanator\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f31df55ca51efc0463afa1e9c79b65cd?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f31df55ca51efc0463afa1e9c79b65cd?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tajanator\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">tajanator<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>I installed this plugin while I was tinkering around on a new site that I am building for my in-laws.  I hadn't even gotten around to using it yet (to fix their main username login) when I went to fix a Customization within for the theme.  <\/p>\n<p>When I entered the Customize page, Customize screen went completely dead causing a loading loop.  After hours on wordpress.org trying to find out how that happened, several suggestions said to disable all plugins to see if it starts working again.  I disabled all plugins and like magic, the customize screen stopped loading and the page finally popped up!  Then, as suggested, I reactivated each plugin one by one testing the customize screen each time to find out which plugin cause the error.... and this was it.  This plugin is somehow linked to the PHP page which controls the customize screen and causes it to not load.<\/p>\n<p>I wasn't even able to use the plugin before having to remove it.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/username.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/username\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2827803","caption":"Admin page screenshot."}},"tags":{"admin":"admin","change-username":"Change Username","username-changer":"username changer"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
