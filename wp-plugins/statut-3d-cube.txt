Menu linking to the inner pages or other site.<br \/>\n2. Banner promoting 1-4 of your selling items or projects.<br \/>\n3. Mini gallery or portfolio to demonstrate &#8211; logos, photos, illustrations, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Top-6 features of 3D Cube:<br \/>\n1. Totally free: no ads, no Pro version<br \/>\n2. Works perfectly on mobile devices as well as on the desktop<br \/>\n3. Adapts automatically to the free space of the block in which it is placed<br \/>\n4. No coding required!
