Sometimes, you create a new category when you were before using a tag. Or you just forget about old tags and en up writing new ones with a very similar name.<\/p>\n<p>This damages the organization your content and the quality of the user navigation on your site.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin helps you to quickly identify (too) similar tags and categories and gives you the option to merge them to simplify your site taxonomies.<\/p>\n<p>In the <em>Configuration<\/em> page you can define how close term names should be to be considered duplicates.<\/p>\n<p>In the <em>Analysis<\/em> page you can review the duplications and decide which ones to merge.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Install and Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='should%20i%20create%20a%20backup%20of%20my%20site%20before%20using%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nShould I create a backup of my site before using the plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.

This could produce this effect. Just ignore the duplicate, since it has been already fixed, and it will disappear on its own later on once the provider flushes the cache.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested with WordPress 6.0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested with WordPress 5.4<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cleaned error messages<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added option to signal as duplicates only terms with the same exact name<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/serious-duplicated-terms\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2080637\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/serious-duplicated-terms\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2080637\" alt=\"Configuration page for the plugin\"><\/a><p>Configuration page for the plugin<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/serious-duplicated-terms\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2077519\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/serious-duplicated-terms\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2077519\" alt=\"Analysis page showing the duplicated categories and tags\"><\/a><p>Analysis page showing the duplicated categories and tags<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">You&#039;ll be surprised to see how many duplicated terms you have!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/seriouswp\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8a19b57a33032220d42dfe7ea109fa3d?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8a19b57a33032220d42dfe7ea109fa3d?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/seriouswp\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">seriouswp<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">June 2, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Ideal to remove some (quasi)duplicated terms and clean and sort out better your tags and categories<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/serious-duplicated-terms.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/serious-duplicated-terms\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2080637","caption":"Configuration page for the plugin"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/serious-duplicated-terms\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2077519","caption":"Analysis page showing the duplicated categories and tags"}},"tags":{"category":"category","duplicates":"duplicates","tag":"tag","taxonomy":"taxonomy","terms":"terms"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/serious-duplicated-terms\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2077526","high":false}}
