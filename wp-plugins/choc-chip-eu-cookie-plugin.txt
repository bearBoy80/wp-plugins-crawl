I&#8217;m not sure how true that is either, but in any case it has caused me to sit down and write this WordPress plugin to make abiding by the rules that bit easier.<\/p>\n<p>It gives your visitors the option to opt in to any third party applications such as Google Analytics or Ad Sense. The Choc Chip Cookie Plugin then leaves a cookie of its own to remember them next time. The cookie willl expire after one year. There are a few options with this little badger to help you comply with the EU cookie directive and also pimp it up to suit your website.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to ask a question go to http:\/\/www.christiansenior.co.uk\/talkin-shop\/choc-chip-eu-cookie-wordpress-plugin<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>To install the plugin manually:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Extract the contents of the archive (zip file)<\/li>\n<li>Upload the folder and its contents to your ?\/wp-content\/plugins? folder<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the Plugins section in your WordPress admin panel<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Usage<\/p>\n<p>Choc Chip Cookie EU Cookie Plugin Widget<\/p>\n<pre><code>This plugin comes with an opt-in widget for your sidebar. Anything added to the Choc Chip EU Cookie Plugin widget is opt in. So if you insert your Adsense code here it will only show if the visitor has accepted cookies. Cool uh?! \n\nOptions\n\nButton Bar Text\nEdit the warning text as shown on the button bar. Try something like 'Hey you, you are browsing my website so you are having cookies'. OK maybe not qute that but something similar.\n\nCookie Information Page\nCreate a page that contains your cookie information such as what cookies are and what you use them for. Select your cookie information page from the list and this will link to the 'More info' button on the button bar.\n\nOpt in header code\nThird party applications such as Google Analytics leave a cookie in order to be able to track your visitors. The EU Cookie Directive wants you to warn people of this and even have them 'opt in' so you shouldnt track them unless they agree to it. Any text\/code that you enter in the 'opt in header code' field will only be activated once the 'allow' button has been clicked. Any text\/code in this field will be placed just above the  &amp;lt;\/head&amp;gt;  tag.\n\nComment Form Warning\nWordpress leaves a cookie when a comment is left (to save the form information so it doesnt have to be filled in next time) so give your visitors a warning and let them whats going down. Try something like 'By leaving a comment you are agreeing to have a new friend in the same shape as a cookie popped onto your hard drive'.\n\nAppearance\n\nBar Position\nSelect the position for your button bar\n\nBackground Colour\nChange the background of your button bar by entering the name of the colour or if youre a smarty pants you can enter a hex value.\n\nText Colour\nChange the main text colour on the button bar by entering the name of the colour, now try to be sensible as 'off white' aint gonna cut the mustard sonny Jim.\n\nAccept Button Text Colour\nHave a guess what this does? Thats right it changes the accept button text colour. Pop your favourite colour in the box.\n\nAccept Button Background Colour\nMake that button stand out with a smashing background colour.\n\nAccept Button Border Colour\nThats right you can even change the colour of the border of the button. Your visitors will be sad to see it disappear when they click the button.\n\nMore Info Button Text Colour\nWe've moved on to the next button so make this one just as important as the last one as it points to important information\n\nMore Info Button Background Colour\nMake it shine man, make it shine\n\nMore Info Button Border Colour\nCome on this is the last colour change so make it count\n\nNow dont forget to press save after you make any changes.\n<\/code><\/pre>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/choc-chip-eu-cookie-plugin.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"cookies":"cookies","eu-cookie-directive":"eu cookie directive"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.christiansenior.co.uk","banners":[]}
