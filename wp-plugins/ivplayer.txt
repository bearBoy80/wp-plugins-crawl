Just imagine how cool it would be if your learners\/students would be able to grab code from the video player while you are teaching remotely<\/p>\n<p>Once you have installed the plugin,<br \/>\n1. You will see an option in the side menu saying <code>IV Player<\/code>. Click on it.<br \/>\n2. Then click on the <code>ADD NEW<\/code> button on the page.<br \/>\n3. Then you will see a page asking details for your first Video to play.<br \/>\n4. Once you have filled minimum details like <code>URL<\/code>, <code>name<\/code> then add the timings.<br \/>\n5. While filling the timings, you need to specify at which time duration what needs to be played on screen. For example, you can choose <code>00:00:10<\/code> and  <code>hello<\/code> in the <code>Text<\/code> box. That means at <code>00:00:10<\/code> time point, you will see <code>hello<\/code> being played on the video player screen.<br \/>\n6.  Currently, we have <code>Text<\/code>, <code>Code<\/code>, <code>File<\/code>, <code>Link<\/code> boxes ready.<br \/>\n7. Once the video is created, a <code>shortcode<\/code> will be seen on screen.
