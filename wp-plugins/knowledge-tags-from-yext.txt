Easy to implement using a Javascript library, Yext Knowledge Tags let you add Schema to your website with just a single line of code.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why do I need Knowledge Tags?<\/strong><br \/>\nIntelligent Services are answering questions about your brand every day. They are providing distinct experiences showing Locations, People, Menus and Events directly in the SERP, by voice, through chatbots and more.<\/p>\n<p>Intelligent services rely on structured data to provide these rich experiences \u2014 so you need to ensure the data about your brand is structured in a way these services understand.<\/p>\n<p>The structured data displayed to users is powered by Schema, which is a special markup placed on a web page. The problem with Schema is that it\u2019s often hard to create, and even harder to modify.<\/p>\n<p>Knowledge Tags Schema Markup helps your website speak the language of intelligent services so they can understand, categorize, and structure the information about your brand.<\/p>\n<p>With Knowledge Tags you can manage schema at scale and keep the data in sync with Yext Knowledge Graph and third party listings.<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: There will no longer be maintenance or support for this plugin beyond version 6.0. Please directly utilize the Knowledge Tags scripts, as explained in Yext\u2019s documentation: https:\/\/hitchhikers.yext.com\/guides\/working-with-knowledge-tags\/#script<\/p>\n<p><strong>Using Knowledge Tags<\/strong><br \/>\nUse Yext Knowledge Tags to automatically create marked up schema for your website. The information will come directly from the Yext Knowledge Graph. You can use shortcodes to generate fields such as hours of operation, phone numbers, and a link to your location in Google Maps.<\/p>\n<p>To use the Yext plugin, you must have an active Yext subscription. With the Yext Knowledge Engine, you can update, sync, enhance, and monitor your business listings across the web.
