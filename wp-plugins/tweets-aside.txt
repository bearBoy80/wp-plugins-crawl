Most plugins would give you a widget with your latest tweets. But, I thought it would be nice to have all your thoughts in one place and in one timeline.<\/p>\n<p>So, this plugin automatically posts your tweets to your blog. As your tweets don&#8217;t have titles, post format for them is aside. You may want to modify slightly your theme, to allow nice asides without titles.<\/p>\n<p>Posting is done automatically by wordpress built-in cron. You can set it up to run automatically each hour, twice daily or daily. That would depend on how often you blog or tweet.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>To install this plugin, upload a file called <code>tweets-aside.php<\/code> to your <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> folder and then activate plugin from your panel.<\/p>\n","faq":"<h4>How can I delete a post?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes, but never empty your trash or delete post from trash. Trashed posts are used to detect deleted posts.<\/p>\n<h4>Can I modify a tweet-post?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes, you can. Sync would not revert your post. Syncing is done by time. So if you modify your post, don&#8217;t touch post date and time.<\/p>\n<h4>Why not all my tweets are displayed?<\/h4>\n<p>Sometimes Twitter search returns just a portion of latest tweets. Maybe through few next tries more tweets would be found and posted.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.2<\/h4>\n<p>Now you can delete tweet-posts.<\/p>\n<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<p>Beta version to see if it works or not.<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/tweets-aside\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1444576\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/tweets-aside\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1444576\" alt=\"This is plugin options panel.
