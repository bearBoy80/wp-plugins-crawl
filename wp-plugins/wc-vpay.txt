When selected, the fields in step six will say &#8220;Test&#8221; instead of &#8220;Live.&#8221; Test mode enables you to test payments with your sandbox details before going live. You can uncheck this when your store is ready to accept real payments.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Transaction_Charge<\/strong> &#8211; Amount to be charged to paying customer in addition to the order amount above.

This indicates how the payment total should be computed using the order amount and txn_charge above. E.g. order amount = 1000, txn_charge = 5, txn_charge_type = \u201cpercentage\u201d then total = 1000 + (1000 * 5%) = 1000 + 50 = 1050.<\/li>\n<li><strong>API Keys<\/strong> &#8211; The next two text boxes are for your VPay API keys, which you can get from your VPay Dashboard.

This way, whenever a transaction is complete on your store, we&#8217;ll send a notification to the Webhook URL, which will update the order and mark it as paid. You can set this up by using the URL in red at the top of the Settings page. Just copy the URL and save it as your webhook URL on your VPay dashboard under <strong>Settings &gt; Webhooks<\/strong> tab.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you do not find VPay on the Payment method options, please go through the settings again and ensure that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You&#8217;ve checked the <strong>&#8220;Enable\/Disable&#8221;<\/strong> checkbox<\/li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve entered your <strong>API Keys<\/strong> in the appropriate field<\/li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve clicked on <strong>Save Changes<\/strong> during setup<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='what%20do%20i%20need%20to%20use%20the%20plugin'>\nWhat Do I Need To Use The Plugin\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>A VPay merchant account \u2014- use an existing account or <a href=\"https:\/\/vpay.africa\/signup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">create an account here<\/a><\/li>\n<li>An active <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/installing-uninstalling-woocommerce\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce installation<\/a><\/li>\n<li>A valid <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/ssl-and-https\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SSL Certificate<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A change since the previous version.<\/li>\n<li>Another change.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>List versions from most recent at top to oldest at bottom.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2916532\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2916532\" alt=\"To make payment through Bank transfer, choose the bank you are paying from and enter the last 4 digits of the account number you are paying from.\"><\/a><p>To make payment through Bank transfer, choose the bank you are paying from and enter the last 4 digits of the account number you are paying from.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2916532\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2916532\" alt=\"To make payment through USSD, dial the USSD code and confirm payment.\"><\/a><p>To make payment through USSD, dial the USSD code and confirm payment.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2916532\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2916532\" alt=\"Check all payment details before confirming payment.\"><\/a><p>Check all payment details before confirming payment.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2916532\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2916532\" alt=\"Feedback confirming that payment was successful.\"><\/a><p>Feedback confirming that payment was successful.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wc-vpay.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2916532","caption":"To make payment through Bank transfer, choose the bank you are paying from and enter the last 4 digits of the account number you are paying from."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2916532","caption":"To make payment through USSD, dial the USSD code and confirm payment."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2916532","caption":"Check all payment details before confirming payment."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2916532","caption":"Feedback confirming that payment was successful."}},"tags":{"dare-kolawole-plugins":"Dare Kolawole plugins","payment-gateway":"payment gateway","verve":"verve","vpay":"vpay","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"https:\/\/example.com\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2916532","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wc-vpay\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2916532"}}
