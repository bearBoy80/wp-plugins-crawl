It provides a valuable way to reach and keep in touch with potential sellers every month. I love that it provides automated sold alerts by email every month so I can nurture my prospects without being a pest. Aside from getting me more listing prospects, I don't have to spend hours creating manual reports and sending emails every month. Sold Alerts does all of this automatically. Thanks for building this!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sold-alerts.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sold-alerts\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1634831","caption":"Sign Up Form"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sold-alerts\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1634831","caption":"Sold Alert Email"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sold-alerts\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=1634831","caption":"Sold Alerts Settings Screen"}},"tags":{"home-sales":"home sales","real-estate":"real-estate","sold-email":"sold email","sold-home-alerts":"sold home alerts"},"versions":{"1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sold-alerts.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sold-alerts.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sold-alerts.1.3.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sold-alerts.1.4.zip","1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sold-alerts.1.5.zip","1.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/sold-alerts.1.6.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/wordpress.org","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/sold-alerts\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1634851","high":false}}
