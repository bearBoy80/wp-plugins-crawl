After looking around for an already existing plugin I realized nobody had created one yet and decided to do it myself.  This is my first WP plugin and I hope you enjoy!  Feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, etc.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Usage: Add the widget to your sidebar.  Set the Title to whatever you want the header of the widget to say, and set the Realm Name to the desired name of a US World of Warcraft realm.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Credits<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/profile\/rickgc\" rel=\"ugc\">Ricardo Gonz?lez<\/a> &#8211; This plugin is almost a clone of Ricardo&#8217;s Twitter for WordPress plugins.
