This quantity may be set differently for each customer and differently for each product (6 SKU limit at this time).<\/p>\n<p>This allocation tool may be applied in situations where products have limited availability and demand exceeds supply. To ensure customers are given an opportunity to purchase the products, set maximum quantity limits for each product. Apply different maximums to different customers to reward loyalty or for other preferential treatment.<\/p>\n<p>To set the allocation, go to the WordPress dashboard -&gt; WooCommerce -&gt; Settings and click on the \u201cAllocations\u201d tab. The table may be filled in with as few as one SKU and one Tier or as many as 6 of each to set the maximum quantity a customer is allowed to purchase a product. Enter the start and end dates for the allocation and chose whether you want to apply the allocation to all customer at once (BEWARE THIS IS IRREVERSABLE). Then go to the WordPress dashboard -&gt; Users -&gt; Click \u201cAdd New\u201d or click \u201cEdit\u201d under an existing user. Scroll down to \u201cAllocation Tier \u201c. Set the Tier corresponding to the entry you made in the allocation table. NOTE: a customer must be logged in to be able to purchase. New customers will be informed on screen if they try to purchase without an allocation with this warning: \u201cYou must be logged in and have an allocation.

No, not until you set the allocation on the back end. New customers will be informed on screen if they try to purchase without an allocation with this warning: \u201cYou must be logged in and have an allocation. Please login or join.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Can I require a minimum purchase of any product? Not at this time. Contact me to request this revision.<\/p>\n<p>Why are there only 6 SKU options? If this is not enough, contact me to request a revision.<\/p>\n<p>How can I set an allocation tier to a group of customers at once? Unless that group is every customer (see installation instruction #7), then it is not possible with this version.  We will offer a pro version with this feature in the future.
