These info are automaticaly retrieved and are:<\/p>\n<p>*Google PR<br \/>\n*Technorati authority<br \/>\n*Alexa Rank<br \/>\n*Feedburner readers<\/p>\n<p>From the admin interface you can add\/remove links and issue updates on their stats. You can also set if the link that will be publicaly displayed will be &#8220;follow&#8221; or &#8220;nofollow&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Beware that updating the stats on the sites can be a very long process taken on the server. This means that if you issue a total update it might take some time before the page is done loading. That is not caused because the script is stuck but because it is retreiving info that takes time. Be patient and don&#8217;t do this every day. A good practice would be once a month.<\/p>\n<h3>Requirements<\/h3>\n<p>None what so ever&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3>Credits<\/h3>\n<p>Yan from http:\/\/thoushallblog.com has helped me on the development and debugging.<\/p>\n<h3>Contact<\/h3>\n<p>Suggestion, fixes, rants, congratulations, gifts etc to stratosg@stratosector.net<br \/>\nAlso visit the plugin&#8217;s page at http:\/\/www.stratos.me\/wp-plugins\/pr-checker\/<br \/>\nI would also appreciate if you donated any amount to me as a token of appreciation.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Activate like any plugin.
