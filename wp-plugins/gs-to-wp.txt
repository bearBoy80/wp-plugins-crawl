Maybe they will be regularly linked when the domain is the same. I'll do the edit once I do the transfer on the real website).<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/gs-to-wp.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"data":"data","getsimple":"getsimple","import":"import","sql":"sql"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/gs-to-wp.1.0.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.boiteasite.fr\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/gs-to-wp\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1542512","high":false}}
