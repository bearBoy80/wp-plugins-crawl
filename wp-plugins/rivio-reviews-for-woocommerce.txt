They are what 9 out of 10 people look for at first when they find a product they like. But these can be a hassle to collect. More than ever, customers rely on the opinions of others to help them make purchase decisions. Reviews help potential customers feel that they know what they\u2019re getting. They feel that this first hand information is honest, accurate and therefore very useful to them. Reviews build trust and confidence.<\/p>\n<p>Before RIVIO, it took a lot of time to build your product review section and create traction and community around your brand. For new businesses, or businesses that simply haven\u2019t been in the digital space earlier, lack of such a tool can already mean serious disadvantage in sales and profit to companies who have a more competitive price with relevant customer reviews to back it up.<\/p>\n<p>RIVIO is a full service review solution that is built with a special AI based tool, the RIVIO FusionFilter, that allows webshops from all over the world to share real product reviews. This means that any reviews written by other webshop&#8217;s customers about any product you\u2019re selling can immediately be displayed after installation on your site as your own. This unique review aggregation feature is a powerful tool for all those who understand the importance and want much more reviews on their shops. RIVIO optimizes review generation costs and efforts and maximizes traffic and sales to your e-commerce site.<\/p>\n<p>Our FREE WooCommerce plugin offers the followings:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Smart &amp; efficient review generation<\/strong> by using post-purchase emails;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Automated and customizable post purchase<\/strong> follow-up <strong>emails<\/strong> reaching optimal results;<\/li>\n<li>Thousands of <strong>reviews already available<\/strong> in our network powered <strong>by the RIVIO FusionFilter solution<\/strong>;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Single-click setup<\/strong> and expert customer support;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Simple migration<\/strong> from former review service;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Seamless integration into your webshop\u2019s design<\/strong> including <strong>mobile-optimization<\/strong>;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Plus lot of additional features to cherry-pick from, like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Top analytics and cross-selling statistics<\/strong> for efficient upsell and marketing strategy;<\/li>\n<li><strong>SEO optimized<\/strong> operation, including <strong>Google AdWords Star Snippet<\/strong> and <strong>Google Product Listing<\/strong>;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social integration<\/strong> &#8211; easy to share on Facebook, Twitter and all;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&#8230;and many more with our development team available to any questions and ideas you had.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Check out our website for more features and information @ <a href=\"www.getrivio.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http:\/\/www.getrivio.com<\/a> !<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>TRY RIVIO NOW TO START BUILDING TRUST &amp; DRIVE SALES<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>LIVE DEMO<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>View our demo shop for a live demo of RIVIO at<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/rivio-reviews-demo.myshopify.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http:\/\/rivio-reviews-demo.myshopify.com\/<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>Minimum Requirements<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP version 5.2.0 or greater<\/li>\n<li>WordPress 3.5.1 or greater<\/li>\n<li>WooCommerce plugin<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Install Rivio from the wordpress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.<\/li>\n<li>Activate Rivio and click on the Rivio menu in the left side bar of your WordPress admin.<\/li>\n<li>Register an account to Rivio or log in with your existing account.<\/li>\n<li>Customize the Rivio plugin with the different settings you can find on the settings page.

There was a few issues (one plugin bug, and one issue related directly to my website) - the team replied to me straight away on FB and worked with me for 1 hour straight and solved every issue (including my wordpress personal issue). Cannot recommend highly enough - you will love the product and the service.
