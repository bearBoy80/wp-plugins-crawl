In my hunt, I came across this and installed it. I like that I can choose between showing individual tracks or album covers. \n\nI prefer the album covers, but I wish that they actually linked back to either my LastFM profile or to the pages that say more about the artist, album, or track. As is, it's information that I know about who\/what that album cover represents, but the site visitor is left to guess. It is also problematic that album covers show with duplication. If you listen to a full album, the same cover displays multiple times. \n\nAgain, it's a nice start! I hope the developer continues to tweak it so that it becomes the tool that LastFM or Spotify should have developed themselves!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/trancelantic-playlist.1.2.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/trancelantic-playlist\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2233600","caption":"Your currently played song."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/trancelantic-playlist\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2233600","caption":"Customize your playlist."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/trancelantic-playlist\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2233600","caption":"Your currently played track in your top menu."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/trancelantic-playlist\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2233600","caption":"Your currently played track and a recently track cover gallery in your footer."},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/trancelantic-playlist\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2233600","caption":"Cover Gallery of your recently played tracks."},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/trancelantic-playlist\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=2233600","caption":"Your last played songs."},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/trancelantic-playlist\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=2233600","caption":"Trancelantic Playlist widget admin page."},"8":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/trancelantic-playlist\/assets\/screenshot-8.png?rev=2233600","caption":"Trancelantic Playlist widget admin page."},"9":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/trancelantic-playlist\/assets\/screenshot-9.png?rev=2233600","caption":"Page on error."}},"tags":{"currently_played_songs":"currently_played_songs","last-fm":"Last FM","playlist":"playlist","scrobbling":"scrobbling","spotify":"Spotify"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/trancelantic-playlist.1.0.0.zip","1.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/trancelantic-playlist.1.1.0.zip","1.2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/trancelantic-playlist.1.2.0.zip","1.2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/trancelantic-playlist.1.2.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/trancelantic-playlist.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/trancelantic-playlist\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2230672","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/trancelantic-playlist\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2230672"}}
