For each query, the profiler displays the time, syntax-highlighted SQL, and a trace of the functions (as well as the file and line number that the functions were called from) that were called.<\/p>\n<p>The list can be sorted by any of its columns, so you can, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Order the list by ID to see the chronological order of the queries<\/li>\n<li>Order the list by time to see the slowest queries<\/li>\n<li>Order the list by query to group the queries by type (SELECT, UPDATE, etc)<\/li>\n<li>Order the list by trace to group the queries by similar origins<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The list can also filtered by typing in the search box, so you can, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>View all queries that use the wp_posts table<\/li>\n<li>View all queries that are related to the use of a function in taxonomy.php<\/li>\n<li>View all queries that are related to the use of a specific function or class<\/li>\n<li>View all queries that call a specific MySQL function<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To turn off syntax highlighting, put the following in wp-config.php:<\/p>\n<pre><code>define('MP_HIGHLIGHT_SYNTAX', false);\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>To omit the file and line number from the function trace and display the functions as a comma-separated list (to save vertical space), define the following in wp-config.php:<\/p>\n<pre><code>define('MP_DISPLAY_FILES', false);\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This plugin was loosely based on <a href=\"http:\/\/bueltge.de\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Frank Bueltge<\/a>&#8216;s <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/debug-queries\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Debug Queries<\/a> plugin, so a hearty thanks to him for the development of that.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to grab development releases, see what new features are being added, or browse the source code please visit\/follow the <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/tombenner\/mysql-profiler\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repo<\/a>.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Put <code>mysql-profiler<\/code> into the <code>wp-content\/plugins<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin in the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; menu in WordPress to turn on the profiling<\/li>\n<li>Deactivate when you&#8217;ve finished using the profiling<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Is feature X available?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s widely-needed functionality that you&#8217;d like that isn&#8217;t implemented, I&#8217;d likely be willing to implement it myself or to accept any well-written code that implements it.
