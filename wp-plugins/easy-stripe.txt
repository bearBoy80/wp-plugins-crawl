Each button that you make will display a Stripe button on your site. The plugin lets you make as many Stripe buttons as you want, there are no limits.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin adds a new icon above your WordPress editor. So when you edit (or make a new) page or post, you can click this icon and insert a Stripe button onto your page, in just one click. You also have the option of manually placing a shortcode on your page or post to display the Stripe button.<\/p>\n<p>Each Stripe button is customizable, you can change the product description, price, if you want to collect a shipping address, and more.<\/p>\n<h4>Orders<\/h4>\n<p>View customer orders inside your WordPress admin dashboard. See the order total, customers shipping details, email address, Stripe transaction id, and more.<\/p>\n<h4>Emails<\/h4>\n<p>With built in email support, customers will get an email after purchase. As an admin, you can also choose to get an email whenever a sale is made.<\/p>\n<p>Email can be customized and can include order variables such as amount, product description, order number, and more.<\/p>\n<h4>Refunds<\/h4>\n<p>No one likes refunds, but they are a part of doing business. Easy Stripe makes it very easy to issue a customer a refund. In your admin dashboard, just view an order, and with two clicks you can issue the customer a refund.<\/p>\n<h4>Reports<\/h4>\n<p>This plugin comes with beautiful built in graphical reports. See your sales overview for this month or year. View purchase by date and even by hour.<\/p>\n<h4>Need Help?<\/h4>\n<p>If you have any problems or questions, please go to the Support tab and create a new topic.<\/p>\n<h4>Easy Stripe Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited Stripe buttons on your site<\/li>\n<li>View orders inside your WordPress dashboard<\/li>\n<li>Amazing built in reports<\/li>\n<li>Customers will receive an email after their purchase<\/li>\n<li>Receive an email whenever an item sells<\/li>\n<li>Issue refunds from inside the plugin<\/li>\n<li>Built in support for 12 languages<\/li>\n<li>Built in support 135 currencies<\/li>\n<li>Testing mode<\/li>\n<li>Fully mobile responsive<\/li>\n<li>Collect shipping details<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>About the Developers<\/h4>\n<p>We love building eCommerce software for WordPress.
