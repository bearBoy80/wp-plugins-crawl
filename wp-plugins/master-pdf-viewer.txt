As easy to use as adding photographs! Your PDF files will automatically resize to their proper dimensions. Additionally, if you indicate a width, the proper height will be determined automatically. The embedded PDF will display flawlessly on any device thanks to the responsive design of our Master PDF Viewer plugin.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin uses only Javascript in a special way to embed PDF files. This gives you a ton of choice when it comes to how your document will look.<\/p>\n<p>If some parts of a PDF file are too small for your screen, you can zoom in and out using the Next and Previous buttons on the PDF viewer.<\/p>\n<p>All Javascript and other files are supplied by your own server, and your PDF files are embedded within your already-existing WordPress sites so that we have complete control over appearance (not by Google or any other third-party who may not be able to guarantee their own reliability). This implies that there will be no speed degradation when loading your PDF files.<\/p>\n<h4>Usage<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Once installed and Activated, click Add new block from any page or post, just like adding an image, but drag and drop a PDF file instead.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>When you insert into your post, it will appear in the editor as a &#8216;Gutenberg Block&#8217; as follows:<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>You can change the default appearance &#8211; e.g. width, and toolbar position\/appearance through <strong>Settings -&gt; PDF Viewer<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","installation":"<p>Easiest way:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to your WordPress admin control panel&#8217;s plugin page<\/li>\n<li>Search for &#8216;Master PDF Viewer&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Click Install<\/li>\n<li>Click Activate on the plugin<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you cannot install from the WordPress plugins directory for any reason, and need to install from ZIP file:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload directory and contents to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory, or upload the ZIP file directly in<br \/>\nthe Plugins section of your WordPress admin<\/li>\n<li>Follow the instructions from step 4 above<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20obtain%20support%20for%20this%20product%3F'>\nHow can I obtain support for this product?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We may occasionally be able to respond to support queries posted on the &#8216;Support&#8217; forum here on the wordpress.org plugin page, but we recommend sending us an email instead if possible.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20change%20the%20size%20or%20customize%20the%20toolbar%3F'>\nHow can I change the Size or customize the Toolbar?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>See Settings -&gt; Master PDF Viewer in your WordPress admin to change site-wide defaults.
