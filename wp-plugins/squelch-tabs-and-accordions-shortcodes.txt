The plural tags (accordions, haccordions, tabs, toggles) are wrappers that define the group of tabs or accordions. The singular shortcodes (accordion, haccordion, tab, toggle) represent the individual content items within each group.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I use the plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Full instructions can be found on the <a href=\"http:\/\/squelchdesign.com\/wordpress-plugin-squelch-tabs-accordions-shortcodes\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes<\/a> project home page on the Squelch Web Design website.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20look%20of%20the%20widgets%3F'>\nCan I change the look of the widgets?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin creates jQuery UI accordions and tabs, jQuery UI-compatible toggles, and the horizontal accordions have been set up to use jQuery UI themes by default. So changing the jQuery UI theme in use on the page will change the appearance of the widgets. To change the jQuery UI theme simply go to Appearance &gt; Tabs and Accordions and choose a theme from the dropdown menu.<\/p>\n<p>You can also style the widgets with your own custom CSS if you wish by using the .squelch-taas-override class, but that is beyond the scope of this FAQ.

The initial goal of the plugin was to provide compatibility with that plugin as a way for those who&#8217;ve been left stranded by the demise of TheThe Tabs and Accordions plugin to continue using their accordions, horizontal accordions, tabs and toggles. I&#8217;ve changed some of the defaults for the widgets from what TheThe Tabs and Accordions used so if you&#8217;ve not been explicit when creating shortcodes you may notice some changes. I believe the defaults are better and more in line with what most people will want. Also, some minor functionality has still not been implemented so if you rely on those functions you might spot a few inconsistencies. Feel free to raise a support request on the plugin forum if functionality you require is missing.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20a%20fork%20of%20thethe%20tabs%20and%20accordions%3F'>\nIs this a fork of TheThe Tabs and Accordions?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This plugin has been written from the ground up as a new plugin that happens to be compatible with TheThe Tabs and Accordions.

These are JavaScript libraries that are relied upon by the plugin. Versions of WordPress prior to 3.5 shipped with an older copy of these scripts that is too old for this plugin to use.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on an older version of WordPress and still want to use the plugin then you will need to load a newer version of jQuery and jQuery UI. jQuery is pretty straightforward to upgrade (see the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/jquery-updater\/\" rel=\"ugc\">jQuery updater plugin<\/a>) but I&#8217;ve not been able to find a plugin that does the same thing for jQuery UI. Maybe if I can find time I&#8217;ll write a plugin that offers this functionality, if I can get it past certain members of the WordPress.org plugin review team. It&#8217;s also possible to add some code to your theme to achieve this goal, I&#8217;ll try and put some documentation together for this shortly.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='are%20these%20widgets%20responsive%3F'>\nAre these widgets responsive?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>All widgets is in this plugin are responsive excluding the horizontal accordion widget: It uses a different library to the other widgets, and that library is unfortunately not responsive. We may add a responsive horizontal slider in the future, but it is not available yet.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20link%20to%20a%20tab%3F'>\nCan I link to a tab?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! As of version 0.3.7 it is possible to link to a tab. The easiest way to achieve this is to open the tab you want to link to and, if you take a look at the page address, it should change as you click the tab. If you copy and paste this address it should link directly to the tab you have chosen.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.4.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested up to WP5.5<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.4.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fix: The new vanity URL code was causing an issue on PHP5 websites.

Apparently this contravenes the WordPress.org directory guidelines, despite the fact that the guidelines seem to make no mention of jQuery anywhere and despite the fact there are a number of plugins in the directory that do exactly the same thing. In order to get the plugin relisted it was necessary to use the WordPress-hosted version of jQuery and package the jQuery UI theme files. As a result the plugin no longer works on WP&lt;3.5 and there&#8217;s not much I can do about that.<\/li>\n<li>When you upgrade WordPress you may find that none of your widgets work any more due to a change in version of jQuery.

Even though it is very far from perfect, after the pain other developers put me through, I have to appreciate quality of this one.\n\n- Very fast, no content jumping\n- Content of tabs is within Wordpress posts thanks to properly done shortcodes, not like in most of plugins where 1 shortcode = 1 tab of content created in plugin's interface\n- Starting theme is good and neutral enough to actually suffice for most of websites\n- There is a multitude of other themes to be picked in plugin's settings\n\nNow the bad:\n- No built in responsiveness for horizontal tabs\n- No Font Awesome icons for tab titles\n\nSome additional thoughts:\n\nCan't set things like font size, but it can easily be changed through CSS, so no problem for me. It's a bit misleading that settings are under Appearance menu and on installed plugins list there is no settings option for this plugin what at start led me to think there are no settings at all. I think that some preview of available themes would be nice, checking them one by one is quite a chore and I couldn't find any online source for these themes.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Couldn&#039;t get to work and support helped fix it.
