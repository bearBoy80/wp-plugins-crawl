By adding a &#8220;utm_content&#8221; parameter you can change the visual behaviour of your website to better address visitors who came from different places.<\/p>\n<p>After configuring the plugin in the settings you can use a shortcode for displaying the name of your audience. For example place the shortcode:<\/p>\n<pre><code>[audience default=\"Webdesigner\" alternative=\"1\"]\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>on your page. By default &#8220;Webdesigner&#8221; is displayed.<\/p>\n<p>But if you append an &#8220;utm_content&#8221; parameter like &#8220;?utm_content=1&#8221; in the address bar, the shortcode will display the first alternative of your set audience with ID 1 (maybe &#8220;Online-Marketers&#8221;).<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>targetaudience<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Configure the plugin in the settings by adding audiences<\/li>\n<li>Place the shortcode on your page<\/li>\n<li>Control the output by adding the equivalent &#8220;utm_content&#8221; to the address bar<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>What is needed for setting up the plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No coding is needed for setting up the plugin.
