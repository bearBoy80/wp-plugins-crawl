Once you&#8217;ve created a datebox field in the Buddypress profiles and referenced it in the TLDC Birthdays widget settings, the widget will display the list of either all BP users or just the connected user&#8217;s friends whose birthday is today and also, if you like, the list of upcoming birthdays within the next n days. Plugin now supports Andy Peatling&#8217;s Buddypress Followers plugin when installed, so that you can also track the birthdays of people you follow.<\/p>\n<p>So to sum up, in order to get things to work, you&#8217;ll need :<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A birthday field in the Buddypress extended profile settings<\/li>\n<li>Users to fill it out in their profiles<\/li>\n<li>The TDLC Birthdays widget properly installed and set up (see <em>Installation<\/em>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Features :<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Display only friends, or followed people (if BuddyPress Followers plugin is installed), or everybody&#8217;s birthday<\/li>\n<li>Display upcoming birthdays within a range of your choice, or just today&#8217;s birthdays<\/li>\n<li>Hide or show ages<\/li>\n<li>Optionally suggest your users to fill out their birth date if not already done<\/li>\n<li>Multiple widget instances now supported !<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remarks :<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Localized! Currently English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian and Spanish languages are included. Many thanks to the translators!<\/li>\n<li>Sounds obvious but in &#8220;display friends only&#8221; mode, as you only see your friend&#8217;s birthdays, you wont see your own birthday in the widget. This does not mean that your friends don&#8217;t see it either! Same thing goes with the Followers option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Settings<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In order to get the widget working, you need to fill out the <em>Birthday field Name<\/em> (or ID). The Birthday field must have been previously created in the <em>Buddypress profile page<\/em> (and it should be a <em>datebox<\/em> type field). Of course, the users must also fill it out on their profile pages&#8230;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The other settings are self-explanatory (or at least I hope so).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Known Issues<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Some translations are incomplete. The new strings related to the &#8216;Followers&#8217; plugin support added in v0.2.5 is not translated yet except for French and English.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you find any other bugs or want to request some additional features for future releases (which I may consider if I&#8217;ve got time), please post a comment on the plugin homepage.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the archive and expand it.<\/li>\n<li>Upload the <em>tdlc-birthdays<\/em> folder into your <em>wp-content\/plugins\/<\/em> directory<\/li>\n<li>In your <em>WordPress Administration Area<\/em>, go to the <em>Plugins<\/em> page and click <em>Activate<\/em> for <em>TDLC Birthdays<\/em><\/li>\n<li>In the <em>Widgets<\/em> page, you can now add the Birthday plugin wherver you like.
