Icons that match your site&#8217;s theme will be added to quotes and appear in a contextual menu when readers select text on your website, allowing them to quickly and easily share the quotes to Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin adds a page link, hashtags and mentions to shared quotes. WordPress tags are used as hashtags and, if you use Yoast&#8217;s WordPress SEO plugin, the post author&#8217;s and site&#8217;s Twitter accounts are added as mentions to Tweets.<\/p>\n<h3>Sponsorship<\/h3>\n<p>I am software engineer and I love to create free and open source software for nomads, bloggers and language learners. In order to afford to spend time creating, maintaining and updating my free software, I rely on financial support from donors. In return, I provide my donors with access to exclusive updates, support and features.

Visit a page and highlight some text in the main content and you should see the Quotable toolbar pop up. Visit a page or post with quote blocks, and you should see the Quotable icon added at the end of the quote. See the FAQ for more information about available options and settings.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>\nCan I turn off the functionality just for blockquotes or just for text selection?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Go to Settings &gt; Discussion &gt; Quotable to enable or disable plugin features site-wide. You can enable or disable features for individual pages and posts from the Quotable section in the Document tab of the post editor. If you want to enable or disable the icon for individual quotes, you can do so from the Quotable section in the Block settings tab when editing the quote block.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nCan you add the option to share quotes on more social networks?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in having the option to share quotes via Facebook, Reddit, Hacker News or email, I am developing these features in a separate plugin exclusively for sponsors. If you would like to receive exclusive updates and features, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/localjo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">sponsor me on Patreon<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nHow do I make shared quotes mention the author&#8217;s Twitter account?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use Yoast&#8217;s WordPress SEO plugin to set a site-wide Twitter account and a Twitter account for each author. When a tweet is created with Quotable, the post author&#8217;s Twitter account will be mentioned in the tweet, and Twitter will recommend that people follow the site-wide Twitter account after they share the tweet.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nHow do I add hashtags to the shared content?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Hashtags are generated based on the WordPress tags that were used on the post. If you want more control over which hashtags are generated, I am developing these features in a separate plugin exclusively for sponsors.
