New users will have to reset their passwords in order to login.<\/li>\n<li>Posts &#8211; Synchronises ALL posts, including pages and all custom post types. Preserves post parent relationships<\/li>\n<li>Taxonomies &#8211; Synchronises all taxonomy terms, but both sites need to have the same taxonomies defined. Ie. if the theme defines custom taxonomies, both sites must have the same theme active.<\/li>\n<li>Attachments &#8211; Synchronises attachments. Attachment images are downloaded directly from the source site and then inserted into the media library and linked up to the same posts as in the source site.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can choose which of these to activate before performing a sync but some rely on others to run first before they themselves are able to run.<\/p>\n<p>For now WordSync transmits site data between the sites in an unencrypted stream. While eavesdropping is extremely unlikely, bear this in mind if you have sensitive data.<\/p>\n<p>WordSync is designed to be used by developers and other super-users who work with WordPress sites. The plugin will expose a bit of the inner workings of WordPress to you and requires your judgement to know which data should be synced without overwriting data you&#8217;d like to keep.<\/p>\n<h3>** Warning **<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin modifies your site content and is still in alpha. It may not always perform adequately and it would be <strong>strongly advisable<\/strong> to backup your site before using WordSync. WordSync does not offer a rollback option once your data has been synced. Brave Digital does not accept any responsibility for lost or corrupted data. USE THIS PLUGIN AT YOUR OWN RISK.<\/p>\n<h3>Contribute on GitHub<\/h3>\n<p>Help us make improvements and additions by contributing on the WordSync GitHub project:<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/github.com\/brave-digital\/WordSync<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>The plugin is required to be installed and activated on <em>both<\/em> the source and target sites.<\/p>\n<p>Install the plugin as per usual, through the WordPress plugin repository or by uploading the zip file manually to your site and activate it on both sites.<\/p>\n<p>Once activated, you can find the plugin under <em>Tools -&gt; WordSync<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You will need to go into the WordSync Settings on each site (by clicking the &#8216;Settings&#8217; button in the header) and set a identical Secret Key for both sites.

If you find a bug, please open a support ticket on our GitHub page or even better, submit a pull-request which fixes the issue to our GitHub repo.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Do both sites need to be online for syncing to work?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, but the source site needs to be accessible from the internet. So you can sync your localhost with a source site on the internet, but a site on the internet would not be able to sync with your localhost unless you set up your home internet to allow public connections to your localhost server.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>User processor now handles user roles correctly.<\/li>\n<li>User processor now based on user_logins and not user_emails as logins are not changable after creation.<\/li>\n<li>Added settings postprocessing and excluded some settings which were harmful to migrate.<\/li>\n<li>Changed admin screen to use POST instead of GET to avoid URI too long messages.<\/li>\n<li>Changes are now processed in type order (update then delete then create)<\/li>\n<li>Added better error handling while processing changes.<\/li>\n<li>Added Cannot delete the current user check.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wordsync\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1629029\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wordsync\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1629029\" alt=\"The main WordSync interface showing the choice of processors available.\"><\/a><p>The main WordSync interface showing the choice of processors available.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wordsync\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1629029\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wordsync\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1629029\" alt=\"The review stage of a sync job in progress.\"><\/a><p>The review stage of a sync job in progress.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Missing Settings page<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/huimingdeng\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/224e4333e7aef5a209592c30ecee8db7?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/224e4333e7aef5a209592c30ecee8db7?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/huimingdeng\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">huimingdeng<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 7, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">The test plugin lacks configuration pages from 4.8.4 to 4.9.1 in WordPress.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wordsync.0.1.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wordsync\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1629029","caption":"The main WordSync interface showing the choice of processors available."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wordsync\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1629029","caption":"The review stage of a sync job in progress."}},"tags":{"backup":"backup","merge":"merge","migration":"migration","sync":"sync","synchronise":"synchronise"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wordsync.0.1.zip","0.1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wordsync.0.1.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wordsync.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wordsync\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=1644696","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wordsync\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=1644696"}}
