What can motivate visitors? I think it can be something tasty available only in feed. So I made WordPress plugin FeedOnly which hides from blog visitors the parts of posts you want to show only to your subscribers.<\/p>\n<p>Parts to be hidden for visitors have to be enclosed in tags &lt;!??hide??&gt; and &lt;!??\/hide??&gt;. These parts will be available for RSS subscribers only and that will be said to visitors.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>feedonly.php<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Localization<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/coolidea.ru\/2008\/06\/07\/feedonly\/\" title=\"FeedOnly plugin page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Russian<\/a><\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","faq":"<p>Any questions?
