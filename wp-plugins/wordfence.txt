Wordfence is now activated.<\/li>\n<li>Go to the scan menu and start your first scan. Scheduled scanning will also be enabled.<\/li>\n<li>Once your first scan has completed, a list of threats will appear. Go through them one by one to secure your site.<\/li>\n<li>Visit the Wordfence options page to enter your email address so that you can receive email security alerts.<\/li>\n<li>Optionally, change your security level or adjust the advanced options to set individual scanning and protection options for your site.<\/li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Live Traffic&#8221; menu option to watch your site activity in real-time. Situational awareness is an important part of website security.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>To install Wordfence on WordPress Multi-Site installations:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install Wordfence via the plugin directory or by uploading the ZIP file.<\/li>\n<li>Network Activate Wordfence. This step is important because until you network activate it, your sites will see the plugin option on their plugins menu. Once activated that option disappears. <\/li>\n<li>Now that Wordfence is network activated it will appear on your Network Admin menu. Wordfence will not appear on any individual site&#8217;s menu. <\/li>\n<li>Go to the &#8220;Scan&#8221; menu and start your first scan. <\/li>\n<li>Wordfence will do a scan of all files in your WordPress installation including those in the blogs.dir directory of your individual sites. <\/li>\n<li>Live Traffic will appear for ALL sites in your network. If you have a heavily trafficked system you may want to disable live traffic which will stop logging to the DB. <\/li>\n<li>Firewall rules and login rules apply to the WHOLE system. So if you fail a login on site1.example.com and site2.example.com it counts as 2 failures. Crawler traffic is counted between blogs, so if you hit three sites in the network, all the hits are totalled and that counts as the rate you&#8217;re accessing the system.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordfence.com\/help\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Visit our website to access our official documentation which includes security feature descriptions, common solutions and comprehensive help.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<dt id='how%20does%20wordfence%20security%20protect%20sites%20from%20attackers%3F'>\nHow does Wordfence Security protect sites from attackers?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The WordPress security plugin provides the best protection available for your website.

across your plugin, I had to clean the site from viruses, I saw what a useless plugin is. And point by point, while I'm writing here, I'll publish an article later. You are not the worst, but you position yourself as the best, so the first is for you. So I'll start. 1. The plugin is looking for an infection, but can't clear everything. Okay, let's make a discount it can't clean everything, but why can't it even clean simple files like index.php and wp-config.php - from simple include - he writes that he is infected, but I can't clean it. 2. The plugin can find viruses 10 times a day, but it cannot protect the system files from infection in any way. And tell me what then remains of your plugin in terms of efficiency? Pay you money to clean it, and tomorrow everything will get infected again? It turns out that the plugin does not protect your site in any way and it is of no use just as infection statistics.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wordfence.7.11.0.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wordfence\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2087795","caption":"The dashboard gives you an overview of your site's security including notifications, attack statistics and Wordfence feature status."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wordfence\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2087795","caption":"The firewall protects your site from common types of attacks and known security vulnerabilities."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wordfence\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2087795","caption":"The Wordfence Security Scanner lets you know if your site has been compromised and alerts you to other security issues that need to be addressed."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wordfence\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2087795","caption":"Wordfence is highly configurable, with a deep set of options available for each feature.
