Out of the box, Total Slider does <em>not<\/em> provide a way to edit your theme, add previous\/next buttons, and otherwise customise the look of the slider without diving into code.<\/p>\n<p>It does, however, ship with three built-in templates and is very easy to use if you are happy using those.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a slider solution that won&#8217;t involve editing code to set it up, Total Slider probably is not for you.<\/p>\n<h4>How it works<\/h4>\n<p>Total Slider allows you to create a number of \u2018slide groups\u2019. Each slide in the group can be given a title, some description text, a background image and, optionally, a link. You can then have these displayed in a slideshow interface on a portion of your page.<\/p>\n<p>Once this plugin is installed and activated, use the Slider tab in your WordPress dashboard to assemble a group of slides with text, backgrounds and so on. You can then have the slides show up on any page of your site using the Total Slider widget.<\/p>\n<p>Go to <strong>Appearance<\/strong> &gt; <strong>Widgets<\/strong> in WordPress and drag a new Total Slider widget to the correct area. Then, simply select the slide group to show in this area of your site. You can also use the Total Slider shortcode to add a slider into a post or page by clicking the new button in the editor toolbar.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Available in<\/strong>: English, Fran\u00e7ais<\/p>\n<h4>Key links<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.totalslider.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TotalSlider.com<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.totalslider.com\/docs\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">User Docs<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/vanpattenmedia\/total-slider\/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Developer Docs<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/raw.github.com\/vanpattenmedia\/total-slider\/master\/license.txt\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">License<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Install Total Slider either by searching for it under <strong>Plugins<\/strong> &gt; <strong>Add New<\/strong> in your WordPress site dashboard, or download it here from the Plugin Directory, extract the zip file and upload the <strong>total-slider<\/strong> directory to <strong>wp-content\/plugins<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin on the <strong>Plugins<\/strong> page of your dashboard.<\/li>\n<li>Click <strong>Slider<\/strong> in the admin menu and get started on your first slide group!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>2.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes some uncommon issues that may cause slides to become orphaned during an upgrade.<\/li>\n<li>Fixes any slides that have become orphaned due to the issue above, re-connecting them to their slide groups.<\/li>\n<li>Fix for issue where a slide with a blank description would display the previous slide&#8217;s description (reported by <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/profile\/rleggett\" rel=\"ugc\">Rachel on WP.org Support Forums<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Major new release, featuring drafts, auto-saving drafts and improved behind-the-scenes data storage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes compatibility with WordPress 4.0.

I spend hours trying to fix the damn things and tidy up the mess they make, HOWEVER this plugin has been crafted beautifully well.  There has been a great deal of effort gone into the delivery of this slider.  The reason I have only given four stars, is the documentation sucks and the default styles provided are not responsive.  If it was not for these two points, I'd give this plugin a full five stars.
