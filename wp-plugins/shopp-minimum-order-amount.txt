Do you want to make sure your customers order a minimum amount of items, or spend a minimum amount of money? Then the Shopp Minimum Order plugin is what you need! It will prevent customers from checking out unless they meet the minimum order requirements set by the shop owner.<\/p>\n<p><em>This plugin requires you to be running at least Shopp 1.3<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve installed and activated the plugin, there will be a link in the Shopp &gt; Setup menu where you configure the minimum order values. Set the minimum type you want to use, enter a number, then hit Save and you\u2019re done!<\/p>\n<p>The plugin will now generate an error message during the Checkout process if the order does not meet the requirements you set. We highly recommend that you notify your customers (via a message on the Shopping Cart page for example) that you have a minimum order requirement, so they\u2019re not surprised when they try to check out.<\/p>\n<p><em>New Feature:<\/em> Version 1.3 supports per-product minimums!
