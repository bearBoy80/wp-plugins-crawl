Until now, there have been two options:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use Google search results, making the user feel like he\u2019s been escorted out of the building by burly security guards.<\/li>\n<li>Spend a few hours playing with the endless settings of search plugins that use fancy algorithms, but don\u2019t seem to do much other than slow down your site.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>But most of the time, you know exactly what information your users should be seeing for common searches. Curated Search gives you the tools to send users to the best content using the perfect algorithm &#8211; you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/nO75kPExREw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Specify a search term for which you would like to control the results, then use the following features to curate the content displayed to your visitors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pinned results: Want to make sure your 10k word article on vaporwave vs. chillwave shows up every time users search for \u201cseapunk\u201d? Pin it for the search term and make sure it\u2019s the first result they see.<\/li>\n<li>Synonyms: Create search term \u201csynonyms\u201d to show desired search results on less common terms or common misspellings. Make sure users see results for \u201csoda\u201d when they search for \u201cpop\u201d and people searching for \u201cresturaunt\u201d get the results for \u201crestaurant\u201d.<\/li>\n<li>Contextual search content: Build content in the standard WordPress WYSIWYG editor  and display it above the search results for specific terms. Want to provide a special download link for people searching for \u201cebooks\u201d, or coupon codes for people searching for \u201chandbags\u201d? No problem.<\/li>\n<li>Redirect specific search terms: If you have 1,000 articles about vinyl records on your site, a search for \u201cvinyl\u201d will be practically useless for the user. Send the user to a more useful page (landing page, topic center, archive, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Batch hide content: Don\u2019t want people seeing search results for certain parts of the site? Mark categories, tags, and custom taxonomies as off-limits to the site search with a handy wizard &#8211; no more tracking down category IDs.<\/li>\n<li>Hide individual pieces of content: A handy meta box on individual posts\/pages\/etc. lets you hide single items without having to assign them a custom tag or category.<\/li>\n<li>Limit total search results: Nobody is looking at page 6 of 15 in your site search. Ditch the overflow.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>curated-search<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>If you would like to display content from the WYSIWYG editor of a Special Search at the top of the search results page, paste <code>&lt;?php do_action('cs_search_after_title'); ?&gt;<\/code> into the search.php file of your theme below the header and above The Loop.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Do I have to modify my theme to use this?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The plugin will work without modifying your theme.

It is for modifying search results for specific queries that you choose.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Will this catch misspellings and direct them to the correct results?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not out of the box.
