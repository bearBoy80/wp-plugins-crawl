They are Phrase users but had not been using it for their corporate site, which is built on WordPress. Fortunately, they use the Gutenberg block editor, which is a requirement for this plugin.\n\nThe plugin currently only works with text content. It pulls the content from the website, with indicators of its context. The content can be delivered to translators while retaining its context. Once the translations are done and reviewed, they are exported back into a version of the WordPress site.\n\nWhile its functionality is somewhat limited, the plugin serves as a nifty tool for doing quick translations as core content is added and edited. WordPress is, technically, a content management system, and the plugin extends that capability to localisation management. Pretty cool, and the Phrase support was fast with answers, as I was in my initial learning curve. I\u2019m not overly technical so that was a big plus. \nThumbs up!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Improved our translation processes by a lot!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/windypops\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/2359b14770774a1d4521b49e20623415?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/2359b14770774a1d4521b49e20623415?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/windypops\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">windypops<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">January 6, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Having already worked with the Phrase (Phrase-app at the time) TMS before, I was very pleased to see this connector available for WP; which we\u00b4re currently using for a rollout across the EU, mainly translation of blogs and marketing content, in 11 languages. \nSince we\u00b4re using several freelancers for the content I pushed for this solution - you do need to invest some time to set up the process, which definitely paid off already: goodbye chaos! Also our productteam and content marketing guys are on speaking terms again so a clear win there ;-) \nI recommend Phrase if you really need to coordinate many translations and processes, and want a solid solution<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/phrase.1.2.5.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"languages":"languages","multilingual":"multilingual","translation":"translation"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/phrase.1.0.0.zip","1.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/phrase.1.1.0.zip","1.2.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/phrase.1.2.0.zip","1.2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/phrase.1.2.1.zip","1.2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/phrase.1.2.2.zip","1.2.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/phrase.1.2.3.zip","1.2.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/phrase.1.2.4.zip","1.2.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/phrase.1.2.5.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/phrase.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/phrase\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2789254","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/phrase\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2789254"}}
