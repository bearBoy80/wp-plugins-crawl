Replacement images can be clicked to reveal a &#8216;delete&#8217; button.<\/p>\n<p>This works extremely well when your shortcode already has a tinymce button, but does work for manual shortcodes too.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin does not support multi-line shortcodes or non-self-closing shortcodes (e.g. it supports <code>[foo bar=\"baz\"]<\/code> but not <code>[foo]bar baz[\/foo]<\/code>). Honestly, I don&#8217;t even know what would happen if you tried to use one. It may work, but it&#8217;s entirely unsupported.<\/p>\n<p>To add your shortcode, hook onto the filter <code>'jpb_visual_shortcodes'<\/code>. That filter will pass one array as an argument. Each element of that array is an associative array which must contain values for the following keys:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>shortcode<\/code> The name of the shortcode to replace<\/li>\n<li><code>image<\/code> The url of the image to replace the shortcode with.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Additionally, the array may contain the optional parameter <code>command<\/code>, which must be a valid tinymce command. If present, this value will trigger a second UI button (&#8216;Edit&#8217;) when the user clicks the replacement image which, when clicked, will execute the tinymce command passed as the value.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Really?
