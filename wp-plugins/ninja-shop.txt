I hope this changes but can't wait so I need to move to another solution.<\/strong>\n\n<strong>The Great:<\/strong>  The general way in which it works and is installed is quite good.  It looks nice and clean and simple to set up.  It is lighter than plugins like Woocommece and is easily in the top 2 or 3 smaller shop plugins for its purpose.  The admin interface is fairly easy to follow, and page generation is oddly not needed as it uses the store inbuilt pages (unless you want create and use your own pages).\n\nIt has 'features' or options might be a better word, which you can turn on and off, so only what you need is enabled.\n\nThe product image zoom feature is a real nice addition.  I have the popup setting off so the zoom is on the main product page image so it's a cleaner look and feel.\n\n<strong>The Good:<\/strong>  It is relatively easy to make css edits to make it look and feel as you want, but it does require good css knowledge.  This is where I have made this into being a really usable product.  Works for me ;)\n\nShipping works ok for Flat rate and free per product. However shipping needs a global shipping rate(s), like we may want to charge a flat $20 regardless of how many items are in their cart.\n\nAn option to calculate shipping would be a bonus.  In Australia we use Aust Post for most things and it is a weight versus size calculation.  Not sure how this could be integrated into it as I think it will get quite heavy to cover it all. \n\nThere is inventory, but I am yet to find where this can be displayed on the front end for clients to see, which is needed for limited edition items.  I'm still testing this part.\n\n<strong>The Not So Good:<\/strong> While you can add, change etc css styles, it is not for the new novice user which a lot of WP users fall into. It lacks in some basic style options that should by default be available in settings.  For example the number of columns in a row for products list as well as settings for responsive design that looks good out of the box without substantial css edits being required.  Basic colour styles would also be helpful for such things as buttons etc.  Sure this can be done in css if you are happy to get your hands dirty :).  It does tell you where to place the style sheet if you do not want to just add it to your themes (child) style sheet, aka keep them separate which is a nice feature.\n\n<strong>The \"needs more work\":<\/strong> The website offers no way to contact the author(s) and support on here looks limited at best, or maybe no one else is using it and hence so few support queries (or it is so good no one else needs support :) ).\n\nWhile some documentation exists it is by no means complete.  There are still issues and how to do items needed to be added, e.g. the above add columns.  The website has an 'Account' menu item that goes to a login but no registration.  Not sure what the purpose of that is for.\n\nIts feature list appears different to the documentation, for example no Stripe payment option.\n\nAs I said it has great potential, I hope it will continue to be further developed.\n\n--\n\nEDIT: The more I play with this and style it the more i like it :)\n\n<strong>PLEASE do not make this an \"expensive monthly\" product cost like Ninja Forms is.<\/strong>  Otherwise I better choose another option.  Happy to pay for a feature as needed ... but not at the high prices of Ninja Forms.\n\n<strong>Feature Requests:<\/strong>\n<ul> \n\t<li>Integrate with Elementor blocks. <\/li>\n\t<li>Be able to use a shortcode to add a product or products to a post or page (so each product has a shortcode).<\/li>\n\t<li>Global shipping cost setting<\/li>\n        <li>I am interested how the 'Membership' feature will be implemented, it would be awesome to have it integrated with something like Ultimate Member.<\/li>\n        <li>Australian Tax Rates (GST).<\/li>\n        <li>Template files to override shop templates in theme (child)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n... more to come I am sure<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Excited about the potential<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"4 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"4\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dorothy1508\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/4b831ad738242ece06fcd655796ff3f3?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/4b831ad738242ece06fcd655796ff3f3?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dorothy1508\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Thea <small>(dorothy1508)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 11, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I really like the setup of this plugin.

It's easy and logical to setup and to get started with.\n\nThere were some \"bugs\" within the coupon setting (the dice does not auto-generate) and there were not any conditional options (same problem as with WooCommerce) by which I mean that there are no \"if\" conditions that can be combined. Let me explain by example: 10% off your first purchase but only up to 15 dollar. So if you spend 200, you still only get 15 dollar discount, not 20. Things like that is missing from both this and from Woo.\n\nOther than that I love the fact that you can customize the user account page to your own liking, you can customize the order emails and so much more.\n\nThere is no pop-up when adding a product to cart which I personally like, the notification happens there and then -- directly by the button with a link to checkout and cart. Something Woo does not have but should.\n\nThis has potential to become bigger than Woo.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.1.11.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ninja-shop\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1944305","caption":"Quick Setup"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ninja-shop\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1944305","caption":"Add New Digital Product"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ninja-shop\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1944305","caption":"Add New Physical Product"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ninja-shop\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=1944305","caption":"Features"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ninja-shop\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=1944305","caption":"Customer Detail"},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ninja-shop\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=1944305","caption":"Dashboard Widget"},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ninja-shop\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=1944305","caption":"Payments"},"8":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ninja-shop\/assets\/screenshot-8.png?rev=1944305","caption":"Email Settings"},"9":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ninja-shop\/assets\/screenshot-9.png?rev=1944305","caption":"Custom Email Styling"},"10":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ninja-shop\/assets\/screenshot-10.png?rev=1944305","caption":"Pages Settings"}},"tags":{"e-commerce":"e-commerce","ecommerce":"ecommerce","sales":"sales","sell":"sell","store":"store"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.0.1.zip","1.1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.1.0.zip","1.1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.1.1.zip","1.1.10":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.1.10.zip","1.1.11":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.1.11.zip","1.1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.1.2.zip","1.1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.1.3.zip","1.1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.1.4.zip","1.1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.1.5.zip","1.1.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.1.6.zip","1.1.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.1.7.zip","1.1.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.1.8.zip","1.1.9":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.1.1.9.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ninja-shop.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ninja-shop\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1944305","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ninja-shop\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1944305"}}
