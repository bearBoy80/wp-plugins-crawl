This enables blog owners to create automatic aggregating, or topic specific blogs from any<br \/>\nnumber of different blog sources without relying on RSS feeds or any kind of timed events. Put simply: it re-posts<br \/>\nthe content of one blog to one or more other blogs.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin uses WordPress&#8217; built in XML-RPC functionality to push posts to the target blog. XML-RPC will need<br \/>\nto be enabled on the receiving blog in order for this plugin to work. For versions of WordPress 3.5 and later<br \/>\nthe XML-RPC is enabled by default. For versions prior to 3.5 it will need enabling in the admin panel.<\/p>\n<p>For versions 0.8 and higher of the plugin the sending blog needs to be WordPress 3.1 or higher due to the use of<br \/>\nthe WordPress enhanced IXR client, and the receiving blog needs to be WordPress 3.4 or higher so that the XML-RPC<br \/>\nWordPress API posts functionality is available.<\/p>\n<p>More information is available, feature requests and bug reports are gladly accepted over on the<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flutt.co.uk\/development\/wordpress-plugins\/syndicate-out\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">project&#8217;s own blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Set up a user on the receiving blog which has permissions to publish new posts<\/li>\n<li>For versions of WordPress before 3.5 only: switch on XML-RPC remote publishing on the receiving blog (&#8216;Settings&#8217;-&gt;&#8217;Writing&#8217;)<\/li>\n<li>Upload the syndicate-out directory to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory of the sending blog<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Configure the plugin through the &#8216;Settings&#8217;-&gt;&#8217;Syndication&#8217; menu<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You may then test the plugin by posting to the selected syndication category.<br \/>\nThe post should immediately be cross-posted to the remote blog.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.9<\/h4>\n<p>=<br \/>\n* Added syndication of featured images (d?ky Jan at lwd.cz for the majority of this).<br \/>\n* Added syndication of custom post types &amp; new filter &#8216;syndicate_out_post_types&#8217; (thanks Martin Burchell and Aptivate).<br \/>\n* Bug fix to prevent old custom meta data being transmitted (thanks again to Martin Burchell and Aptivate).<br \/>\n* Fix for API authentication failure when corrections are needed to remote site URL (thanks Brandon).<br \/>\n* Made some improvements to error reporting when API authentication fails.<br \/>\n* Added ability to rename syndication groups for greater clarity.<br \/>\n* Squelch error in new post page for groups with no servers.<br \/>\n* Made improvements to custom meta transmission to hopefully improve syndication of SEO etc. data.<\/p>\n<h4>0.8.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added hooks for actions and filters to syndication process.<\/li>\n<li>Added option to transmit all categories except for the syndication category.

I have 2 MultiSite installs.  100s of plugins to support several different types of sites.  Syndicate Out has no problem nor causes any issues.<\/p>\n<p>I had been using WP Cross Post for a long time.  No complaints.  Never any issues, until fairly recently.  Something in both of my MultiSites is causing issues for it.  The support is excellent.  There's too much to troubleshoot for me - and my host tech support.  My sites are knee deep in thick backend.  The plugin is great but Syndicate Out works flawlessly.  So, Syndicate Out is even greater!<\/p>\n<p>I like this plugin as it is!  Simple, different targets but one single function.  Selfishly I say, please don't make it \"feature rich\".  It is powerful, stable, without added complexities that I am not looking for with cross posting.  <\/p>\n<p>I agree that having a manual override would be nice.  But you can use the category filter for that.  <\/p>\n<p>The cross posts are complete, with images, reference and link back to my web site.  Perfect!<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for an excellent, robust, simple, plugin.  I appreciate your hard work.<br \/>\nCheers!\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.9.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"content":"content","cross-post":"cross post","post":"post","syndication":"syndication","xmlrpc":"xmlrpc"},"versions":{"0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.2.zip","0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.3.zip","0.3.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.3.1.zip","0.3.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.3.2.zip","0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.4.zip","0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.5.zip","0.5.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.5.1.zip","0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.6.zip","0.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.7.zip","0.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.8.zip","0.8.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.8.2.zip","0.8.2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.8.2.1.zip","0.8.2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.8.2.2.zip","0.8.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.8.3.zip","0.8.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.8.4.zip","0.9":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.0.9.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/syndicate-out.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
