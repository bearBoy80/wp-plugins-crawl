In order to post comments, users will have to write down<br \/>\nthe characters that are part of an image. Since it is relatively hard for<br \/>\nautomated programs to figure out those characters, this will help prevent<br \/>\ncomment spam from those programs.<\/p>\n<h4>Requirements<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 1.5 or higher.<\/li>\n<li>PHP 4.1.0 or higher with GD2 library support.<\/li>\n<li>Theme must support the &#8216;comment_form&#8217; action.<\/li>\n<li>PHP sessions enabled and properly configured.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In case you are wondering, most hosting providers should have those basic<br \/>\nrequirements in place.<\/p>\n<h4>Strengths vs other solutions<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to install<\/li>\n<li>Does not require Javascript to work<\/li>\n<li>Broad WordPress version support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Thanks<\/h3>\n<p>Thanks to Kruglov Sergei for creating KCAPTCHA, his pretty good CAPTCHA. You<br \/>\ncan visit KCAPTCHA website <a href=\"http:\/\/www.captcha.ru\/en\/kcaptcha\/\" title=\"KCAPTCHA\nwebsite\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>To install the plugin, you must first copy the directory yacaptcha in your<br \/>\nWordPress plugin directory which must be \/wp-content\/plugins\/. If you are using<br \/>\nWordpress 2.7 or higher, you can simply use the plugin installer in your<br \/>\nsite admin section, search for yaCAPTCHA and click on install or upload the zip<br \/>\nfile.<\/li>\n<li>After the installation, you need to go in your site admin, in the Plugins<br \/>\nsection and activate the yaCAPTCHA plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It should works flawlessly with the default theme.<\/p>\n<h4>Optional intallation steps<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For WordPress version lower than 3.0, the default theme and most themes<br \/>\nplace the additionnal comment form items after the submit button. I suggest you<br \/>\nchange it so that it appears before the submit button. Have a look at the<br \/>\n&#8220;How can I customize it?&#8221; section in the FAQ. This is not necessary if you are<br \/>\nusing version 3.0 or a higher version of WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>The default WordPress settings regarding comment appearance should be tweaked<br \/>\nwith this plugin. I suggest you uncheck these two options: &#8220;An administrator<br \/>\nmust always approve the comment&#8221; and &#8220;Comment author must have a previously<br \/>\napproved comment&#8221; in the Discussion Settings, &#8220;Before a comment appears&#8221; area.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","faq":"\n<h4>How can I customize it?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>For WordPress version lower than 3.0, you can change the location of the<br \/>\nCAPTCHA field within the comment form by changing the location of the<br \/>\n&#8216;comment_form&#8217; call in your theme&#8217;s comments.php file. The CAPTCHA field<br \/>\nappears at the same location as the &#8216;comment_form&#8217; call. The default location<br \/>\nfor the &#8216;comment_form&#8217; call can make it confusing for some people because the<br \/>\nCAPTCHA will appear after the submit button. I suggest you change it so that it<br \/>\nappears before the submit button. This is not necessary if you are using<br \/>\nversion 3.0 or a higher version of WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>You can customize the messages that are shown by changing the content of<br \/>\n$yaCaptchaCharInputMsg, $yaCaptchaCharNoMatchMsg and<br \/>\n$yaCaptchaCharAlternateCaptchaText in the yacaptcha.php file. The default<br \/>\nmessages should be good enough for most English blogs.<\/p>\n<p>You can customize the HTML code that is used in the comment section to match<br \/>\nyour theme preferences by changing the code in the yaCaptchaCommentForm<br \/>\nfunction for WordPress version lower than 3.0 and in the<br \/>\nyaCaptchaCommentFormAfterFields function for WordPress version 3.0 or higher in<br \/>\nthe yacaptcha.php file. The default HTML code match the default WordPress<br \/>\ntheme.<\/p>\n<p>You can customize the image properties like how many characters are shown or<br \/>\nwhich characters are used by changing values in the kcaptcha_config.php<br \/>\nfile. The default values should be good enough for most people.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I cannot see the CAPTCHA when I am logged in<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The CAPTCHA is not shown and it is not validated for logged in users. It<br \/>\nassumes that logged in users are already validated and they will not post<br \/>\nspam.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>It does not work!<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, make sure that you meet all the requirements. If you are still<br \/>\nhaving problems, you can contact me.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.5<\/h4>\n<p>(July 11th, 2010): Updated to work with WordPress 3.0 and the default theme.<br \/>\nPlugin documentation update.
