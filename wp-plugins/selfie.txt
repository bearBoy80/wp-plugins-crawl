I say this as when I tried it and then went back, it stayed in the same box area place where you put your details and no way to get back out, the only way was to refresh. Could you also make it possible to change the $ to any other currency ie in my situation it would be the Pound.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks :)\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/selfie.0.2.2.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/selfie\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=914312","caption":"<strong>Selfie in a Post<\/strong> - This is selfie being rendered in a post.
