You always have all of your comments so uninstalling is a one-click process if you change your mind. Syncing your accounts enables auto-login so logging into WordPress automatically logs you into IntenseDebate.

Readers with JS disabled can comment in the original WP system and those comments will be imported into IntenseDebate.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20sync%20my%20accounts%3F'>\nHow do I sync my accounts?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>After installing and activating the IntenseDebate plugin you will need to update your account settings in your Plugin Settings page and either create an IntenseDebate account or login to your IntenseDebate account.
