Adds a shortcode: <code>[rating=5]<\/code>, which allow you to insert a movie or book rating (a four star rating looks like this: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;)<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin to your wp-content\/plugins directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you want to, you can replace the unicode symbols with images using only CSS (<a href=\"http:\/\/noscope.com\/n\/8\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a button in both the visual and HTML editor to easily insert the tag. There&#8217;s also an options page which, among other things, allows you to replace the default star character with any other unicode character, for instance, a &hearts;.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<ul>\n<li>1.0: First release<\/li>\n<li>1.1: Made sure &#8220;empty&#8221; stars didn&#8217;t show up in feeds, where the CSS would make it look as though they were black like the &#8220;full&#8221; stars, hence indicationg a 6 star rating always. Also fixed a problem with the default symbol not working.<\/li>\n<li>1.2: Added shorter syntax.<\/li>\n<li>1.2.5: Wrapped the rating in &#8220;wpautop&#8221; to ensure it flows properly in your content.<\/li>\n<li>1.5: New feature: [relatedratings=x] shows y other posts containing a rating of x stars. Also added buttons in both the visual and HTML editor for inserting such ratings.<\/li>\n<li>1.5.2: Tweaked relatedratings to filter out post revisions. Let me know if it doesn&#8217;t work. Also made it the plugin translatable. Also renamed the plugin to better indicate what the plugin does. <\/li>\n<li>1.5.3: Small, not so elegant fix (for the moment, the button hover text may be untranslatable), which makes the adds 3.1 compatability.<\/li>\n<li>1.6: Removed the &#8220;relatedratings&#8221; shortcode, I never got it to work properly performance wasn&#8217;t great.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ratings-shorttags\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1538903\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ratings-shorttags\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1538903\" alt=\"This is a rating inserted using the shorttag.\"><\/a><p>This is a rating inserted using the shorttag.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ratings-shorttags.1.6.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ratings-shorttags\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1538903","caption":"This is a rating inserted using the shorttag."}},"tags":{"movies":"movies","rating":"rating","reviews":"reviews","shortcodes":"shortcodes","stars":"stars"},"versions":{"1.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ratings-shorttags.1.6.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/ratings-shorttags.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
