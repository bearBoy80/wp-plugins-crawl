Proper use of structured data <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/guides\/intro-structured-data\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">enables third-parties like Google to parse reviews, event data, and contact information in meaningful ways<\/a>, ensuring you&#8217;re getting the most &#8220;bang&#8221; out of your publishing buck.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, the major players in the Search game, including Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, and Yandex) came together in the early 2010s to form <a href=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/docs\/about.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Schema.org<\/a>, a collaborative, community-driven standard for structured data.<\/p>\n<p>With the major search engines and communities behind it, we&#8217;re all marking up everything with appropriate structured data now, right?<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the process of implementing Schema.org in a site \u2014 especially one driven by dynamic content \u2014\u00a0is less than straightforward. <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress<\/a>, for instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/ma.tt\/2015\/11\/seventy-five-to-go\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">powers roughly a quarter of the web<\/a>, but implementing structured data across hundreds of thousands of themes would be a nightmare.<\/p>\n<p>Or, at least it would be, if it weren&#8217;t for Schemify.<\/p>\n<h4>What does Schemify do?<\/h4>\n<p>There are two approaches to adding structured data to a website: via the markup or <a href=\"http:\/\/json-ld.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">JSON for Linking Data (JSON-LD)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Consider the following author information, which might appear at the bottom of a blog post:<\/p>\n<pre><code>    \n        \n        <a href=\"https:\/\/stevegrunwell.com\" rel=\"author nofollow ugc\">Steve Grunwell<\/a>\n        <p>Steve is the Director of Technology at Growella. When he's not working, you can find him speaking at conferences, roasting coffee, or spending time with his wife and daughter<\/p>\n    \n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>If I wanted this information to use Schema.org markup, it would look something like this:<\/p>\n<pre><code>    \n        \n        <a href=\"https:\/\/stevegrunwell.com\" rel=\"author nofollow ugc\">Steve Grunwell<\/a>\n        <p>Steve is the Director of Technology at Growella. When he's not working, you can find him speaking at conferences, roasting coffee, or spending time with his wife and daughter<\/p>\n    \n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>While that may not <em>seem<\/em> like a lot of work, that&#8217;s still a lot of extra markup being added. Even worse, a lot of that markup might normally be generated by WordPress helper functions like <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/get_avatar\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><code>get_avatar()<\/code><\/a>, which means extra work to get the necessary <code>itemprop<\/code> attribute in place.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, the other approach for adding structured data is much more straight-forward in a theme, as it&#8217;s simply a JSON-LD object:<\/p>\n<pre><code>    \n    {\n        \"@context\": \"http:\/\/schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Person\",\n        \"name\": \"Steve Grunwell\",\n        \"url\": \"https:\/\/stevegrunwell.com\",\n        \"image\": \"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/88ea4e10ed968136228545d7112d82cb?s=200\",\n        \"description\": \"Steve is the Director of Technology at Growella. When he's not working, you can find him speaking at conferences, roasting coffee, or spending time with his wife and daughter\"\n    }\n    \n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>We simply generate this JSON-LD object and append it to our document&#8217;s <code>&lt;body&gt;<\/code>. When Google or anyone else who supports JSON-LD structured data parses our page, they can immediately understand that Steve Grunwell is a person and determine his website, avatar, and biography.<\/p>\n<p>The best part? There&#8217;s no need to change the markup within our theme!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Schemify aims to automate the generation of JSON-LD objects for content within WordPress.<\/strong> Its flexible structure and reasonable defaults enables drop-in support for structured data, regardless of the WordPress theme.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>After uploading Schemify to your WordPress instance, activate it via the Plugins screen in wp-admin.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial public release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">As advertised<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/philhoyt\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b42937eec01cd4ede8eae507f80f8724?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b42937eec01cd4ede8eae507f80f8724?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/philhoyt\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">philhoyt<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">June 29, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Adding schema to a site no longer has to be an afterthought.
