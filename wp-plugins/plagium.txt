We have aimed to provide an easy to use service that applies to a broad base of users.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why not submit the text query to Google, Yahoo, or other well established search engines?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can submit limited text queries to Google, Yahoo, and other search engines. These tools are excellent for searching single terms and expressions, and we encourage you to try this with a large block of text. However, when large text blocks are submitted you will notice some big differences between how these search engines operate and the results obtained from Plagium:<br \/>\nGoogle and the other search engines limit the number of terms that you can enter into the query, typically on the order of 10 to a few dozen terms. However, Plagium can accept much larger blocks of text (and we are working to make the text size even bigger). Therefore, all of your content is evaluated, not just the words at the beginning of your document.<br \/>\nPlagium makes use of a proprietary technique that intelligently breaks up the input text into smaller &#8220;snippets&#8221;. These snippets are matched against Web content in an efficient manner, with the matches scored to determine what documents match the input text. The result is a much cleaner view of possible matching documents &#8211; a view that is much less noisy than the results offered by the major search engines.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can Plagium tell me if somebody plagiarized my text?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The answer is NO. Plagium only returns links to documents containing text blocks that match what you have presented to Plagium. Such results could imply unauthorized, copied use of your text but we cannot be the judge of that. Plagium cannot ascertain the authority or legitimacy of the documents that it retrieves. We strongly suggest that you seek legal counsel for the course of appropriate corrective action if you believe that somebody or an organization is using, without proper authorization, text that you created.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug corrections<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug corrections<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Global admin options<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Satinizing input<\/li>\n<li>Remove iframe<\/li>\n<li>Integration with Plagium Ajax API<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/plagium\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1173100\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/plagium\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1173100\" alt=\"post page integration with Plagium\"><\/a><p>post page integration with Plagium<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/plagium\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1173132\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/plagium\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1173132\" alt=\"configuration page\"><\/a><p>configuration page<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">so-so.. not worth your attention<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/spookee\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/83740b57d0a0458a211ec78865e6b9fc?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/83740b57d0a0458a211ec78865e6b9fc?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/spookee\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">spookee<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>so-so.. not worth your attention.
