You can use it to show any point on the map; where you work, where your idol lives or even where you want to go on holiday. The plugin works both as a widget or as a stand-alone component you can add to your sidebar.<\/p>\n<p>Most information at: http:\/\/www.u-g-h.com\/index.php\/wordpress-plugins\/wordpress-plugin-geowidget\/<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Download the plugin file, unzip and place it in your plugin folder.<br \/>\nThis makes the plugin available to WordPress and it should now appear in your Plugin folder. The zip file contains all the files you need. Please make sure all files end up in the ?GeoWidget? directory.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate the plugin<br \/>\nThis ?starts up? the plugin, making it available to your presentation files (you know, the ones that make up your theme). At this point, the plugin is active, but WordPress doesn?t know where it should be displaying GeoWidget.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>3a. Add this snippet to your theme: <code>&lt;?php GeoWidget(); ?&gt;<\/code><br \/>\nThis tells WordPress where to put the map. Place the snippet in the sidebar where you want the map to appear.<\/p>\n<p>3b. Alternatively, the plugin is also widget-aware and will appear in your widget list.<br \/>\nGo to your widget screen and drag the GeoWidget to the place you want it to appear on your sidebar.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Configure the plugin<br \/>\nThe plugin can be configured both from the widget control area as well as from a new panel in the Options menu. The widget control area lets you key in the details you want, but you?ll need to know the Longitude and Latitude of the point your want to show. If you go to the Options screen, you?ll have an option which pops up a map and lets you search for the point you want to display. (It?s cool, try it out)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>What&#8217;s the best bloggin engine in the world?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress of course!.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/geowidget.1.0.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"geo":"geo","mapping":"mapping","sidebar":"sidebar","widget":"widget"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/geowidget.1.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/geowidget.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.u-g-h.com","banners":[]}
