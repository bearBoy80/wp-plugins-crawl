This plugin is thus a very opinionated one. The button selection is done with reusable content in mind. All buttons that would results in harmful markup are removed.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin also removes the kitchen sink button. Instead, there is an icon with three dots. Pressing that expands the row to contain all the available buttons. This works better with a responsive page than hard coded lines of buttons which in some widths break into four separate lines.<\/p>\n<p>A detailed description of design decisions can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/akibjorklund.com\/2015\/editor-buttons-simplified\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on my blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>plugin-name.php<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.2.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bump version to test if helps with the compatibility (Tested up to) header.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.2.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add support for WordPress 4.7 which does some changes to the toolbar.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Get rid of separate rows of buttons, since they do not work well with a responsive layout.
