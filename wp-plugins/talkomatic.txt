It is different from most chat<br \/>\nrooms in that each participant has their own little section of the screen to type into,<br \/>\nand you see what other people are typing letter-by-letter, as they type it, so the experience<br \/>\nis more immediate. Talkomatic runs on its own server at http:\/\/talko.cc.<\/p>\n<p>The Talkomatic plugin lets you embed a Talkomatic chat room in a page or post on your own<br \/>\nWordPress site, using a simple shortcode. The chat room appears on your page within an iframe.<\/p>\n<p>If the shortcode specifies a room name, any user who navigates to the page where<br \/>\nthis shortcode is included will automatically enter the named chat room. If no<br \/>\nroom name is specified, the user will enter the Talkomatic lobby, which displays<br \/>\na list of active rooms and participants and allows the user to choose an existing<br \/>\nroom or open a new room, which may be public or private.<\/p>\n<p>If the named room is not already open, it will be opened automatically as a public room.<br \/>\nIf the named room is already open and is public, the user will enter the room if there is<br \/>\nan open slot. (There is a maximum of five participants per room.) If the room is open as<br \/>\na private room, the user will be required to type the room key before being allowed in.<br \/>\nThe room key is defined by whoever opens the room and designates it as private.<\/p>\n<p>Talkomatic chat rooms do not place any burden on your WordPress server because they<br \/>\nare hosted on the independent server at http:\/\/talko.cc. For more information about<br \/>\nTalkomatic, see http:\/\/talko.cc\/about.html<\/p>\n<p>Using the Talkomatic shortcode &#8211; Examples:<\/p>\n<pre><code>Put user into a specific named room, with default iframe dimensions (900 x 850 pixels):\n    [talkomatic room=\"Elbow Room\"]\n\nPut user into a specific named room, with custom iframe dimensions:\n    [talkomatic room=\"Broom Closet\" width=600 height=800]\n\nPut user into the Talkomatic lobby, where they can choose a room or open a new one:\n    [talkomatic]\n\nPut user into the Talkomatic lobby, with custom iframe dimensions:\n    [talkomatic width=650 height=900]\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>WordPress Version Compatibility<\/h3>\n<p>Regardless of what the &#8220;Compatible up to&#8221; line says, this plugin should be compatible with all<br \/>\nfuture versions of WordPress forever. You can count on it because this plugin simply outputs<br \/>\nsome HTML text and does not interface to any part of the WordPress core. It could only become<br \/>\nincompatible if WordPress changes the basics of how shortcodes are defined and called, which is<br \/>\nextremely unlikely since that would break thousands of plugins, and WordPress has a strong<br \/>\ncommitment to backward compatibility.<\/p>\n<h3>Requirements<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP 4+<\/li>\n<li>WordPress 3.0+<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Download and unzip the latest release zip file<\/li>\n<li>Upload the entire directory to your <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"<p>See http:\/\/talko.cc\/about.html<\/p>\n","changelog":"<ul>\n<li>1.0.0 &#8211; 2015-10-01 &#8211; Initial release version<\/li>\n<li>1.1.0 &#8211; 2015-11-14 &#8211; Simplify the invitation URL shown in the room footer, and tweak documentation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/talkomatic\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1258571\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/talkomatic\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1258571\" alt=\"Sample of a Talkomatic chat room with four participants\"><\/a><p>Sample of a Talkomatic chat room with four participants<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">talkomatic<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dougwbrown\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/620874cd23d414ec95cb3b29d09574f8?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/620874cd23d414ec95cb3b29d09574f8?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dougwbrown\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">dougwbrown<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>I like the doorbell.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/talkomatic.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/talkomatic\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1258571","caption":"Sample of a Talkomatic chat room with four participants"}},"tags":{"chat":"chat","chat-rooms":"chat rooms","free-chat":"free chat","live-chat":"live chat","text-chat":"text chat"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=QUY524EZ9D5AA","banners":[]}
