For a long time I\u2019ve been meaning to write blog posts for all of the books that I\u2019ve read recently but found that I got lost when it came time to begin the process. So I created a plugin that makes it easy to keep track! Basically, it\u2019s a good-looking way to write about the books you\u2019ve read and display them on your website. I utilize some basic prompts to help you extract the meaningful parts of the book and the plugin then creates a blog post entry from this information. Presently the prompts are:<br \/>\n-Date Finished<br \/>\n-Book Summary<br \/>\n-What Did You Learn from the Book?<br \/>\n-Any Final Thoughts?<\/p>\n<p>If you have any recommendations for other prompts to use please let me know at <code>me@trevorelwell.com<\/code> and I\u2019d be happy to consider them!<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Installation of Books You\u2019ve Read is simple. The shortcode utilized is <code>[byr_show_all_books]<\/code> which you can put onto any of your pages or posts.

I recommend using a high-quality image of the cover of the book but you can be as creative as you\u2019d like.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<p>-First released version of the Books You\u2019ve Read plugin<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/books-youve-read\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1280645\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/books-youve-read\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1280645\" alt=\"Rendered version of the &lt;code&gt;[byr_show_all_books]&lt;\/code&gt; shortcode\"><\/a><p>Rendered version of the <code>[byr_show_all_books]<\/code> shortcode<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/books-youve-read\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1280645\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/books-youve-read\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1280645\" alt=\"View of the &lt;code&gt;Books Read&lt;\/code&gt; blog post type and where\/how it\u2019s displayed on your WordPress installation\"><\/a><p>View of the <code>Books Read<\/code> blog post type and where\/how it\u2019s displayed on your WordPress installation<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/books-youve-read\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1280645\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/books-youve-read\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1280645\" alt=\"View of the prompts on the &lt;code&gt;Books Read&lt;\/code&gt; blog post type under &lt;code&gt;Add New&lt;\/code&gt;\"><\/a><p>View of the prompts on the <code>Books Read<\/code> blog post type under <code>Add New<\/code><\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/books-youve-read.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/books-youve-read\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1280645","caption":"Rendered version of the <code>[byr_show_all_books]<\/code> shortcode"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/books-youve-read\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1280645","caption":"View of the <code>Books Read<\/code> blog post type and where\/how it\u2019s displayed on your WordPress installation"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/books-youve-read\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1280645","caption":"View of the prompts on the <code>Books Read<\/code> blog post type under <code>Add New<\/code>"}},"tags":{"books":"books","books-youve-read":"books you\u2019ve read","reading":"reading"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"http:\/\/trevorelwell.me","banners":[]}
