Furthermore, if your Express-Install-enabled SWF is not at least that size, the Express Install function will automatically fail.<\/p>\n<p>It may also be a good idea to only place one SWF with Express Install functionality on each page. This way users won\u2019t be greeted with multiple upgrade dialog boxes and be forced to choose one.  Onto the specifics:<\/p>\n<h4>Specifics<\/h4>\n<p>Define the minimum flash player version required by your .SWF using the fversion attribute:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>fversion=\"9.0.115\"<\/code><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Add the useexpressinstall attribute to your <code>[kml_flashembed \/]<\/code> tag, like this:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>useexpressinstall=\"true\"<\/code><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the end, your KFE tag should look something like this:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>[kml_flashembed movie=\"filename.swf\" height=\"300\" width=\"300\" fversion=\"9\" useexpressinstall=\"true\"  \/]<\/code><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>That is all you need in order to invoke the Express Install functionality.  In the case of the above KFE tag, if a user arrives at your site with either a Flash Player 6, 7, or 8 installed, they will be alerted that they need a more recent version of the Flash Player and be given the option to upgrade it without leaving your site.<\/p>\n<h3>Defining Alternate Content for a Flash Movie<\/h3>\n<p>As of KFE 2.0, it is now <em>much<\/em> easier to specify alternative content which gets displayed when your Flash doesn&#8217;t get rendered. This could happen if a user doesn&#8217;t have a recent enough Flash player installed or lacks the Flash player altogether, such as on an iPhone. Another reason to specify alternative content is for search engine optimization, or SEO. Most search engines aren&#8217;t very good at indexing content in Flash movies, if they can do it at all (Google can, but only with content that has been hard coded into a SWF&#8211;dynamic content in a SWF doesn&#8217;t get indexed). In these cases it&#8217;s best to specify some alternative content for your SWF.<\/p>\n<p>To define alternative content for a SWF, you can now nest arbitrary HTML inside a KFE tag and it will be treated as alternate content for that SWF. The Tag Generator does this for you automatically. Properly nested alternative content looks like this:<\/p>\n<pre><code>[kml_flashembed movie=\"\/my\/great\/movie.swf\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"]\n\n    &lt;!-- Begin Alternate Content --&gt;\n\n    &lt;p&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/adobe.com\/go\/getflashplayer\"&gt;\n            &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/images\/shared\/download_buttons\/get_flash_player.gif\" alt=\"Get Adobe Flash player\" \/&gt;\n        &lt;\/a&gt;\n    &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- End Alternate Content --&gt;\n\n[\/kml_flashembed]&lt;h3&gt;Configuration Options&lt;\/h3&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>KFE 2.1 features configuration options which allow you to customize how the plugin behaves as well as set all defaults for the Tag Generator and KFE tags that omit some parameters. In WordPress, you can find the options by navigating to <em>Settings &rarr; Kimili Flash Embed<\/em>. Unless otherwise noted, the default tag generator values will be blank or unselected. You&#8217;ll find the following options available to you:<\/p>\n<h4>SWFObject Configuration Defaults<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Publish Method<\/strong><br \/>\nSpecifies the default <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/swfobject\/wiki\/documentation#Should_I_use_the_static_or_dynamic_publishing_method?\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">publishing method<\/a> for your SWF. If you omit this attribute from a KFE tag, whatever value you have set here will be applied to the tag. Default is <em>static<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Flash Version<\/strong><br \/>\nSpecifies the default Flash player version (Major.Minor.Release format) required to display your SWFs. If you omit this attribute from a KFE tag, whatever value you have set here will be applied to the tag. Default is <em>8.0.0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Adobe Express Install<\/strong><br \/>\nSpecifies whether or not you want to use Express Install functionality in your SWFs for users who don&#8217;t have the minimum version of the Flash Player you&#8217;ve defined installed. Default is <em>yes<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h4>SWF Definition Defaults<\/h4>\n<p><strong>SWF Filename<\/strong><br \/>\nThis is the default SWF filename which is populated in the <strong>Flash (.swf)<\/strong> field in the Tag Generator. This is especially useful if you use a common player to play FLVs, for instance. You can specify a URL with an absolute file path (i.e. @\/flies\/flash\/player.swf@). Default is <em>untitled.swf<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dimensions (width&times;height)<\/strong><br \/>\nSpecifies the default width and height for your SWFs. If you omit either of these attributes from a KFE tag, whatever value you have set here will be applied to the tag. Default is <em>400&times;300<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Attributes<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Flash Content ID<\/strong><br \/>\nThis is the CSS class name applied to your rendered Flash movies. This uniquely identifies the Flash movie so that it can be referenced using a scripting language or by CSS.<\/p>\n<p><strong>class<\/strong><br \/>\nThis is the CSS class name applied to your rendered Flash movies. If you omit this attribute from a KFE tag, whatever value you have set here will be applied to the tag. Default is <em>flashmovie<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>align<\/strong><br \/>\nHTML alignment of the object element. If this attribute is omitted, it by default centers the movie and crops edges if the browser window is smaller than the movie. NOTE: Using this attribute is not valid in XHTML 1.0 Strict.<\/p>\n<h4>Parameters<\/h4>\n<p><strong>play<\/strong><br \/>\nSpecifies whether the movie begins playing immediately on loading in the browser.

The default value is true if this attribute is omitted.<\/p>\n<p><strong>menu<\/strong><br \/>\nShows a shortcut menu when users right-click (Windows) or control-click (Macintosh) the SWF file. To show only About Flash in the shortcut menu, deselect this option. By default, this option is set to true.<\/p>\n<p><strong>quality<\/strong><br \/>\nSpecifies the trade-off between processing time and appearance. The default value is &#8216;high&#8217; if this attribute is omitted.<\/p>\n<p><strong>scale<\/strong><br \/>\nSpecifies scaling, aspect ratio, borders, distortion and cropping for if you have changed the document&#8217;s original width and height.<\/p>\n<p><strong>salign<\/strong><br \/>\nSpecifies where the content is placed within the application window and how it is cropped.<\/p>\n<p><strong>wmode<\/strong><br \/>\nSets the Window Mode property of the Flash movie for transparency, layering, and positioning in the browser. The default value is &#8216;window&#8217; if this attribute is omitted.<\/p>\n<p><strong>bgcolor<\/strong><br \/>\nHexadecimal RGB value in the format #RRGGBB, which specifies the background color of the movie, which will override the background color setting specified in the Flash file.<\/p>\n<p><strong>devicefont<\/strong><br \/>\nSpecifies whether static text objects that the Device Font option has not been selected for will be drawn using device fonts anyway, if the necessary fonts are available from the operating system.<\/p>\n<p><strong>seamlesstabbing<\/strong><br \/>\nSpecifies whether users are allowed to use the Tab key to move keyboard focus out of a Flash movie and into the surrounding HTML (or the browser, if there is nothing focusable in the HTML following the Flash movie). The default value is true if this attribute is omitted.<\/p>\n<p><strong>allowfullscreen<\/strong><br \/>\nEnables full-screen mode. The default value is false if this attribute is omitted. You must have version 9.0.28.0 or greater of Flash Player installed to use full-screen mode.<\/p>\n<p><strong>allowfullscreeninteractive<\/strong><br \/>\nEnables full-screen interactive mode, in which content running in Flash Player can fill the entire screen <em>and accept text input<\/em>. The default value is false if this attribute is omitted. You must have version 11.3.0 or greater of Flash Player installed to use full-screen interactive mode.

If omitted, the default value is &#8220;sameDomain&#8221; in most situations, except if the user&#8217;s Flash Player version is lower than 9.0.115.0 and the Flash movie is published for FP7 or earlier. In that case, the default will be &#8220;always&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>allownetworking<\/strong><br \/>\nControls a SWF file&#8217;s access to network functionality. The default value is &#8216;all&#8217; if this attribute is omitted.<\/p>\n<p><strong>base<\/strong><br \/>\nSpecifies the base directory or URL used to resolve all relative path statements in the Flash Player movie. This attribute is helpful when your Flash Player movies are kept in a different directory from your other files.<\/p>\n<p><strong>fvars<\/strong><br \/>\nAllows you to pass variables to a Flash movie. You need to separate individual name\/variable pairs with a semicolon (i.e. name=John Doe ; count=3).<\/p>\n<h4>Alternative Content Default<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Alternate Content<\/strong><br \/>\nSpecifies the default &#8220;alternative content&#8221;:#altContent to display when your SWF isn&#8217;t rendered. Default is a &#8220;Get Flash Player&#8221; badge linked to Adobe&#8217;s Flash Player download page, rendered as follows:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/adobe.com\/go\/getflashplayer\"&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/images\/shared\/download_buttons\/get_flash_player.gif\" alt=\"Get Adobe Flash player\" \/&gt;\n    &lt;\/a&gt;\n&lt;\/p&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<h4>Javascript Options<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Create a reference to SWFObject.js?<\/strong><br \/>\nDecide whether or not you want to create a reference to SWFObject 2.1 in the HTML of your page templates. It is useful to turn this off if you already have SWFObject being referenced elsewhere in your code. Note that SWFObject 2.x is NOT compatible with SWFObject 1.x! <em>KFE 2 requires SWFObject 2.x<\/em>. Default is <em>true<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you want to reference SWFObject.js from?<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you choose to create a reference to SWFObject 2.1, you have 2 options in terms of where you reference it from. <strong>Internal<\/strong> creates a link to the copy of SWFObject bundled with the plugin. <strong>Google Ajax Library<\/strong> creates a link to the copy of SWFObject hosted in the <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/swfobject\/wiki\/hosted_library\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google&#8217;s Hosted Ajax Library<\/a>. The advantage of this is that the Javascript gets served with correct cache headers and it saves you a bit of bandwidth on your server. Default is <em>Google Ajax Library<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you want to use SWFObject&#8217;s autohide functionality?<\/strong><br \/>\nBy default, SWFObject temporarily hides your SWF or alternative content until the library has decided which content to display. This option allows you to disable that behavior.<\/p>\n<h3>Backwards Compatibility Gotchas<\/h3>\n<p>KFE 2.0 is <em>mostly<\/em> backwards compatible with KFE 1.x, so if you&#8217;ve been using the 1.x version and just creating basic KFE tags, you should be able to upgrade with no issues whatsoever. There are, however, some attributes which were available in 1.x which are no longer available in 2.0. This is due primarily to changes in SWFObject itself when it went to 2.0, unless otherwise noted. The 1.x attributes which are no longer supported are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>detectkey<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>noscript<\/code> &#8211; This is now handled by defining alternate content properly.<\/li>\n<li><code>redirecturl<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>xiredirecturl<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>One other minor backwards compatibility issue for you has to do with the format of KFE tags. In very early versions of this plugin, you defined KFE tags using angle brackets &#8211; <code>&lt;kml_flashembed ... \/&gt;<\/code>. When problems arose with using angle bracket tags in WordPress&#8217; Rich Text Editor, I introduced the familiar square bracket variety &#8211; <code>[kml_flashembed ... \/]<\/code>. Up to and including KFE 1.4.3, both versions of the tag formatting were supported. However, in order to simplify things in the KFE 2.0 code, the old angle bracket tags are no longer supported. If you have any posts which use the old formatting, you&#8217;ll have to go back and update them to square brackets in order to continue rendering those Flash movies correctly.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Installing the plugin is as easy as unzipping and uploading the entire kimili-flash-embed folder into your \/wp-content\/plugins directory and activating the plugin.

You can deactivate and delete any old versions of KFE you may have.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I put a Flash Movie in my header. It works on the home page, but not on any other pages. Why?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you embed a SWF on an HTML page, you have to make sure that you use an <strong>absolute<\/strong> path to reference your SWF, not a relative one. The reason for this is that the browser looks for the SWF <em>relative to a page&#8217;s URL<\/em>. Therefore, by using an absolute path, you&#8217;ll ensure that the browser always looks for the SWF in the same place, regardless of what the page&#8217;s URL may be. The difference looks like this:<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Relative Path _incorrect_<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>[kml_flashembed movie=&#8221;myMovie.swf&#8221; height=&#8221;100&#8243; width=&#8221;800&#8243; \/]<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Absolute Path _correct_<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>[kml_flashembed movie=&#8221;\/path\/to\/myMovie.swf&#8221; height=&#8221;100&#8243; width=&#8221;800&#8243; \/]<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, the main difference is that your path begin with a <code>\/<\/code>, and then the path to your SWF. This tells the browser to start at the root of your site and find your SWF from there. Note that the absolute path need not include your site&#8217;s URL&#8212;it&#8217;s probably best if it <em>doesn&#8217;t<\/em> include it, as it&#8217;s more portable if your URL were to change.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m using SlideShowPro (_or a similar slideshow tool_). It works fine if I open the SWF directly in a browser, but on my site, it doesn&#8217;t display any content. What gives?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>SlideShowPro reads an XML file which tells it where to find the images to display. If it doesn&#8217;t find that XML, it won&#8217;t display anything. Typically, the XML file is in the same directory as the slideshow SWF, and the slideshow SWF will look for that XML using a relative path. This is fine if you access the SWF directly in the browser, but as I explain in the previous question, once you embed that SWF in an HTML page, the SWF resolves paths relative to that HTML page, <em>not relative to itself<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The way to override this is to use the <code>base<\/code> parameter. Since the slideshow SWF and its XML file are typically in the same directory, set the base value to the absolute path to that directory. It should look something like this:<\/p>\n<pre><code>[kml_flashembed movie=\"\/path\/to\/my\/slideshow.swf\" base=\"\/path\/to\/my\/\" \/]\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Of course, if your XML lives in a different directory, they you should change the value of the <code>base<\/code> parameter to match.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>My Flash movie references external XML\/image\/audio\/video\/etc. files to populate its content and it\u2019s not working. What\u2019s going on?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the <code>fvars<\/code> attribute to pass your Flash movie a path to an external file, make sure the path you&#8217;re feeding it is <strong>absolute, not relative<\/strong>. As in the first question above, when a SWF is embedded in an HTML page, the browser references other files that the SWF may ask for <em>relative to the HTML page, not the SWF<\/em>. Using absolute paths is the best way to make sure the browser always knows where to find those files.<\/p>\n<p>In situations like the SlideShowPro question above, It may be the case that a relative path to an XML file is embedded in the SWF itself. If you can&#8217;t override the path in the SWF, you can use KFE&#8217;s <code>base<\/code> attribute to define a absolute base URL that the relative path will use as its point of reference to find those files.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I made sure to use an absolute path to reference my SWF (and it&#8217;s assets), but it&#8217;s still not working. Help!<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>In cases like this, the simplest answer is usually the best. Take that absolute URL, put it directly in a browser&#8217;s address bar and try to load the file in the browser. Do you see it? If not, make sure to correct the URL to point to the right place and then update your KFE tag with the correct URL. If you do see the file, but is still doesn&#8217;t work in your KFE tag, then feel free to <a href=\"http:\/\/kimili.com\/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact me<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I use KFE on my WordPress.com blog?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, no. Because it&#8217;s a hosted service, wordpress.com doesn&#8217;t allow you the same freedom to install plugins and otherwise customize your site the way that you can with your own WordPress installation on your own server.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I see KFE tags instead of my Flash movies on my WordPress site. How can I fix this?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is <em>usually<\/em> due to some missing function calls when using a non-default theme. If you&#8217;re experiencing this problem and have your site running with a custom theme, the best thing to do is to go into the theme editor and check the header and footer templates. They should have function calls as follows:<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Header _typically header.php_<\/h4>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Footer _typically footer.php_<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If either the <code>wp_head()<\/code> or the <code>wp_footer()<\/code> php functions are missing, <strong>KFE will not work<\/strong>, so you&#8217;ll need to add them in. They should be placed, respectively, just before the <code>&lt;\/head&gt;<\/code> and <code>&lt;\/body&gt;<\/code> elements, as illustrated above.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I have HTML drop-down menus (or some other positioned HTML elements) which get hidden behind my Flash movie. How can I fix this?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Fortunately, there&#8217;s a very simple remedy for this. Just set the <code>wmode<\/code> attribute to <code>transparent<\/code> in your KFE tag and you should be good to go.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I set the `play` attribute to `false` in my KFE, but the video I&#8217;m embedding still plays. What gives?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The <code>play<\/code> parameter is misleading when it comes to embedding video. What it does is tell a simple flash movie with a timeline to play or stop, but that&#8217;s not the case with video. At its simplest, Flash video requires you have a player SWF &#8211; which has the playback controls and the stage for showing the video &#8211; and a video file &#8211; most likely an FLV &#8211; which gets loaded in the player SWF. The KFE <code>play<\/code> parameter has no control over the playback of video, but the player SWF does. Most video player SWFs have some way to play or stop the loaded video defined which is specific to that player. It could be a parameter that you pass to the video player when you load it. It could be a Javascript function that you call. It could be a combination of these things, too. You&#8217;d need to reference the documentation of the player that you&#8217;re using in order to find out what works for you in your specific situation.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I center or add some space around Flash movies on my page?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is easy to do using a bit of CSS. By default, KFE renders Flash movies either within a <code>&lt;div&gt;<\/code> or an <code>&lt;object&gt;<\/code> element with has a class name of &#8220;flashmovie&#8221; (or whatever you set in your <a href=\"#configuration\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">configuration options<\/a>). Utilizing that, you can add a CSS definition like this:<\/p>\n<pre><code>div.flashmovie {\n    margin: 1em auto;\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>That will add a 1 em margin on the top and bottom as well as center of all the Flash movies on your site that you&#8217;ve inserted using KFE. Also, remember that if you can apply a different class name to a certain Flash movies using the <code>targetclass<\/code> attribute. This is useful if you want to, for example, use a Flash movie in the header on your site and don&#8217;t want the default margins you&#8217;ve specified in your CSS to be applied to it.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I make my Flash movie clickable?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you want somebody to be able to click on your Flash movie and have it work as a link, then you actually have to build that link, or clickable area into your SWF. KFE cannot &#8220;wrap&#8221; your SWF with a link.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I open a new window when someone clicks on my Flash movie?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, re-read the previous question.<\/p>\n<p>Now, if you still want to open a new window from your Flash movie, be aware that it&#8217;s a <em>bad idea<\/em> because it probably won&#8217;t work. You&#8217;d have to embed a <code>window.open()<\/code> javascript call in your movie, but the problem is that when you do that and someone clicks on it, any decent browser with a popup blocker (most, these days) will not allow it. Fact is, because the Flash player is a <em>plugin<\/em>, browsers don&#8217;t know whether a javascript call which originates from within a Flash movie was triggered by user interaction or programatically. Since the latter can easily be used with malicious intent (if you&#8217;ve ever see a Windows machine infected with spyware, you know what I&#8217;m talking about), browsers simply don&#8217;t allow it. Don&#8217;t do it.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Does this thing work with FLV files?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure it does, but you can&#8217;t just reference a FLV file directly with KFE. You have to insert a video player SWF onto your page and load an FLV into <em>that<\/em>. If you don&#8217;t have an video player SWF, there are a number available online such as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.longtailvideo.com\/players\/jw-flv-player\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">JW FLV Media Player<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The general approach you&#8217;d take with KFE is to embed your video player as the SWF and use the <code>fvars<\/code> attribute to specify either the url to the FLV file the URL to a playlist that references the FLV file(s). The specifics of how the <code>fvars<\/code> would be defined depends on the particular requirements of your FLV player.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I&#8217;d like to use KFE to put a Flash header in my WordPress site. How do I do it?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can put a <code>kml_flashembed<\/code> tag anywhere on your site, but it requires some familiarity with editing PHP and HTML files. With the Tag Generator, the plugin is set up to insert tags in posts very easily, but you can manually insert a tag in any of your theme files as well. Simply navigate to <em>Appearance &rarr; Editor<\/em>, select one of your current Theme&#8217;s PHP files, and insert a KFE tag among the HTML and PHP where you want your SWF to appear.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Help! I installed KFE on my WordPress site and everything blew up! What do I do?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The first step is to check for incompatibilities with another plugin. Leaving KFE active, disable other plugins you have active one at a time, each time checking to see if your site is still blowing up. The moment you see that it doesn&#8217;t, the last plugin you disabled is the culprit &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/kimili.com\/contact\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">let me know about it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this assumes that you are using a stock installation of WordPress, which is the only type of installation I&#8217;ve tested this plugin on. If you&#8217;re using a non-standard theme or you&#8217;ve modified or hacked the core PHP files in any way, I cannot guarantee any functionality, nor offer you support on how to fix things when they go awry. Sorry.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m still having trouble getting KFE to work in my WordPress site. Can you show me what to do?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s using an old version of the plugin, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brooksandrus.com\/blog\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Brooks Andrus<\/a> has put together <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brooksandrus.com\/blog_assets\/fitc\/word_press\/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">a helpful screencast<\/a> that walks through process of installing an using KFE.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>Version 2.5.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue with the 2.5.2 release which threw a syntax version error in some versions of PHP.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Version 2.5.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue which caused KFE to break in WordPress 4.3.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Version 2.5.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Whoops! 2.5 shipped with some undefined variable bugs!
