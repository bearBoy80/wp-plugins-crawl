POSTS and PAGES CPT Lister receives the following arguments :  excludelist - This is where you say from which CPT you want to get your posts. The post type names should be separated by comma like \"cpt1,cpt2\" status - This is a comma separated list of post statuses. You can supply either 'publish' or 'future' or 'pending' or 'draft' or 'trash' values here.          If you supply a value \"publish,draft\" to this argument, only post types having atleast one post with either 'publish' status ot 'draft' status \n         will be displayed. \n         Arguments are not case sensitive. 'Publish,Draft\" \"publish,draft\" will yield the same result. (or even \"PuBLish,dRAFt\") for that matter. <\/code><\/pre>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/filter-cpt-lister.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":[],"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
