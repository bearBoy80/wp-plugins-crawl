First, it is difficult to distinguish witch site that I'm copying from because they all display as the domain name truncated without the folder. I could tel from the name of the sites menu name.\nResult 3 copies of the full menu inside the menu that i was copying from. I had to remove the menu and redo it.\nMake the sites distinguishable and copy them to the right place and ill make it a 5 star!\nThx for the effort.\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/network-copier.1.2.2.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"copier":"copier","copy":"copy","menu":"menu","multisite":"multisite","network":"network"},"versions":{"1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/network-copier.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/network-copier.1.2.zip","1.2.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/network-copier.1.2.1.zip","1.2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/network-copier.1.2.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/network-copier.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
