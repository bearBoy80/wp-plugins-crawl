rule and save, select one of the special rule (like home or search) and click the override button.<br \/>\nThe plugin will load default rule, allowing you to modify and save, after that GSP Assets Manager will use apply the rule to the intended pages (like search for search pages)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/gsp-assets-manager\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2642469\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/gsp-assets-manager\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2642469\" alt=\"After instaling the plugin, got to plugin list and click &quot;Run GSP Assets Manager&quot;\"><\/a><p>After instaling the plugin, got to plugin list and click \"Run GSP Assets Manager\"<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/gsp-assets-manager\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2642469\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/gsp-assets-manager\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2642469\" alt=\"Your website will open and you will see GSP plugin icon in the left side, move your cursor to it.\"><\/a><p>Your website will open and you will see GSP plugin icon in the left side, move your cursor to it.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/gsp-assets-manager\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2642469\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/gsp-assets-manager\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2642469\" alt=\"Now you can modify your assets, the assets will be grouped by plugins, uncheck the asset you don&#039;t want to load, swtich between stylesheets and javascripts, you can see live changes for stylesheets loading\/unloading, remember to save when you finish, Saving will refresh the website and if there is any javascript error you will get a message so you may re-enable a javascript file if you missed things up, also notice the roles list in the top, &#039;All&#039;
