You get to choose from some solid Bible Translations, four different Bible reading plans, the starting date, and more!

Users can choose their options from their WordPress User Profile, or you can give them access on the front end with a shortcode.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mybiblereading.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">View this plugin in action on MyBibleReading.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The daily reading includes a link to the passage on Blue Letter Bible.<\/p>\n<h4>Four Bible Reading Plans<\/h4>\n<p>These plans each have a different pace to accommodate the wide range of users, schedules and goals.<br \/>\n* Bible In 3 Years ( One Or Two Chapters Each Day )<br \/>\n* Bible In 1 Year &#8211; 3 Tracks ( Three Or Four Chapters Each Day )<br \/>\n* Bible In 1 Year ( Three Or Four Chapters Each Day )<br \/>\n* New Testament In 1 Year ( One Chapter Or Less Each Day )<br \/>\n<em>Additional reading plans may be made available in future versions.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Important Shortcodes<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Display Today&#8217;s Reading: [mbr_display_todays_reading]<\/li>\n<li>Front End User Options: [mbr_customize_reading_form]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Install <strong>My Bible Reading<\/strong> like any other WordPress plugin, directly from your plugins page.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Visit the plugin settings page to set the defaults and options ( Tools -&gt; My Bible Reading )<\/li>\n<li>(optional) Add a Daily Reading element to your website with the shortcode [mbr_display_todays_reading]<\/li>\n<li>(optional) Create a new page for users to set their preferences with the shortcode [mbr_customize_reading_form]<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20include%20the%20bible%20version%20texts%3F'>\nDoes this plugin include the Bible version texts?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No Bible versions are contained in the plugin itself.
