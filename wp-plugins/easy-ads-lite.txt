I will keep adding more ad providers, or even let the end-users add them.<\/li>\n<li>Expertise Level: I plan to introduce expertise levels (Easy, Advanced and Expert tabs) within the tab for each ad provider.<\/li>\n<li>Max Number of Ad blocks: Since some providers require you to limit the number of ad blocks to some policy-driven ceiling, I will expose that option to you. Also to be customized is the number of ads per slot. In this initial release, there are three slots (top, middle and bottom), each of which can take two ad blocks. In a future release, you will have much more customization options.<\/li>\n<li>Internationalization: Future versions will provide MO\/PO files for internationalization.<\/li>\n<li>Documentation: As this plugin may have an overwhelming set of options and features, I will try to write a comprehensive help system for it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","installation":"<h4>Searching<\/h4>\n<p>The easiest way to install this plugin is to use the WordPress Admin interface.

The <a href=\"https:\/\/buy.thulasidas.com\/easy-ads\" title=\"Pro version of the Easy Ads plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro version<\/a> gives you more benefits &#8212; lets you activate a filter to ensure that your ads show only on those pages that seem to comply with Google AdSense policies. It also lets you specify a list of computers where your ads will not be shown, in order to prevent accidental clicks on your own ads &#8212; one of the main reasons AdSense bans you. These features will minimize your chance of getting banned. The Pro version costs $8.95, and is appropriate if you expect to make more than $150 of ad revenue from your site.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How can I contact the plugin author if I need help?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin uses a paid support model in order to manage the support load. Each <a href=\"http:\/\/support.thulasidas.com\" title=\"Ask a support question\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support ticket<\/a> will be charged at $0.95 for the Lite version (and for the Pro version after a short free support period). The support ticket is valid for 72 hours, and further follow-up questions will call for a new support ticket.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I still don&#8217;t get it. Porn and site block &#8211; that you already have during Asdense ad setup?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>What you have in AdSense is an ability to block ads from certain sites. For instance, if you don&#8217;t like ads <em>from<\/em> my site &#8220;thulasidas.com&#8221;, you can block them. What the pro version gives you is the ability to block ads <em>to<\/em> certain clients. That is, if you don&#8217;t want visitors from certain IP addresses see your ads (because they may click on too many of them, getting your AdSense account banned, for instance), you can with my plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Porn block also is similar &#8212; Google lets you choose non-porn ads (I think). What my plugin does is to look at the content of your page, and block ads if it looks like a porn page. (This can happen if a spammer posts a porn kind of comment on your blog, which again may get your AdSense account banned.)<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I enabled the widgets for various ad providers. But I don&#8217;t see any on my blog pages. How come?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The widgets are enabled and available on your Appearance -&gt; Widgets area. Please drag and drop them to the appropriate side-bar.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I get the error &#8220;Error locating or loading the defaults! Ensure &#8216;defaults.php&#8217; exists, or reinstall the plugin.&#8221; What to do?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please copy <em>all<\/em> the files in the zip archive to your plugin directory. You need all the files in the <code>easy-ads-lite<\/code> directory. One of these files is the missing <code>defaults.php<\/code>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I activate the plugin, but nothing happens. I see some red error message stating something about PHP version. What gives?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin requires PHP version 5.x or later. If it doesn&#8217;t find the right version, it posts an error message in the plugins page, and does nothing. You will need to contact the system admin or support folks of your hosting service and request them to install PHP5.x for you. Usually, all it takes is just an email to get it sorted out.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How can I control the appearance of the ad blocks using CSS?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>All <code>&lt;div&gt;<\/code>s that <em>Easy Ads<\/em> creates have the class attribute <code>easy-ads<\/code>. Furthermore, they have class attributes like <code>easy-ads-adsense-top<\/code>, <code>easy-ads-clicksor-bottom<\/code> etc., (i.e., <code>easy-ads-provider-position<\/code>). You can set the style for these classes in your theme <code>style.css<\/code> to control their appearance.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why does my code disappear when I switch to a new theme?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p><em>Easy Ads<\/em> stores the ad code and options in your database indexed by the theme name, so that if you set up the options for a particular theme, they persist even when you switch to another theme. If you ever switch back to an old theme, all your options will be reused without your worrying about it.<\/p>\n<p>But this unfortunately means that you do have to set the code <em>once<\/em> whenever you switch to a new theme.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I control how the ad blocks are formatted in each page?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! In <em>Easy Ads<\/em>, you have more options [through <strong>custom fields<\/strong>] to control ad blocks in individual posts\/pages. Add custom fields with keys like <strong>easy-ads-adsense-top, easy-ads-adsense-middle, easy-ads-adsense-bottom<\/strong> and with values like <strong>left, right, center<\/strong> or <strong>no<\/strong> to have control how the ad blocks show up in each post or page. The value &#8220;<strong>no<\/strong>&#8221; suppresses all the ad blocks in the post or page for that provider.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<ul>\n<li>V4.20: Compatibility with WP4.8.
