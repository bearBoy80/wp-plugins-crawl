But after trying several other options and not quite getting what I wanted, I installed Google Docs RSVP.  It took a little adventuring during the install, as the steps are not EXACTLY as described, but I managed to get it all working!\n\nUsing test data, I've come to understand how the plugin works.  It's pretty straightforward, and I think it does about 85% of what I am looking for, without too much hassle, and it works great with Google Sheets!  Which is a big reason why I'm sticking with it.\n\nI was able to edit some of the text that shows up for the RSVP, going through the Plugin Editor... it's not for the faint of heart though; one wrong move and you could kill the plugin or even worse, your whole site.\n\nOne thing I'd really like to see, if anyone is capable of coding this ASAP, is more customization (or showing me how to do it).  I'd like to add or change questions, with different question types (radio, checkbox, multi-line text field, etc.).  Specifically, I want to add questions for meals, food allergies and restrictions, kids\/babies, etc.  I'd be more than happy to donate a small amount to make this happen.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">No longer working<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"4 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"4\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/sarahnev\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/88b5fc03b08a405e2a065241fd910741?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/88b5fc03b08a405e2a065241fd910741?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/sarahnev\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Sarah <small>(sarahnev)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>This is a very cool plugin but not often updated.
