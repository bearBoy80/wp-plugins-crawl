Note: In order for this plugin to properly generate images, your server must have PHP configured with the GD2 library.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I make this work?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find the Favicon Generator section in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Upload an image. Generally speaking this would be your logo or something of that nature.<\/li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it! Your website now has an awesome favicon.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why isn&#8217;t my favicon showing up?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some browsers hang on to old favicon images in their cache. This is an unfortunate side effect of caching. If you make a change to your favicon and don&#8217;t immediately see the change, don&#8217;t start banging your head against the wall. This is not an indication that this plugin is not working. Try <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bypass_your_cache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">emptying your cache<\/a> and quitting the browser.<\/p>\n<p>If that doesn&#8217;t work, it could also be because your theme doesn&#8217;t make use of WordPress&#8217; wp_head() function. If this is the case, sadly you&#8217;ll have to edit your theme. This function is what allows us to automagically insert the favicon code. Most modern themes comply with this WordPress standard, so this really shouldn&#8217;t be the problem unless you built your own custom theme or are using a really old theme.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/favicon-generator\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1573768\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/favicon-generator\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1573768\" alt=\"Favicon Generator configuration screen\"><\/a><p>Favicon Generator configuration screen<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/favicon-generator\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1573768\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/favicon-generator\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1573768\" alt=\"Shows the favicon in place\"><\/a><p>Shows the favicon in place<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/favicon-generator.1.5.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/favicon-generator\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1573768","caption":"Favicon Generator configuration screen"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/favicon-generator\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1573768","caption":"Shows the favicon in place"}},"tags":{"favicon":"favicon"},"versions":{"1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/favicon-generator.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/favicon-generator.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/favicon-generator.1.3.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/favicon-generator.1.4.zip","1.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/favicon-generator.1.5.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/favicon-generator.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=3441397","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/favicon-generator\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=588605","high":false}}
