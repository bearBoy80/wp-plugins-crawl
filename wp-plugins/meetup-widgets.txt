It seems this is not true. It cannot be added with a URL. In fact, there seems to be no field for entering a URL. If it's added in the space for the API, it only shows up in the widget as \"add a valid API key.\"\n\nAdditionally, which of multiple API keys to use is confusing for many people, and your explanation is so abstract as not to qualify as an explanation at all.\n\nI see that only one other person has asked for help with a problem with your plugin, and it was never resolved. I hope you do at least try to offer support. \n\nAnyway, if it really were possible to use a URL rather than an API, this problem were not be occurring.... which it is...<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">No useful info on installing, uninstalled - shocking- please improve<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jasonwilldo\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ec292cf2827098095104debd6bd59e41?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ec292cf2827098095104debd6bd59e41?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jasonwilldo\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">jasonwilldo<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>support documentation is non exisitant.. maybe for a fulltime Dev perhaps...<br \/>\nshocking.<br \/>\nits a bit like meetup RSVPs 75% no-shows, and a waste of organisers time and effort.<\/p>\n<p>add full descriptions, frickin meetup (where i was directed for the API) was no better... no info at all what the \"stuff\" was I was to input was.... <\/p>\n<p>i can see why all meetup plugins fail in WP.<br \/>\nplease improve n ill check back, and upgrade my rating.... really!!!! what were you thinking to put no decent info up?\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/meetup-widgets.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/meetup-widgets\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1538919","caption":"Example of the single event detail widget, shows title, date, an excerpt of the description, number of currently-rsvp'd attendees, a link to RSVP (through OAuth if configured), and the location (linking to a google map)."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/meetup-widgets\/trunk\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1538919","caption":"Example of the upcoming event list widget.
