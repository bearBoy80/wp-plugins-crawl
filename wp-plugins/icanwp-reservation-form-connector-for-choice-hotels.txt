This feature makes the reservation process easier for the hotel&#8217;s customers and prevents them to go directly to the ChoiceHotels.com and compare against competitors. As of April 6th, 2018, it is confirmed to work with the following franchise of ChoiceHotels:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ascend Hotel Collection<\/li>\n<li>Cambria Hotels and Suites<\/li>\n<li>Comfort Inn<\/li>\n<li>Comfort Suites<\/li>\n<li>Sleep Inn<\/li>\n<li>Quality Inn<\/li>\n<li>Clarion<\/li>\n<li>MainStay Suites<\/li>\n<li>Suburban<\/li>\n<li>Econolodge<\/li>\n<li>Rodeway Inn<\/li>\n<li>Any other branches or franchise of ChoiceHotels using ChoiceHotels.com<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Uninstall<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>All saved options will be deleted from the database.
