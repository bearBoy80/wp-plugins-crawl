This is a fantastic plugin.\n\nAt the moment we have to select a lot of options as the plugin says hide from XXXXXXXX instead of show XXXXXXXX and this is where my problem came from. I just selected everything except Administrator and couldn't figure out what was happening at first. I quickly figured out we need to have both <strong>Administrator<\/strong> and <strong>user logged in<\/strong> both unselected, if we wanted to see the block as Administrator only though. If we only leave <strong>Administrator<\/strong> unselected nothing happens at all. Maybe the setting could do with an update. \n\nAdvice to make it even better: Having something like the options below would allow more setting combinations and make using the plugin even easier. \n\nHide from:\n\nAdministrator logged both in &amp; out\nAdministrator logged in\nAdministrator logged out\n\nSubscriber logged both in &amp; out\nSubscriber logged in\nSubscriber logged out\n\nEtc...\n\nJust now you can't select hide from Administrator logged out and Subscriber logged in, etc., at the same time. I realize if you selected both <strong>Subscriber logged both in &amp; out<\/strong> and <strong>Subscriber logged in<\/strong> or <strong>Subscriber logged out<\/strong> the two bottom options wouldn't have any effect but it would still make the plugin easier to use.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Works as advertised...<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/nick6352683\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/91e8faddd8ea5b552e8f98ac0f15c575?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/91e8faddd8ea5b552e8f98ac0f15c575?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/nick6352683\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">nick6352683<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">April 16, 2019<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">5 star plugin obviously since it works as advertised can can be really helpful  under certain conditions. I hope the development of the plugin continues, and a feature to also display (or not to display) the blocks for certain devices is also added (desktop, tablet, phone). This feature to be implemented should be easier to code because all you need to trigger the conditions are some simple CSS media queries.\n\nGood job so far nevertheless...<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/user-block-visibility.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/user-block-visibility\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2068159","caption":"Showing a block with visibility restricted for subscribers and users who are not logged in."}},"tags":{"blocks":"blocks","gutenberg":"gutenberg","users":"users"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
