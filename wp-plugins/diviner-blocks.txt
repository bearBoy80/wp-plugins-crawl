We plan on adding more and more blocks using features of Gutenberg to the fullest.

As it is a complimentary plugin, it is not that refined and generalised to be used universally. Consider this as a beta test. The plugin will be constantly improved and we&#8217;re sure one day, when we feel it is ready to be used on a universal scale, we&#8217;ll definitely do it.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nWhat kind of blocks are provided?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the initial, release we decided to go with three custom blocks including a Carousel(powered by bxSlider), a Call to Action Section and a Information Box. We prioritised quality over quantity, so instead of providing a multitude of blocks. There are three well refined (we hope) blocks.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Resources<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/bxslider.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">bxSlider<\/a> Steven Wanderski (http:\/\/stevenwanderski.com\/) MIT License (http:\/\/opensource.org\/licenses\/MIT)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/diviner-blocks.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"blocks":"blocks","diviner":"diviner","gutenberg":"gutenberg"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
