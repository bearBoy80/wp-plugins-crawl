there. The ability to segment our new subscriber list by interest and time zone has helped inform our content strategy and we've gotten great feedback from our viewers so far. \n\nPushnami creates options that any marketer would appreciate, and I'd recommend them to anybody looking for a new push platform.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">The best push platform<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/sportsnews400\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/21754fc3dacdc40bda5d8447d1681955?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/21754fc3dacdc40bda5d8447d1681955?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/sportsnews400\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">sportsnews400<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 16, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">There are a lot of push notification plugins. I tested a few and Pushnami is the best. I am able to capture subscribers, either through a one-step or two-step opt-in, and every time I publish a new post, it gets sent automatically to my subscribers. Their support team helped me set up something custom and no other push provider could really do what I wanted to do, but they could. Love that it's free to get started with too. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pushnami-web-push-notifications.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pushnami-web-push-notifications\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2305267","caption":"An example of a web push notification on Windows 10, with a large image and customizable buttons."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pushnami-web-push-notifications\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2305267","caption":"An abandoned cart retargeting example push on Windows 10."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pushnami-web-push-notifications\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2305267","caption":"The main dashboard view, which provides an overview of your performance and key stats."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pushnami-web-push-notifications\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2305267","caption":"Omnichannel notification creation allows you to create your notifications in the easiest, most efficient way possible."},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pushnami-web-push-notifications\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2305267","caption":"View all your campaign and subscriber stats within one page, easily filtered and exported for internal reporting purposes."},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pushnami-web-push-notifications\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=2305267","caption":"\u201cGod\u2019s Eye\u201d reporting view allows you to see a snapshot of your performance, including your creatives, key stats, and more."},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pushnami-web-push-notifications\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=2305267","caption":"Smart Subscribe custom two-step opt-in prompts allow you to control how your visitors are asked to subscribe to your notifications."}},"tags":{"chrome":"chrome","notifications":"Notifications","push":"push","push-notifications":"push notifications","webpush":"webpush"},"versions":{"0.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pushnami-web-push-notifications.0.0.1.zip","1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pushnami-web-push-notifications.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pushnami-web-push-notifications.1.0.1.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pushnami-web-push-notifications.1.0.3.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pushnami-web-push-notifications.1.0.4.zip","1.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pushnami-web-push-notifications.1.0.5.zip","1.0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pushnami-web-push-notifications.1.0.6.zip","1.0.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pushnami-web-push-notifications.1.0.7.zip","1.0.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pushnami-web-push-notifications.1.0.8.zip","1.0.9":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/pushnami-web-push-notifications.1.0.9.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pushnami-web-push-notifications\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2305267","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/pushnami-web-push-notifications\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2305267"}}
