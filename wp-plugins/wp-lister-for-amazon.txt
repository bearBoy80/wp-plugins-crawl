About 2 years ago we wanted to list on amazon and use this plugin. \n\nIt automatically pulls everything through from our sales on amazon, and takes our listings from woocommerce onto amazon. \n\nThis means that I log in to amazon only a couple of times a month to download statements etc - everything else is part of our normal workflow. It even integrates with Advanced Shipment Tracking for WooCommerce to put tracking numbers in to amazon. \n\nThe settings are very detailed, with lots of things to tweak if you want to, but the default settings are mostly correct. The support is always polite and patient, even when I have a problem that is caused by having the wrong settings.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Awesome plugin !!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/gevcen\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/dabf8a47a0768c8d54d5a66fb6066d6b?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/dabf8a47a0768c8d54d5a66fb6066d6b?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/gevcen\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">gevcen<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">January 13, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">The few bad reviews I see here are not deserved.

The server responded with code 504: Gateway Timeout. The gateway did not receive a timely response from the upstream server or application.\n\nand\n\nCouldn't fetch URL server returned error code 503\n\nI've just spent the best part of a day trying to coax products into woocommerce from amazon to be faced with these errors. I sent a email in for support, but no reply back as of yet. \n\nIf you have a substantially sized catalogue that you are trying to sync I cant feasibly see how this plugin will provide a stable and reliable platform to perform that action.\n\nAnother issue i found is that if you uninstall the plugin completely, then reinstall it, none of the entries into the database are removed. You jump right back in where you left it. \n\nIf any of the devs could look into this and provide me assistance it would be appreciated, but as of my current experience i cant recommend this plugin to be reliable.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Basic, but not easy<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tictubso\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1f0efe6e02d246d2c31b8a242bc368bf?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1f0efe6e02d246d2c31b8a242bc368bf?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tictubso\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">tictubso<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">March 20, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">As others have said this lacks documentation and the support offered is average at best. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-lister-for-amazon.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"amazon":"amazon","import":"import","integration":"integration","products":"products","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-lister-for-amazon\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2644005","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-lister-for-amazon\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=2644005"}}
