This plugin takes the first image (by default) from post body and assignes it as a post Featured Image. It helps if your theme supports post thumbnails feature and you want to assign Featured Image for all your existing posts.<\/p>\n<p>Plugin performs mass manipulation on posts Featured Image property and uploads files if they are stored externally. Don&#8217;t forget to backup your files and database before using this plugin.<\/p>\n<p>It displays log of success\/fails. There is also a feature to remove all Featured Images from all posts &#8211; this only changes post setting, no actual files are removed.<\/p>\n<p>Related Links:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.shaldybina.com\/plugins\/generate-post-thumbnails\/\" title=\"Generate Post Thumbnails Plugin for WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugin Homepage<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Extract zip in the \/wp-content\/plugins\/ directory.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Open the plugin management page, which is located under Tools -&gt; Generate Thumbnails.
