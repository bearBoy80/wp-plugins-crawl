Vulnerabilities in the WordPress core, plugins, and themes can all leave your website prone to a cyber attack leading to loss of critical data and financial losses.<\/p>\n<p>That is why you need to proactively tackle WordPress website security and make sure you\u2019re secure from common WordPress security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, file inclusion exploits, directory traversal, and many more.<\/p>\n<p>With Beagle Security, you can find complex attack vectors WordPress vulnerability scanners fail to detect. Vulnerability scanners give you quick scan results, but they are not designed to identify modern security threats.<\/p>\n<p>By leveraging an AI-powered core, Beagle Security does in-depth penetration tests on your website and discovers all the loopholes in it. With evidence-based vulnerability reporting, you get insights into the occurrence of each vulnerability on your website and actionable recommendations on how to fix the discovered security issues and secure your website.<\/p>\n<h3>Beagle Security\u2019s free plugin helps you to:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Connect securely to your Beagle Security account<\/li>\n<li>Complete domain verification with just a button\u2019s click<\/li>\n<li>Start\/stop tests from your WP admin console<\/li>\n<li>See the progress of running tests<\/li>\n<li>View test results with total vulnerabilities in your website<\/li>\n<li>Understand the classification of vulnerabilities according to the severity<\/li>\n<li>Know the security score of your website<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>WHY CHOOSE BEAGLE SECURITY<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Compliant with global security standards like OWASP and SANS <\/li>\n<li>Set up in less than 5 minutes- no coding required<\/li>\n<li>Constantly updated vulnerability database with latest threats and zero-day vulnerabilities<\/li>\n<li>AI-powered core for human-like decision making<\/li>\n<li>Lowest false positives<\/li>\n<li>Authenticated testing for complex websites with login module<\/li>\n<li>Ensure security compliance with continuous vulnerability assessments<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>GETTING STARTED<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to have an account on Beagle Security to use this plugin.

It is for pen testing. Which some people might not understand but basically it acts like a hacker and then proceeds to check both your website security and server (web host) security.\n\nAfter anywhere from one to two days of grueling testing it generates a rather detailed report of what security problems you have on your website.\n\nThe thought process behind this plugin is simple,\n\"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" which basically means it's easier to stop a problem before it happens than to fix the problem after it happens.\n\nBeagle does this well by informing you about the latest exploits that can harm your website. Some of their recommendations your probably not going to be able to fix as many I found were server related meaning, you most likely have a pretty poor host. However, when I showed this report to my web host I was surprised to see how well they reacted sometimes pointing out errors of my own and sometimes admitting that they had holes or flaws in their security.\n\nEither way if you do any real website testing, I would recommend Beagle. \n\nThere are a few things they can fix:\n\n1.) Website and WordPress app have flipped values when installing the plugin. The website ask for application token and then access token. The plugin asks for access token then application. Someone who is moving through it fast and not reading will think it should follow the website. Make it uniform just to keep standards the same. Rather than flip flopping.\n\n2.) The report is good. Links to suggested fixes for resources would improve the report itself. It gives a basic summary which I had to Google. A small list of fixes or website resources would be super helpful. Consider including.\n\nThanks for the hard work. Even these small issues are not enough to knock it down.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing.1.0.8.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2488088","caption":"Connect easily by setting up an access token and application token"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2488088","caption":"One-click domain verification"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2488088","caption":"Start tests from your WP admin console"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2488088","caption":"See the progress of running tests"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2488088","caption":"Know the security score of your website, view test results and classification of vulnerabilities according to the severity"}},"tags":{"security":"security","security-plugin":"security plugin","security-testing":"security testing","website-security":"WebSite Security","wordpress-security":"wordpress security"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing.1.0.3.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing.1.0.4.zip","1.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing.1.0.5.zip","1.0.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing.1.0.6.zip","1.0.7":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing.1.0.7.zip","1.0.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing.1.0.8.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/beaglesecurity.com\/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=3rd_party&utm_campaign=integration","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/beagle-security-wp-security-advanced-penetration-testing\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2488079","high":false}}
