Most sites use a \u201cCost of Goods\u201d plugin to analyze profit (sales less cost of goods), but this is not a true measure of profitability. The cost of shipping orders is significant, and in many businesses, it can be even more expensive than the cost of goods, so including the cost of shipping in your analysis is critical to running a successful eCommerce business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NEW!<\/strong> Using WooCommerce Services to buy your shipping labels? Well we have just made new functionality that allows amount spent on shipping to be imported directly into the order! The plugin will automatically do this if the labels have been purchased before the order is marked complete, or there is a manual import button found neatly on the right sidebar while editing orders. Whether you purchase one, multipls labels, or refund labels, we report the Cost of Shipping directly to you!<\/p>\n<p>After installing this plugin you\u2019ll be able to manually add or adjust the cost of shipping for each order on the WooCommerce Edit Order page. <strong>Better yet<\/strong>, if you use ShipStation then the cost of shipping for each order will be automatically imported as your orders are shipped. If you ship multi-package orders, the total cost of all packages will be imported. If you void a ShipStation shipment and then reship (change shipping method, address, etc.), the new cost of shipping will be imported. It\u2019s all automated and you\u2019re going to love it!<\/p>\n<p>Once you start tracking the cost of shipping, you\u2019ll want to use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theritesites.com\/plugins\/woocommerce-net-profit\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Net Profit<\/a> plugin that will give you beautiful, functional reports to fully analyze your profitability.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you use your income statement to track the cost of shipping?<\/strong><br \/>\nMost eCommerce businesses do, but this just gives you a high level view of the overall profitability of your business. What\u2019s missing is the ability to determine true profitability at the individual order level.<\/p>\n<p>For example:<br \/>\n* If you ship out of California, how does your profit on an order shipped to a customer in California compared to the same order shipped to a customer in New York?<br \/>\n* How does your profit on an order that weighs 2 pounds compare to orders that weigh 5, 10 or 20 pounds?<br \/>\n* If you offer free shipping on orders over a certain dollar amount ($50, $75, etc.), how does the profit on those orders compare to the profit on orders that you are charging a shipping fee?<br \/>\n* How does your profit on a $25 order compare to your profit on a $50, $100 or $200 order?<\/p>\n<p>Only after you have the cost of shipping data at the order level can you make these comparisons (and more), and then make smart adjustments to the way you offer your products to maximize profitability.<\/p>\n<h3>Manual Installation<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>\/woo-cost-of-shipping<\/code> directory to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory.<\/li>\n<li>Activate WooCommerce Cost of Shipping through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Enjoy the easy editting of the cost of shipping in the edit order screen, below the order total.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='cost%20of%20shipping%20from%20shipstation%20is%20not%20being%20saved%20or%20imported'>\nCost of Shipping from ShipStation is not being saved or imported\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a common issue we have found in the ShipStation Marketplace Configuration.

The first 16 years we operated on an in-house developed platform that managed every aspect of our business, but for a variety of reasons we decided to migrate to WooCommerce and went live in February 2018.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints with WooCommerce was the complete lack of ability to tack and analyze true profitability. While you can track cost of goods with 3rd party plugins, it's not complete if you're unable to capture the cost of shipping data as well. In our case, the cost of shipping a package ranges from $7 to $50, but we only charge our customers a small portion (starting at $2.95 flat rate). We have to do this because people would never pay the actual cost of shipping. That results in us incurring very large shipping expenses that come directly out of profit. While I can see our total monthly shipping expenses in our accounting system, I have no way of knowing how profitable a particular order is, or particular type of order (weight, shipping zone, etc.).\n\nWhen we got this plugin it was truly a game charger as far as being able to manage our business. It works flawlessly and imports the actual cost of shipping for each order from ShipStation as soon as the order ships. We also use their \"Woocommerce Net Profit\" companion plugin that gives us all of the tools to roll this data up into reports that allows us to analyze the information and make educated changes to our business.\n\nWe looked long and hard and there was no other plugin that did what this plugin along with the Net Profit plugin were able to do. If you ship products form a WooCommerce site, you honestly should consider this plugin as mandatory.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-cost-of-shipping.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-cost-of-shipping\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1898876","caption":"A new field is added underneath the order items block, underneath the \"Total\" row, along with an edit button."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-cost-of-shipping\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1898876","caption":"Shows the JavaScript popup that allows you to manually edit the cost of shipping for this order."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-cost-of-shipping\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=2061978","caption":"Shows the meta box on the right to import Cost of Shipping, the order note put in, and the Cost of Shipping"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-cost-of-shipping\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=2061978","caption":"Shows expanded meta box and pro tip about using the plugin to its potential"},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-cost-of-shipping\/assets\/screenshot-5.jpg?rev=2061978","caption":"Shows the new interface if WooCommerce Services plugin is activated"}},"tags":{"cost-of-shipping":"cost of shipping","net-profit":"net profit","shipping-cost":"shipping cost","shipstation":"shipstation","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":{"1.3.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-cost-of-shipping.1.3.0.zip","1.4.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-cost-of-shipping.1.4.0.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.theritesites.com\/plugins\/woocommerce-cost-of-shipping","banners":[]}
