It&#8217;s installed on your server by your host. The <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/about\/requirements\/\" rel=\"ugc\">minimum required version<\/a> for WordPress is PHP 5.2.4. This version has been unsupported since early 2011 and is potentially insecure. WordPress supports it to maintain backward compatibility for sites that are still using it.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin is also build with PHP but it requires the PHP version of 5.4.0 or higher to work.<\/p>\n<p>Follow these instructions to install the plugin.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>In your WordPress admin panel, go to Plugins &gt; New Plugin, search for &#8220;additional content&#8221; and click &#8220;Install now&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Alternatively, download the plugin and upload the contents of additional-content.zip to your plugins directory, which usually is \/wp-content\/plugins\/.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin<\/li>\n<li>Add additional content in the edit or publish post screens.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>What is the priority option?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is basically a user interface for <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Plugin_API\/Filter_Reference\/the_content\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the_content filter<\/a>. This filter allows themes and plugins to change (or add content to) post content before it&#8217;s displayed. The default priority for filters is 10. Higher numbers correspond with later execution of adding additional content. This option allows you to display the additional content before or after other plugins that add content with this filter.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.3.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix bug where additional content was not displayed in pages.
