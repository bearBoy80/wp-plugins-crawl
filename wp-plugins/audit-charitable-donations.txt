We can add receipt for the spent amount against each campaign thus we can gain complete trust from the donor by providing them complete overview about how the donation is being utilised. This platform helps to maintain good relationship with the donors and also help to receive the donations for long run.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/audit-charitable-donations.1.0.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/audit-charitable-donations\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1968130","caption":"Add\/Audit expenses using this Form on Audit Donations Page"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/audit-charitable-donations\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1968130","caption":"View all your expenses on Audit Donations Page"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/audit-charitable-donations\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1968130","caption":"Use the shortcode <strong>[charitable_audit]<\/strong> to show Donations Audit Report"}},"tags":{"audit-received-donations":"Audit Received Donations","charitable":"Charitable","charitable-addon":"Charitable Addon","display-admin-report":"Display Admin Report","donors-transparency":"Donors Transparency"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/audit-charitable-donations.1.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/audit-charitable-donations.1.0.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/audit-charitable-donations.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/audit-charitable-donations\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1968130","high":false}}
