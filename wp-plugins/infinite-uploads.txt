Hosting your media files alongside your site code both slows performance and quickly creates overages for your more expensive web hosting storage. Moving your Media Library to performance-optimized cloud storage and serving your files from  a Content Delivery Network will not only save space and lower cost, it improves performance.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20let%20me%20upload%20large%20files%20like%20videos%20to%20wordpress%3F'>\nWill this let me upload large files like videos to WordPress?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our video hosting feature let&#8217;s you upload directly to the cloud from the WordPress dashboard, bypassing all host limits.

It can be used on an unlimited number of sites without per-site or per file licensing costs like competitors.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20infinite%20uploads%20plugin%20work%20without%20connecting%20to%20cloud%20storage%3F'>\nWill the Infinite Uploads plugin work without connecting to Cloud Storage?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Use the Infinite Uploads storage scanner to analyze the files in your media library. See what files are causing overages with a graphic breakdown of the files size and type and learn what content is taking up your hosting storage. You will have to connect to our cloud to use the cloud storage and CDN features.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20websites%20can%20i%20connect%20to%20one%20cloud%20account%3F'>\nHow many websites can I connect to one cloud account?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Connect an unlimited number of sites to your Infinite Uploads account at no cost.

All without the cost of a sysadmin or the complexity of configuring servers, policies, permissions, keys, etc&#8230;pure magic.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20can%27t%20i%20just%20use%20aws%20s3%2C%20google%20cloud%20storage%2C%20azure%2C%20etc%3F'>\nWhy can&#8217;t I just use AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, etc?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are plugins for that, but they all have expensive per-site or per file annual license fees. And then you have to figure out how to signup for and configure complicated cloud providers and CDNs.<br \/>\nFinally, while the per\/GB prices of cloud storage may seem cheap, there are all the hidden costs you don&#8217;t realize like class A\/B\/C\/D API transaction costs, and bandwidth x3 (to cloud &gt; to cdn &gt; to user). Bandwidth costs alone can often total 8x more than your storage bill!<br \/>\nInfinite Uploads makes the power of the cloud simple and affordable for non-cloud architects like you.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<p>2.0.1 &#8211; 2023-10-24<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix corrupt unzipping errors on manual plugin upgrades<\/li>\n<li>Fix incorrect error log entries when disconnecting from cloud<\/li>\n<li>Speed up head objects<\/li>\n<li>Fix aws config error message in PHP safe mode<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>2.0 &#8211; 2022-01-22<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release of our new cloud video upload, encode, and streaming feature!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1.1.6 &#8211; 2022-12-13<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix error handling on sync for specific error types that were breaking syncs<\/li>\n<li>Support for very large directory file counts: Allow filescan via WP CLI before connecting site to cloud<\/li>\n<li>Add an &#8216;infinite_uploads_sync_exclusions&#8217; filter to exclude files from sync<\/li>\n<li>BuddyBoss\/BuddyPress workaround: Bypass cloud storage for BuddyBoss media files<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1.1.5 &#8211; 2021-10-27<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix problems replacing urls in some multisite subsites<\/li>\n<li>Add an &#8216;infinite_uploads_replacement_urls&#8217; filter to customize url replacements<\/li>\n<li>Cache attachment size to improve performance of media grid and some frontend editing themes<\/li>\n<li>Compatibility fix for WooCommerce CSV importing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1.1.4 &#8211; 2021-9-22<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix compatibility issues with some plugins that used media_handle_sideload() function.<\/li>\n<li>Add compatibility overrides for WP Contact Form 7 and WP Migrate DB Pro.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1.1.3 &#8211; 2021-6-12<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve error handling for transient API outages to avoid breaking site images.<\/li>\n<li>Prevent deactivation of plugin until download &amp; disconnect is completed to avoid data loss.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1.1.2 &#8211; 2021-3-15<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>2x speed increase when uploading and processing new media items.<\/li>\n<li>Fix files not deleting from cloud storage when deleting attachments.<\/li>\n<li>Improved debug logging for identifying plugins causing unnecessary disk access.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1.1.1 &#8211; 2021-2-26<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prefix and filter the AWS SDK and dependencies to prevent code conflicts with other plugins and shrink plugin package size.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1.1 &#8211; 2021-2-22<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress Multisite support (subdir, subdomain, and pre-WP3.5 networks)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1.0.2 &#8211; 2021-2-12<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resumable large file uploads.

I was hoping I could connect this to Linode buckets but nope\u2026 Let me pay a premium fee to connect to other endpoints.\n\nAlso when loading the settings page, it put a total overlay over it saying to switch to the connect tab to connect my account.
