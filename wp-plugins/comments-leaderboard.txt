Simply drag the Widget into place, write a title and description text, pick a color and your blog is ready for some serious comment action.<\/p>\n<p>Just remember, keep your posts quality and you will attract quality comments.<\/p>\n<p>Let the games begin!<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>comments-leaderboard<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Go to Appearance &gt; Widgets and find the &#8216;Comments Leaderboard&#8217; Widget.

After a month, rankings will be reset and commenters will have to reclaim their status at the top.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I exclude names from ranking?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can prevent multiple names from appearing by simply typing the name you wish to remove in the Widget setting. Be sure to separate each name with a comma (,).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I list more than 5 commenters?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of now, you will need to make edits to the template file if you really need more than 5. In the future, you\u2019ll be able to edit the Leaderboard template <em>safely<\/em> through your child theme, so be careful if you choose to edit the plugin files.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new \u201cFooter Text\u201d text field so you can place text after the Leaderboard.<\/li>\n<li>Improved widget options sanitization.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Released to the world<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/comments-leaderboard\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1214384\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/comments-leaderboard\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1214384\" alt=\"&lt;p&gt;By default, the Comments Leaderboard shows a red color spectrum.&lt;\/p&gt;\"><\/a><p><p>By default, the Comments Leaderboard shows a red color spectrum.<\/p><\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/comments-leaderboard\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1650492\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/comments-leaderboard\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1650492\" alt=\"&lt;p&gt;This is what the Widget settings look like with some text filled in.&lt;\/p&gt;\"><\/a><p><p>This is what the Widget settings look like with some text filled in.<\/p><\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/comments-leaderboard\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1214382\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/comments-leaderboard\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1214382\" alt=\"&lt;p&gt;An alternative color scheme (tip: you can set any hex color code in the Widget settings)&lt;\/p&gt;\"><\/a><p><p>An alternative color scheme (tip: you can set any hex color code in the Widget settings)<\/p><\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Exactly what I need<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ckubs\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/51e06bc2ca8d7701d82fd45c82a94a37?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/51e06bc2ca8d7701d82fd45c82a94a37?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ckubs\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">ckubs<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>Lightweight, working and looks cool.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/comments-leaderboard.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/comments-leaderboard\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1214384","caption":"<p>By default, the Comments Leaderboard shows a red color spectrum.<\/p>"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/comments-leaderboard\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1650492","caption":"<p>This is what the Widget settings look like with some text filled in.<\/p>"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/comments-leaderboard\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=1214382","caption":"<p>An alternative color scheme (tip: you can set any hex color code in the Widget settings)<\/p>"}},"tags":{"comments-list":"comments list","top-commentators":"top commentators","top-commenters":"top commenters","top-comments":"top comments"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/comments-leaderboard.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/comments-leaderboard.1.1.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/kolakube.com\/comments-leaderboard\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/comments-leaderboard\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1214392","high":false}}
