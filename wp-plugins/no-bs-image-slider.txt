After installing it (it's a small but non-trivial learning curve to use) I downloaded and unpacked the source. I could hardly believe my eyes! One PHP file, 8.665 bytes; and one CSS file, 1.429 bytes. That's IT. And btw it's really well written, the author is obviously a good, modern programmer.\n\nThe sliders are custom 'tags', the slider images are custom posts (I think). Strange is, that you have to supply a 'Featured Image' and an image link for each slide, then it works - slides shown in the order of their creation. Just change the creation date to modify the order (untried).\n\nOne thing I found not so obvious in the UI at first: On hover over the slider then a 'paused' icon is displayed top left and the slider is indeed paused. As soon as the mouse goes away, the icon disappears and the animation continues. But at first I thought the paused icon was a button to click to <em>cause<\/em> a pause, and since it did not I thought the plugin was broken. Silly me, but perhaps there is a way to do it even more clearly?\n\nIt is now live on the homepage of a german apothecary.\n\nBTW minimalists might want to pair this with WP Featherlight as a lightbox.\n\n5 stars really well earned - thanks Jonathan!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/no-bs-image-slider.1.8.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"accessible":"accessible","carousel":"carousel","responsive":"responsive","slideshow":"slideshow"},"versions":{"1.7.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/no-bs-image-slider.1.7.1.zip","1.8":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/no-bs-image-slider.1.8.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/no-bs-image-slider.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/planetjon.ca","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/no-bs-image-slider\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2337692","high":false}}
