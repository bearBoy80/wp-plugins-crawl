It&#8217;s necessary to sign up to our service (the registration process can be done in the plugin itself), because we create individual accounts for each user in order to be able to assign each created video project to the right user. All the videos and files you upload in our plugin are uploaded onto our servers (which are located in Germany). We will never share these files with a third party (to read more about data privacy protection, please read our terms of service).<\/p>\n<p>During the registration process, we&#8217;ll ask for your eMail address (don&#8217;t worry we won&#8217;t spam you), name, surname and you have to set a password. With these credentials you can then login to the video editor plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Our WordPress Plugin enables you to transform your own videos recorded with smartphone, webcam, digicam or even professional equipment with only a few clicks into ready made, edited, branded as well as optimized video clips. Feel free to use the final videos on your blog, website, Youtube, Twitter, Facebook or any other source of your choice. Like in WordPress you can easily choose your preferred and modified layout for your videos.<\/p>\n<p>Watch these videos to learn how you can create videos with VINUBIS:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/S90o7pmyEZo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The Full Editor<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/uoj6hyXlXKM\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The One Shot<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/XphlqxAnYZk\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The Highlight<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLs7Dc0kPI3YBuw3MwBhqI44HXAy-ul9Nh\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Video Styles \/ Video Themes<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Extra Notes<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>You can use all common devices (e.g. your smartphone or webcam)<\/li>\n<li>You keep all rights on your media at any time<\/li>\n<li>You do not need extra webspace for hosting the videos on your provider.<\/li>\n<li>You can use the videos everywhere you decide to (e.g. youtube, your blog, vimeo, &#8230;)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/vinubis-video-editor<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Call the menu &#8220;VINUBIS Editor&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>If you do not have an account so far just register for free!<\/li>\n<li>You can immediately start creating videos by clicking on &#8220;My Videos&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Installation Instructions<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/vinubis-video-editor<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Call the menu &#8220;VINUBIS Editor&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>If you do not have an account so far just register for free!<\/li>\n<li>You can immediately start creating videos by clicking on &#8220;My Videos&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is the plugin free to use?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it is.
