However, I would love for the plugin to also offer an ultimate feature that would allow users to subscribe globally and access all courses without having to make payments for each individual course. If this were added, it would be a fantastic addition to make this plugin even more useful and user-friendly.&#8221; &#8211; By <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/eyescream49\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">eyescream49<\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8220;This is my first LMS plugin. At the beginning I have more problems, but all of them were solved with the kind costumer service. For me, with a small webshop and with my first online course, it&#8217;s awesome. Easy to handle, and if I have any question they answer me soon. I recommended it to everybody who need a great LMS with a great support!&#8221; &#8211; By <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/fityircvagyok\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">fityircvagyok<\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Get in Touch with Us<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/masteriyo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook Group<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/masteriyolms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twitter<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@masteriyolms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">YouTube<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Explore More Products from Our Team<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of Masteriyo, you&#8217;ll definitely love our other WordPress themes and plugins as well.
