Or it can say an advertisement.<\/p>\n<p>This can be especially true for web design or development sites or if your site just plain rocks, as often people like to take a look at the page source to see how was something done or what plugins were used. This ads just a little extra touch of coolness that might persuade them to actually give you that call. Of course there are ton?s of fonts and you can customize is the way you want.<\/p>\n<p>Plugin by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prelovac.com\/vladimir\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Vladimir Prelovac<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Credits<\/h3>\n<p>WP Figlet is based on Figlet (www.figlet.org) and Figlet PHP class (www.thebobo.com), the classical ASCII art program.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks.<\/p>\n<h3>License<\/h3>\n<p>This file is part of WP Figlet.<\/p>\n<p>WP Figlet is free software: you can redistribute it and\/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<\/p>\n<p>WP Figlet is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
