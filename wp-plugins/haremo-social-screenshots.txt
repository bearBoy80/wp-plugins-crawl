By running this plugin, you simply need to include the URL in a Facebook post and nothing else. The image will be generated automatically. You don\u2019t have to do anything else! After installing, this plugin will produce screenshot thumbnails for every WordPress page or blog entry that you provide as a link in a Facebook post. These screenshots will later be used as the thumbnail image on Facebook.<br \/>\nYou don&#8217;t need to do anything, simply include the link in your post!<\/p>\n<h4>Why Use HAREMO Social Screenshots Plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>A picture is worth a thousand words. Today\u2019s Facebook users want to know what type of content they\u2019re going to view before they click a link, and Facebook urges content creators to follow best practices of creating content that can be easily shared with Open Graph images. However, we\u2019ve taken the guesswork out of creating images to their recomendations. The plugin does it all for you, and you won\u2019t have to download your images, attach to your post, and then share &#8211; it\u2019s an easy, streamlined process and it\u2019s free!<br \/>\nWe hope HAREMO Social Screenshots Plugin can help you share your content in a way that is more accessible and attractive to your readers.<\/p>\n<h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>Each screenshot of your Articles and Pages has a corresponding screenshot that is generated on a Remote Server.<br \/>\nWe use the URL of your page and send it to our API (located at (api.social-screenshots.haremo.de) to create the screenshot from your content. From there, the Screenshot sends back a link with the image file, and is automatically used by Facebook as the Open Graph image tag.<\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>Installing the plugin is easy and only takes a few minutes.<\/h4>\n<p>You can either upload the downloaded plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory or install it through the WordPress Plugins screen (Plugins &gt; Add New) once you find it in the directory of plugins.<br \/>\nOnce installed, Activate the plugin on the Plugins screen.<br \/>\nAfter that, you\u2019re done! There are no Settings to adjust. The Plugin will create the screenshots, and let the Facebook users see a small picture of each Article and Page.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Are the screenshots created automatically?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The screenshots are created each time you post an Article or Page on your WordPress website.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is this plugin for WordPress.com users?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, as WordPress.com does not permit Plugins. You may only use this Plugin on a self-hosted or WordPress.org website.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I installed the Plugin but I don&#8217;t see any pictures<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Depending on how many Articles and Pages you have in WordPress, it can take a few minutes to produce the screenshots.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Does the Plugin cost anything?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<p>initial version of the plugin<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/haremo-social-screenshots\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1451820\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/haremo-social-screenshots\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1451820\" alt=\"This is an example of what the Facebook reader when you share a link.
