A free and easy to use plugin saving you time working in WordPress.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h4>Your benefits<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can delete menu items in a 1-click process instead of opening the menu item panel.<\/li>\n<li>You can move the menu items in 1-click process without opening the panel.<\/li>\n<li>You see via icons on the left sidebar if a page, post, category etc. is already used in the current menu.<\/li>\n<li>You see the used menu items by hovering over the items in the left sidebar.<\/li>\n<li>You have the possibility to do quick inserts of menu items, where you can place them at the position you like.<\/li>\n<li>You can modify the behavior of inserting\/moving elements downwards.<\/li>\n<li>It shows you additionally the original name of a menu item on the outer level like in the opened panel.<\/li>\n<li>Saves you a lot of time by reducing clicks not needed to work with the menu items in the backend.<\/li>\n<li>It\u00b4s free and easy to use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Different behaviors<\/h4>\n<p>Inserting\/moving menu items downwards is enriched by two new behaviors. Moving\/inserting rightwards, upwards is the same as provided by WordPress.<br \/>\nLeftwards moving\/inserting is a special case. The leftwards functionality is nearly the same as provided by WordPress expect the scenario when<br \/>\nthe menu item becomes a menu parent and create a submenu by moving one step left.<br \/>\nThe different behaviors can be seen in the <strong><em>Screenshots section<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h4>Same-level behavior<\/h4>\n<p>When choosing this behavior menu items will be inserted\/moved after submenus. The default behavior provided by WordPress inserts\/moves the menu item into the submenu.<br \/>\nIf you move\/insert a menu item and the next menu item is the parent of a submenu it will stay on the same level, but the position is after the submenu.<\/p>\n<h4>Take-children elements behavior<\/h4>\n<p>When choosing this behavior menu items will become new submenu parents when inserted\/moved if they would become the parent of the submenu children elements.<br \/>\nThis is true for downwards\/leftwards moving\/inserting.<\/p>\n<h4>Quick insert multiple menu items<\/h4>\n<p>It can be very handy to insert multiple menu items to a specific menu element to create a submenu.<\/p>\n<h4>Compatible<\/h4>\n<p>The plugin is compatible with a multisite setup.<\/p>\n<h3>Future roadmap &amp; wishlist<\/h3>\n<p>By future updates the plugin\u00b4s functionality will be enriched.<br \/>\nIf you have any suggestion please hit me an <a href=\"mailto:konstk.wp@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">email<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Contribute<\/h3>\n<p>Want to help improve the plugin feel free to submit PRs via Bitbucket <a href=\"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/konstk\/simplify-menu-usage\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Quick and easy installation:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the folder <code>simplify-menu-usage<\/code> to your plugin directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>That\u00b4s it!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>\nHow to get started?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin provides the functionality for existing menus.
