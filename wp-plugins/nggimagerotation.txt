It looks too much like a blog were her exact words.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of a list of thumbnails, she wanted a large image with thumbnails at the bottom. Click the thumbnail, and it updates the large image. She has 200+ images in the gallery.<\/p>\n<p>I found the nggGalleryView plugin which looks like what was desired. The thumbnails were a little small, but I was able to modify that with CSS. The image was resized in an odd way resulting in low image quality. The wrong CSS was in place, which I was able to correct.<\/p>\n<p>The main problem with nggGalleryView is that it loads all the images at one time. So, if there is a gallery with 200+ images it slows down the browser with the sheer volume of information that it is processing all at one time.<\/p>\n<p>So I did some digging and found that NextGEN Gallery for WordPress has a ?carrousel? view that looks very much like what was desired. You can use it with this builtin WordPress shortcode:<\/p>\n<p>[nggallery id=x template=carousel images=7]<\/p>\n<p>The problem with this is there is no AJAX. In essence, every time you click to do something, the page reloads.<\/p>\n<p>This is a custom module to extend NextGEN Gallery with a custom view that places the thumbnails in the left column, places a large image in the right column, and updates the large image with AJAX.<\/p>\n<p>Usage:<br \/>\n[nggallery id=1 template=&#8221;imagerotation&#8221;]<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Install the NextGEN Gallery plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Upload the <code>nggImageRotation<\/code> directory to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Place the shortcode <code>[nggallery id=1 template=\"imagerotation\"]<\/code> in your templates<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>How can I customize the look<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently you can edit the file view.css in the nggImageRotation directory, or submit a feature request to the author at this link:<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/www.prositebuilder.com\/contact-us\/<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/nggimagerotation\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1559360\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/nggimagerotation\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1559360\" alt=\"\"><\/a><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/nggimagerotation.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/nggimagerotation\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1559360","caption":""}},"tags":{"image-display":"image display","image-gallery":"image gallery","nextgen-gallery-addon":"NextGEN Gallery addon","photo-gallery":"photo gallery"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/nggimagerotation.1.0.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.prositebuilder.com\/donation-thanks\/","banners":[]}
