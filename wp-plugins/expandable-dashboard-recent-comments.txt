The &#8220;Show more&#8221; link, when clicked, will replace the excerpt with the full comment. The full comment will include all markup, including originally utilized markup and changes applied via filters, plugins, etc (such as shortcode expansion, smilies, paragraphing, etc). The full comment can be switched back to the excerpt by clicking the &#8220;Show less&#8221; link (which replaces the &#8220;Show more&#8221; link when the comment is expanded).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In-place expansion&#8221; refers to the ability to click the link to see the full comment and it will be presented in place of the excerpt without requiring a page reload or navigation.<\/p>\n<p><em>NOTE:<\/em> This plugin only works for users who have JavaScript enabled.<\/p>\n<p>Links: <a href=\"https:\/\/coffee2code.com\/wp-plugins\/expandable-dashboard-recent-comments\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugin Homepage<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/expandable-dashboard-recent-comments\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Plugin Directory Page<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/coffee2code\/expandable-dashboard-recent-comments\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/coffee2code.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Author Homepage<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Hooks<\/h3>\n<p>The plugin exposes one filter for hooking.
