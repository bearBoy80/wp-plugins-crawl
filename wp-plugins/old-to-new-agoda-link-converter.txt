They even allow it to place links in the very first paragraphs, on your home page, and in bolded text. It also misfires and creates broken links from partial text that belong to bigger words. Our favorite was linking to a non-existent Agoda page from \"Fest\" in the word Festival...every time it was mentioned in the post. We switched to 1 link and that seemed fine until we discovered that if we wanted to change the plugins chosen link to a different one that it's impossible to do so within the post edit page. It doesn't show that there is a link in the edit area whatsoever. It's either take what they give you or nothing. Our site is now also running extremely slow since making the update and sometimes timing out altogether. It's clear it adds some extra load to every page. I'm worried that the damage is done even after I deactivate the plugin. There isn't enough documentation discussing how limited this plugin is.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1691008","caption":"Plugin settings panel can be found under <strong>Agoda Site Configuration<\/strong>"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1691008","caption":""}},"tags":{"accommodation":"accommodation","agoda":"agoda","agoda-com":"Agoda.com","agoda-com-plugin":"Agoda.com plugin","search-hotels":"search hotels"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.1.zip","1.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.2.zip","1.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.3.zip","1.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.4.zip","1.4.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.4.2.zip","1.4.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.4.3.zip","1.4.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.4.4.zip","1.4.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.4.5.zip","1.6":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.6.zip","1.6.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.6.5.zip","1.6.5.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.6.5.1.zip","1.6.5.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.6.5.2.zip","1.6.5.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.6.5.3.zip","1.7.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.7.0.zip","1.7.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter.1.7.1.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=1692274","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/old-to-new-agoda-link-converter\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=1692274"}}
