It's simple to use and all my ebay orders and web orders are now managed within woocommerce.  I don't have to manually type in any of the address info as it pulls this in from the orders and the dimensions of my products are automatically populated too.  I can get a courier label within a few seconds now.  Well done, great plugin.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce.1.0.5.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=1906252","caption":"An overview of the collection and delivery address input screen"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=1906252","caption":"Obtain costs from mutiple carriers with transparent pricing"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=1906252","caption":"Select collection dates or drop your parcel off"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=1906252","caption":"Return a tracking number automatically when the service has been booked"}},"tags":{"delivery":"delivery","freight":"freight","logistics":"logistics","parcel-delivery":"parcel delivery","shipping":"shipping"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce.1.0.0.zip","1.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce.1.0.1.zip","1.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce.1.0.2.zip","1.0.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce.1.0.3.zip","1.0.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce.1.0.4.zip","1.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce.1.0.5.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1906252","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/parcelbroker-for-woocommerce\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1906252"}}
