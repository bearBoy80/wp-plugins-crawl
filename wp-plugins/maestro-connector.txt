Keeping track of usernames, passwords, themes, plugins, patches, and updates across a fleet of websites often requires a variety of software, tools, and dashboards. So many moving parts can quickly become time-consuming and deplete you of your efficiency and take precious time away from helping you expand your business.<\/p>\n<p>Bluehost\u2019s Maestro platform is designed to help the modern Web Pro organize their web development business on a single dashboard, so that they can focus on their clients and growing their business, without the administrative overheads.<\/p>\n<p>With the Maestro account, you can organize your clients and their WordPress sites onto a single dashboard, and get one-click access to the WP Admin of all the sites you manage. You no longer need to log in separately into each of your clients sites &#8211; a secure one-click login to WP Admin allows you to quickly access multiple sites from a central hub, making it easier to track, develop, design and update.<\/p>\n<p>Your Maestro account is free, and is separate from any existing account you might have with Bluehost.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Install the plugin by clicking <code>Add New<\/code> on the Plugins screen in your WordPress admin, then searching for &#8220;Maestro&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Enter the secret key for the Maestro platform provided to you by your Web Pro.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20host%20my%20site%20with%20bluehost%20to%20use%20maestro%3F'>\nDo I have to host my site with Bluehost to use Maestro?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No! In fact, that is what this plugin is for. It allows you to connect your sites hosted anywhere to the Bluehost Maestro platform.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20access%20am%20i%20giving%20to%20the%20web%20pro%20through%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat access am I giving to the Web Pro through this plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will be giving your Web Pro Administrator privileges to your website.

Click on \u2018All Users\u2019. You will see a list of users who have access to your WordPress Admin. The Web Pros to whom you have granted Administrator access via the Maestro Connector plugin will appear with the Bluehost Maestro tag under the Maestro column. Hover over the tag to see the \u201cRevoke Access\u201d button. Clicking on this will demote the Web Pro to a Subscriber to your WordPress Admin and disconnect from the Maestro platform. The Web Pro will no longer be able to access your WordPress admin dashboard.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Move the maestro functionalities to wp-module-maestro<\/li>\n<li>Add theme management APIs<\/li>\n<li>Add plugin management APIs<\/li>\n<li>Add wordpress management APIs in conjunction with bluehost plugin for managing auto-updates etc.<\/li>\n<li>Add a WP-CLI command to associate a web pro with the association key.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add support for a bounce parameter on SSO logins<\/li>\n<li>Fix bug preventing reconnecting after revoking<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix bug preventing approval of Web Pro connections<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix bug in response for DELETE REST API endpoint<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Intial version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/maestro-connector\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2283381\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/maestro-connector\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2283381\" alt=\"\"><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/maestro-connector\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2283381\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/maestro-connector\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2283381\" alt=\"\"><\/a><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Web pros must purchase hosting plan to access clients&#039; cPanel, etc.<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/sczimmerman\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e415b0fbd4ff2b47069758b0f4bb8c65?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e415b0fbd4ff2b47069758b0f4bb8c65?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/sczimmerman\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Steve Zimmerman <small>(sczimmerman)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 1, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I'm a freelance developer, WP admin, and SEO, and I have a roster of clients using several different web hosts. All of these hosts allow their customers to delegate access to their hosting account. No add-on products or extra \"Maestro\" plugins required. I just create an account with the host, <strong>without purchasing anything<\/strong>, and my clients can delegate access to that account so that I can manage things like cPanel and DNS configuration without access to their billing information. Bluehost, however, doesn't allow account creation without purchasing a hosting plan! Just go to their site and try to create an account. The first screen you'll encounter requires you to select a hosting plan. There is no option to create an account without purchasing a plan. This is way out of step what most hosts offer. It also costs my client money due to the extra time I have to spend doing things the hard way. He knows this, and will be changing hosts as soon as his plan is up, and maybe before. I often recommend hosts to my clients, and will never recommend (and will strongly discourage) Bluehost. If I'm misunderstanding something, I'd love to be corrected (it would make my life easier), but Bluehost's support has now told me this three times in the last year. Awful.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">It just works!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/spiffysax\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/5eb8de621ccf5c9a84729627bb686f5f?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/5eb8de621ccf5c9a84729627bb686f5f?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/spiffysax\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">TraderHowell <small>(SpiffySax)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 10, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Maestro has made managing my ever growing list of client sites easier than ever.
