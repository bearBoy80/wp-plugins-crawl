Since the password is automatically generated and emailed to the user, this allows for sign-up form with a single form field: email.<\/p>\n<p>For users that registered with different username and email address before this plugin was installed, their username and email address will be interchangeable on login.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin offers a shortcode, [NP-registration], to add the registration form to a post or page.<\/p>\n<p>Note: This plugin has not been tested with WP versions older than to 3.1.5. It should work with some older versions, but we can not guarantee it. However, if you are running an older version of WordPress, there are some very compelling arguments why you should consider upgrading.
