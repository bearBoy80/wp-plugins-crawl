Wagering requirements of a bonus can lead to negative experience with the casino. Thus, players may not get their winnings from the bonus. The calculator helps to prevent problems with withdrawal of bonus winnings by calculating the exact wagering amount a player must bet. The calculator comprises two types of bonus: match deposit bonus and free bonus.<br \/>\nFor the right use of the plugin, an external JavaScript file at https:\/\/casinobest.ca\/wp-content\/plugins\/mga\/js\/mga-calc.js is used. The JavaScript file processes the data users type in the calculator at the moment of use, but the data isn\u2019t further kept in a specific storage file.<br \/>\nView demo: https:\/\/casinobest.ca\/wagering-requirement-calculator\/<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>To install the plugin, use the shortcode [mgacalcshort] in the text.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='a%20question%20that%20someone%20might%20have'>\nA question that someone might have\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>How can the calculator help me?<\/p>\n<p>By using the calculator, players can find out what exact amount of money they will have to wager on games before they can withdraw their winnings.
