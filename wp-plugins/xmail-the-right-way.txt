You will probably share an email server with many other users, and if these users are unscrupulous and send out SPAM, you will suffer as well because the main server IP you use will lose credibility and become untrusted by the email providers named above. This will result in your emails never reaching your users&#8217; inboxes.<br \/>\nHowever, some website servers have an option to send out emails from the main IP, but only SMTP allows for this. STMP is an email setup enabled by the Xmail plugin.<br \/>\nShould that option be incompatible, the only thing left is to use the MX method which does not rely on any other service in the server. It&#8217;s pure PHP and will always use your site&#8217;s IP. This MX method is also enabled by the Xmail plugin.<br \/>\nNote: You should also contact your hosting provider and ask him to activate Domain Keys and SPF for your domain.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.00<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.01<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested and set to work starting WP 3.0 UP<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.03<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added SIZE transmision<\/li>\n<li>Added redundancy to mail() if socket fails<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.04<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed SIZE transmision cause most servers do not support it<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.05<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested and working on WP 3.3.1<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.10<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed headers received as array<\/li>\n<li>Standardized line endings<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixez<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/xmail-the-right-way\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2662601\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/xmail-the-right-way\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2662601\" alt=\"Behind the mailing system.\"><\/a><p>Behind the mailing system.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/xmail-the-right-way.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/xmail-the-right-way\/trunk\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2662601","caption":"Behind the mailing system."}},"tags":{"email":"email","mail":"mail","smtp":"smtp","spam":"spam","wp_mail":"wp_mail"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
