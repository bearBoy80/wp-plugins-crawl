I bought the pro version of Better Links when it launched because it seemed promising and Pretty Link was so seldom updated. It seemed to have some advantages over Pretty Link, but as a new plugin was not yet at feature parity overall. The developer\/owner promised updates, but years later no new features have been added and the product is still buggy. It has essentially been abandoned after the owner's windfall profit-making launch. I wouldn't be surprised if this is the case with all of his plugins. Avoid.
