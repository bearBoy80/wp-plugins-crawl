It adds a block named &#8216;Gist Embed&#8217; to the WordPress editor interface. For every instance of this block, you can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select one or more files from the same Gist URL to be embedded in your post.<\/li>\n<li>Include the vendor stylesheet that handles the styling of Gist embeds (see the FAQ for more information).<\/li>\n<li>Choose whether or not to embed the Gist files as raw content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Roadmap<\/h3>\n<p>We would like to bring some additional features soon. Some of the things we have planned, are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Caching the content of files<\/li>\n<li>Manually change the order of the files from a Gist within a block<\/li>\n<li>Automatically get the list of files after a valid Gist URL is entered in the input field<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/ff-block-gist-embed<\/code> directory of your site or blog, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Can I embed multiple Gist files from the same block?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. However, this plugin lists all the files from the same Gist in the same order as on gist.github.com. If you need to list files in a different order than on gist.github.com, use multiple Gist Embed blocks.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Do Gist embeds get the correct styling automatically?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, <strong>Gist Embed<\/strong> is configured to load vendor stylesheets for Gist embeds (each Gist comes packed with CSS that handles the styling for the embed containers on the frontend).<br \/>\nYou can select whether or not to load vendor stylesheets for each Gist Embed block by (un)checking the &#8216;Include stylesheet&#8217; checkbox in the sidebar menu (see the screenshots).<br \/>\n<strong>Please note<\/strong>: this checkbox is checked by default for each Gist Embed block. Performance-wise, it is advised to uncheck this checkbox for all but one of the Gist Embed blocks on the same post.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I embed raw files from Gists?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is an option to embed the checked file(s) from the Gist Embed block as raw content in the sidebar (unchecked by default).<br \/>\nBy checking this checkbox, the content from each checked file is loaded as raw content instead of embedded in a Gist embed container. This could be useful for HTML prototypes, for example.<br \/>\nNote that if you check this checkbox, the vendor stylesheet is never loaded for this block.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Does this plugin support block alignment options?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Provided your active theme supports the &#8216;wide&#8217; and &#8216;full&#8217; alignment options, you can configure each block to <em>align wide<\/em> or take up the full width. The CSS classes that are added, are <code>alignwide<\/code> and <code>alignfull<\/code>, respectively. Your theme should already apply the correct styling for these classes.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolve possible errors displayed if block is used but no Gist URL is entered.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the first file of the Gist by default. If a Gist contains only one file, the checkbox for that file is disabled.<\/li>\n<li>Correctly list the files of a Gist when the GitHub username contains dashes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This is our first release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ff-block-gist-embed\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2079796\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ff-block-gist-embed\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2079796\" alt=\"&lt;strong&gt;Gist Embed&lt;\/strong&gt; is found under the &#039;Embeds&#039; section in the &#039;Add block&#039; dialog.\"><\/a><p><strong>Gist Embed<\/strong> is found under the 'Embeds' section in the 'Add block' dialog.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ff-block-gist-embed\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2079796\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/ff-block-gist-embed\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2079796\" alt=\"You can enter (or more likely, copy-paste) a Gist URL.
