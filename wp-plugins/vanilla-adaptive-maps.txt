Users w\/ larger screens will get a full map in an iframe.<\/p>\n<p>No styling has been provided, but the link and map are wrapped in <code>div.adaptive-map<\/code>.<\/p>\n<h3>Credits<\/h3>\n<p>All props to <a href=\"http:\/\/bradfrostweb.com\/blog\/post\/adaptive-maps\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Brad Frost<\/a> who presented the idea quite a while ago.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>vanilla-adaptive-maps<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>To use, write a shortcode like this: <code>[vamap addr=\"1203 Pearl St, Boulder, CO 80302\"]<\/code><\/p>\n<p>To include a responsive map in a theme template, write the following PHP:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode('[vamap addr=\"1203 Pearl St, Boulder, CO 80302\"]'); ?&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n","faq":"\n<h4>What is the breakpoint between mobile and desktop?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Right now, the breakpoint is set at 550px, which was the default in Brad\u2019s model, and seems reasonable to me.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I change the breakpoint for switching from mobile to desktop?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, although you\u2019ll have to modify the plugin. Open <code>vanilla-adaptive-maps.php<\/code> and look for <code>set_breakpoint<\/code>. You can change the number there.<\/p>\n<p>Right now we are only supporting a pixel-based breakpoint.
