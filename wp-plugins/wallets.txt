Every day new security vulnerabilities are found involving WordPress plugins. Since WordPress is such a popular software platform, it gets a lot of attention from hackers.<\/p>\n<p>Take an immediate backup of the site, and the server it runs on, if possible. This will preserve any traces that the hackers may have left behind. Funds theft is a crime and you can report it to the police, just like any other hack.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s best if you are prepared beforehand: Keep the software on the site updated regularly. Take the time to harden your server and WordPress installation. Try to use only reputable plugins on your site and keep them updated.  Use a security plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, only keep a small percentage of the user balances on the hot wallet, utilizing the <em>Cold storage<\/em> feature to transfer the remaining funds to offline wallets. That way, in case WordPress is compromised, you don&#8217;t lose all your users&#8217; funds! Please take wallet management seriously. There is no software that will automatically do opsec for you. Have a plan on how to act in case of theft.<\/p>\n<p>If you think you have discovered a security vulnerability in this plugin, please let me know over email (not on a public forum).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20become%20a%20premium%20member%20and%20get%20access%20to%20the%20app%20extensions%3F'>\nHow can I become a premium member and get access to the app extensions?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Paying members can download the available <em>App extensions<\/em> and can download updates to those extensions.<\/p>\n<p>Study the available <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dashed-slug.net\/dashed-slug\/membership-plans\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Membership plans<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20payment%20methods%20are%20available'>\nWhat payment methods are available\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The site accepts Bitcoin and Ethereum.

This is necessary for the upcoming Taproot Assets Wallet Adapter.<\/li>\n<li>Improve: If cron jobs are not running, the warning message in the admin screens now links to the relevant documentation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.10<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Fixed issue where the PHP curl library would not return meaningful error messages to the admin user in case of connection failures.<\/li>\n<li>Add: When actions are initiated via the frontend UIs by clicking a button, the button is now animated until the action completes. Additionally, the actions are performed asynchronously for a better user experience.<\/li>\n<li>Remove: Duplicate display of Confirmation link in withdrawal transactions is now removed. The Confirmation link is shown once at the top left part of the screen.<\/li>\n<li>Remove: The &#8220;post slug&#8221; metaboxes are not useful and have been removed from the following CPTs: Wallets, Currencies, Addresses, Transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Remove: The plugin&#8217;s CPTs are no longer available to be added to frontend menus, since the posts themselves are only useful in the backend.<\/li>\n<li>Add: The PHP templates now come with a warning about not editing the templates in-place. The warning links to the documentation where the admin can learn more about this.<\/li>\n<li>Add: Troubleshooting section in documentation now has more information on how to restore the <code>manage_wallets<\/code> capability to the admin user.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Silly syntax errors introduced right before summer vacation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add: New setting allows for deposits to be ignored if they have a timestamp earlier than a set cutoff value.<\/li>\n<li>Add: When initiating an addresses and balances-only migration, the deposit cutoff value is set to the current timestamp.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Issue introduced in 6.1.6 which prevented admin transaction editing is now fixed.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: If you have setup walletnotify for Bitcoin core and similar wallets, the notification API is now disabled while migration is underway.<\/li>\n<li>Change: The <code>walletnotify<\/code> and <code>blocknotify<\/code> WP-REST API endpoints associated with Bitcoin core and similar wallets now returns uniform error messages. The HTTP status is not always 200, but reflects the error that was encountered. The value of the returned <code>status<\/code> field is no longer success\/error but is the HTTP response code, which is 200 when the call was successful.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Change: In the plugin&#8217;s general settings, the maximum deposit address limit is now applied per user and per currency. Was previously applied per user only over all currencies.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: When listing transactions in the admin screens, if the associated currency has block explorer URIs, these are now used to link addresses and TXIDs to a block explorer.<\/li>\n<li>Add: New filter <code>wallets_tags_exclude_min_withdraw<\/code> allows a currency&#8217;s minimum withdrawal amount to not apply to transactions with the specified tags. This will allow the upcoming lnd extension to bypass this restriction for Layer2 transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Improve: Transactions that are not modified will no longer be re-written to the DB. This improves performance, plus it allows the last modified timestamp to remain intact in case of no actual modification of transaction data.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: The new mechanism for detecting whether a camera is available for scanning QR-Codes, introduced in <code>6.1.4<\/code>, was buggy and is now fixed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Usage of words &#8220;debit&#8221; and &#8220;credit&#8221; is now correct according to how the terms are used in everyday language, as opposed to their usage in accounting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Shortcode <code>[wallets_fiat_withdraw]<\/code> does not submit withdrawal requests with invalid amount.<\/li>\n<li>Add: Shortcode <code>[wallets_fiat_withdraw]<\/code> now accepts atttributes: <code>currency_id<\/code>, <code>symbol<\/code> to specify the default currency.<\/li>\n<li>Add: New WP-REST API endpoint <code>\/users\/U\/currencies\/C<\/code> for retrieving a single currency <code>C<\/code> and the balances of user <code>U<\/code> for that currency.<\/li>\n<li>Improve: Added a new withdrawal check: It is now impossible for a withdrawal to be executed as long as it has a TXID assigned. If you need to repeat execution, you must clear the TXID.<\/li>\n<li>Improve: The <code>[wallets_withdraw]<\/code> UI now uses a <code>getUserMedia()<\/code> call to determine if a camera is available to scan QR-Codes. Previous method using CSS media queries was not optimal.<\/li>\n<li>Improve: The included copy of <code>moment.js<\/code> is now upgraded to version <code>2.29.4<\/code>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Setting the <code>currency_id<\/code> attribute on the <code>[wallets_deposit]<\/code> shortcode now works again.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Listing the addresses of a specific user now works again.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Listing the addresses of a specific type (deposits, withdrawals) now works again.<\/li>\n<li>Improve: The transactions editor now loads faster on sites with many thousands of users. The user dropdown is replaced with an text input where you type a <code>user_login<\/code> and it autocompletes with AJAX.<\/li>\n<li>Improve: It is now possible to search addresses by keyword, and the keyword is matched against the address title AND the address string.<\/li>\n<li>Add: Addresses with the <code>archived<\/code> tag will not be shown in the REST API and frontend. This will be useful for the Lightning adapter later, among other things.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Issue with editing transactions in admin when system holds too many transactions is now fixed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Issue with transactions search in admin is now fixed.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: When editing wallet adapter settings, it is now possible to uncheck boxes for boolean values.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add: New option &#8220;Admin must approve withdrawals&#8221;. When on, pending withdrawals must be approved by an admin in the Transactions list screen using the &#8220;Approve&#8221; batch action.<\/li>\n<li>Add: The frontend &#8220;VS amounts&#8221;, i.e. the equivalent amounts expressed in &#8220;VS currencies&#8221;, are now shown with a number of decimals that is configurable by the admin.<\/li>\n<li>Add: Admin can now search transactions by TXID.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Admin can now search for cancelled or failed transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: When filtering posts, all enabled filters are now shown in bold and with ARIA accessibility attributes.<\/li>\n<li>Add: For pending withdrawals, admin can view the results of withdrawal pre-checks.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Daily withdrawal counters for currencies are now correctly enforced at all times.<\/li>\n<li>Add: Daily withdrawal counters are now visible in the profile screen of each user.<\/li>\n<li>Add: For pending withdrawals, developer can add withdrawal pre-checks with action <code>wallets_withdrawal_pre_check<\/code> and with filter <code>wallets_withdrawals_pre_check<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: When showing <code>[wallets_account_value]<\/code> shortcode without any enabled &#8220;VS currencies&#8221;, the account value is now shown as &#8216;?&#8217; and not &#8216;Undefined ?&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Documentation updated to reflect changes in premium plugin payment method and added mention to new Paywall extension.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Improved logging for wallet adapters cron task.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Added guard clause in currency icons cron task to protect against missing returned data from remote service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Change: Sourcecode rewritten from scratch and modernized for PHP7.x compatibility: Namespaces, callbacks, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Change: Coin adapters removed and replaced with wallet adapters. Wallet adapters are a more versatile abstraction of external wallets.<\/li>\n<li>Change: All amounts stored on the DB are now stored as integers. This avoids FP\/rounding errors, but requires the admin to specify the number of decimals on a Currency explicitly.<\/li>\n<li>Add: Wallets now have their own CPT and editor screen. Connection information for wallet APIs is now decoupled from currency details.<\/li>\n<li>Add: Currencies now have their own CPT and editor screen. Currency details are now decoupled from wallet connection information details.<\/li>\n<li>Change: Currencies are no longer identified by their ticker symbol, since these can clash. Currencies are now uniquely identified by their post ID.<\/li>\n<li>Change: Transactions now have their own CPT and editor screen. Transactions are no longer stored in custom SQL tables, but are stored as posts.<\/li>\n<li>Add: If a transaction is saved without a comment, a basic comment is entered as a title.<\/li>\n<li>Change: Addresses now have their own CPT and editor screen. Addresses are no longer stored in custom SQL tables, but are stored as posts.<\/li>\n<li>Add: When creating a new address, if admin sets the address string empty, a new address string is created from the wallet.<\/li>\n<li>Add: Currencies, Transactions and Addresses can be organized via tags. These are implemented as WordPress custom taxonomies.<\/li>\n<li>Add: When listing Wallets, these can be filtered by Wallet Adapter type.<\/li>\n<li>Add: When listing Currencies, these can be filtered by associated Wallet or Currency tag.<\/li>\n<li>Add: When listing Transactions, these can be filtered by Currency, User, Type (deposit\/withdaw\/move), Status (pending, done, cancelled, failed), or Transaction tag.<\/li>\n<li>Add: When listing Addresses, these can be filtered by Currency, User, Type (deposit\/withdaw\/move), Status (pending, done, cancelled, failed), or Transaction tag.<\/li>\n<li>Add: When editing Wallets, Currencies, Transactions, or Addresses, there are now metaboxes that let an admin easily jump between associated CPTs. For example, can click a link to go from a Currency to the Transactions of that Currency.<\/li>\n<li>Add: A new &#8220;Migration&#8221; tool helps users transfer balances from the old custom SQL tables to the new format. Please study the documentation for details.<\/li>\n<li>Add: A new Object-Oriented way to create and manipulate Wallets, Currencies, Addresses and Transactions. Lots of example code snippets included in the docs and PHPdocumentor files.<\/li>\n<li>Add: A documented library of helper functions can be used by PHP developers to interface with the plugin. This lives in the <code>DSWallets<\/code> namespace.<\/li>\n<li>Change: The old PHP-API is renamed as &#8220;Legacy PHP-API&#8221;, but not removed. Only the <code>wallets_api_adapters<\/code> filter is removed, since there are no more Coin Adapters.<\/li>\n<li>Add: A new cron job scheduler that runs jobs based on priorities. Can be triggerred externally to improve site performance.<\/li>\n<li>Add: New email queue system based on cron, handles large volumes of outgoing emails by sending them in batches.<\/li>\n<li>Add: New cron job that iterates over defined currencies and pulls icons\/logos from CoinGecko when possible. Adds images to the WordPress media collection, and sets the logo as Currency featured image. Admin can override the featured image.<\/li>\n<li>Change: All the plugin&#8217;s settings are now placed under the <em>Settings<\/em> menu, and organized in tabs. Extensions, when installed, add tabs to the settings screen.<\/li>\n<li>Change: Capability settings are now in a settings tab. The existing capabilities are retained. It is also possible to edit the capabilities related to the new CPTs (Wallets, Currencies, Addresses, Transactions).<\/li>\n<li>Add: Fiat currencies are now created automatically by a cron job when you enter a fixer.io API key. Fiat currencies can be associated to the built-in wallet adapter that handles manual Bank transfers. The Fiat Coin Adapter extension is removed.<\/li>\n<li>Change: It is now possible to define any number of Bitcoin-like wallets and currencies without any plugin extensions. The Full Node MultiCoin Adapter extension is removed.<\/li>\n<li>Change: The UIs are now self-contained. All the HTML markup, knockout.js attributes, JavaScript code, and CSS rules are encapsulated within the template files, and are overridable.<\/li>\n<li>Change: The UIs are now rendered independently. This improves frontend performance. If one UI crashes, the remaining UIs continue to work.<\/li>\n<li>Remove: There are no more static templates. All templates are dynamic. This reduces confusion about how templates work.<\/li>\n<li>Add: Currencies can be used by users even if not associated with a Wallet, or if the wallet API is unreachable. If wallet API is unreachable, only deposits and withdrawals will not be available, but on-site transactions are still possible.<\/li>\n<li>Add: New shortcode <code>[wallets_status]<\/code> informes users if a wallet is online.<\/li>\n<li>Change: The exchange rates mechanism now relies on CoinGecko. If the admin provides the CoinGecko ID for a Currency, the exchange rates are retrieved automatically via cron.<\/li>\n<li>Improve: In the Currency editor, if a currency is not associated with a CoinGecko ID, it is still possible for an admin to setup a fixed exchange rate for a currency.<\/li>\n<li>Improve: The admin can choose against which well-known currencies the exchange rates are stored (these are the &#8220;VS currencies&#8221; and correspond to CoinGecko data).<\/li>\n<li>Improve: The frontend UIs, when they display equivalent amounts in other currencies, no longer display amounts in one fixed site currency. User can click to rotate between displaying the equivalent amounts in all available &#8220;VS currencies&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Add: Daily withdrawal limits per Currency. Can be set for all users, or per user role.<\/li>\n<li>Add: More information in the plugin&#8217;s widget in the dashboard screen.<\/li>\n<li>Add: A new WP-REST API which utilizes the RESTful API mechanism built into WordPress replaces the old JSON-API.<\/li>\n<li>Change: The old JSON-API is now marked as deprecated and is disabled by default. Can be enabled in settings for backwards compatibility.<\/li>\n<li>Add: A new system that displays documentation in the admin screens. Some screens feature direct links to the relevant documentation. As extensions to the plugin are installed, their documentation books are added to the system.<\/li>\n<li>Change: The user profile screen has been improved. Lists all balances held by a user and links to the user&#8217;s lists of Addresses and Transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Change: The cold storage UI screens have been improved.<\/li>\n<li>Remove: The frontend Widgets have been removed. Please use the shortcodes instead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.18<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: The shortcode <code>[wallets_depositextra template=\"static_textonly\" symbol=\"???\"]<\/code> now displays address extra info correctly if such info is present.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Another issue related to the display of the cold storage screen.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.17<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Issue while sending emails to names that contain a comma symbol (,) is now fixed.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Prevent issue in cold storage screen that caused error in PHP8 and warnings in PHP7 or earlier.<\/li>\n<li>Change: Referral links in cold storage screen are now updated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.16<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve: When crypto ticker symbols clash with fiat ticker symbols, fiat symbols take priority for now. This issue will be ultimately fixed in the next major release.<\/li>\n<li>Improve: Using blockchair as the default block explorer for multiple well-known cryptocurrencies.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Added guard clause to suppress minor warning in admin editor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.15<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve: The exchange rates for coins with a dot in their symbol (e.g. <code>USDT.ECRC20<\/code>) are those of the coin with symbol only the characters before the dot (e.g. <code>USDT<\/code>). This mostly helps the CoinPayments adapter.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Bad logic in <code>wallets_transaction<\/code> action prevented confirmation counts from updating on withdrawal transaction notifications. Is now fixed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.14<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: If, during a withdrawal, a coin adapter fails due to a <code>phpcurl<\/code> timeout, consider the withdrawal done, not failed. Fixes double-spends with Monero or TurtleCoin forks on slow wallets.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: In some situations, email notifications to admins about transaction verifications were not being sent. This is now fixed.<\/li>\n<li>Change: By default, withdrawals are now executed once, for extra safety. This number of retries can be changed in the cron job settings.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: If a coin adapter throws on <code>get_block_height()<\/code>, this no longer crashes the &#8220;Coin Adapters&#8221; admin screen.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.13<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Bug with network_active plugin in the admin screens &#8220;Deposit Addresses&#8221; and &#8220;User Balances&#8221;, is now fixed. Some data from other blogs was previously not shown.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: The Bitcoin RPC coin adapter now recommends that the admin enters into the <code>.conf<\/code> file: <code>rpcbind=IP<\/code> where <code>IP<\/code> is the address of the hot wallet, not the WordPress host.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Typo in documentation.<\/li>\n<li>Add: Link to pre-release notes for the upcoming <em>Bitcoin and Altcoin Wallets 6.0.0<\/em>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.12<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Reverting change from 5.0.11. The original way to store data was to always maintain one set of tables for all the sites in a network. See release notes for details.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.11<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: When activating the plugin on a single site, on a network WordPress installation, the plugin now creates the independent DB tables correctly, for each site on the network.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.10<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add: PHPdoc for the <code>wallets_get_template_part<\/code> as per the WordPress coding style.<\/li>\n<li>Add: New button in <code>[wallets_withdraw]<\/code> and <code>[wallets_move]<\/code> now allows users to easily transact their entire available balance without typing the amount.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Issue with deposit timestamps not being inserted into some DBs is now fixed.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Issue with <code>[wallets_transactions template=\"rows\"]<\/code> introduced in version <code>5.0.6<\/code> is now fixed.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Previously issuing an internal transfer (move) via the PHP API with <code>skip_confirm=true<\/code> would not trigger email notifications, is now fixed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Maximum number of symbol characters changed from 8 to 10. Allows for <code>USDT.ERC20<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Improve: Some DB columns now use the latin1_bin character set to save space and help with DB indexing. Affects new installs.<\/li>\n<li>Add: The debug tab in the admin dashboard now reports the type of Object Cache that is currently active.<\/li>\n<li>Improve: In the coin adapters list, the withdrawal lock icon is now accompanied by text. This solves issues where the combination of font and screen antialiasing makes the state of the padlock difficult to read.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Issue with shortcode <code>[wallets_deposit template=\"list\"]<\/code>, introduced in <code>5.0.6<\/code> is now fixed.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Dynamic shortcodes <code>[wallets_deposit]<\/code> and <code>[wallets_withdraw]<\/code> apply the HTML classes <code>crypto-coin<\/code> and <code>fiat-coin<\/code> according to the selected coin in those UIs, not the page-wide selected coin, which could be a custom coin (Fiat Coin adapter extension).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add: Many elements in the frontend templates now have the HTML classes <code>crypto-coin<\/code> and <code>fiat-coin<\/code> to allow differential styling of fiat and crypto coin information.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: When full node adapter RPC settings are saved, the cached value of the adapter status is evicted, forcing an immediate refresh of the adapter status in the admin screens.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Already minified JQuery UI CSS is no longer re-minified.<\/li>\n<li>Add: Several new shortcode templates and shortcodes allow for displaying &#8220;textonly&#8221; values. e.g. <code>[wallets_api_key template=\"textonly\"]<\/code> displays the user&#8217;s API key in a <code>&lt;span&gt;<\/code> tag that can be inserted in text paragraphs.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Some HTML classes that were previously doubled are now fixed, e.g. <code>deposit-deposit<\/code>, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Change: In confirmation\/notification templates, <code>###USER_LOGIN###<\/code>\/<code>###OTHER_USER_LOGIN###<\/code> is no longer described as &#8220;account nickname&#8221;, since it is the <code>user_login<\/code> and not the <code>nickname<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>Add: In confirmation\/notification templates,<code>###USER_NICKNAME###<\/code>\/<code>###OTHER_USER_NICKNAME###<\/code> is introduced as a variable that is substituted for the user&#8217;s nickname.<\/li>\n<li>Change: Confirmation\/notification templates now use the variable <code>###EXTRA_DESCRIPTION###<\/code> to accurately display the name of the extra description (such as Payment ID, Memo, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Add: New column in coin adapters list indicates max block height up to which the wallet is synced for compatible coin adapters.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Coingecko exchange rates are now loaded with asynchronous buffering, to prevent high memory usage.<\/li>\n<li>Add: New TurtleCoin adapter is showcased in the &#8220;About&#8221; admin screen.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: In <code>[wallets_balance template=\"static\"]<\/code> the symbol next to the equivalent (fiat) amount was incorrect, is now fixed.<\/li>\n<li>Add: Variable substitutions in email templates now allow for new variables: <code>###USER_LOGIN###<\/code>, <code>###OTHER_USER_LOGIN###<\/code>, <code>###USER_NICENAME###<\/code>, <code>###OTHER_USER_NICENAME###<\/code>, <code>###DISPLAY_NAME###<\/code>, <code>###OTHER_DISPLAY_NAME###<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Change: The variable substitution <code>###USER_ACCOUNT###<\/code> is now deprecated. New email templates use the user&#8217;s display name by default (<code>###DISPLAY_NAME###<\/code>).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Exchange rates subsystem no longer attempts to access the old public CoinMarketCap API that has been recently discontinued. An API key is now required, no longer optional.<\/li>\n<li>Improve: The efficiency of CoinMarketCap API queries has been improved, both in terms of performance, and API debits used.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve: More JavaScript assets are not loaded if not needed in current front-end page.
