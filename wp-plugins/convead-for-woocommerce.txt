Otherwise they are &#8220;just looking&#8221;. A good salesperson carefully pushes a customer towards the purchase \u2013 they find out the customer\u2019s needs, get them involved in special offers, and introduce the merchandise from a positive perspective. If a customer isn\u2019t quite ready for the purchase, the salesperson will try to get their contacts to reach out later. After the purchase, the salesperson will stay in touch and inform the client about new goods. Offline stores have learned to teach their salesperson the engagement technique, but online stores usually let the customer go.<\/p>\n<p>Convead is the automatic salesperson for online stores. It will show customers the chosen special offer, ask their email and phone number, and activate an online chat at the right moment. If a client leaves the website, Convead will do its best to bring them back, even if the customer only spent a few moments in the shop and didn\u2019t have a chance to say hello. As for existing clients, Convead will tell them about new merchandise, wish them a happy birthday, or offer them special purchase conditions.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not magic \u2013 Convead needs to be set up.
