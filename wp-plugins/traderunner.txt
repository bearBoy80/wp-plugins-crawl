There is no easier way to create the elusive Multi-Variant Listing and even if you have no need for multiple options on your product, it is absolutely amazing to have your new products on your online store magically appear on Trademe. I sell art prints and before I used this I could only really afford to list one size due to quite a few listings and potentially massive listing fees. After I set this up I have all the sizes that I can offer in one listing and all of a sudden I was selling the larger sizes quite a lot! I can not speak for other platforms but it works great with Woocommerce. Not going to lie it did take a little bit to set up, I found it quite complex at first and I had to contact support a few times. But they were lovely and helpful and it was 100% worth the little bit of time it took to set up. After you get the hang of it and everything is connected you can take care of everything yourself. I couldn't imagine not using it. I also have it for my t shirt store, obviously being able to offer size options is invaluable. Long review for my first ever review but I really am thankful and impressed to be able to use this plugin. Thanks guys!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Automaticly sell stuff on TradeMe<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mikeyb70\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c672069ea3338039799317cb0f68d9ad?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c672069ea3338039799317cb0f68d9ad?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mikeyb70\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">mikeyb70<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 14, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Love it or hate it, TradeMe is New Zealand's leading marketplace for selling pretty much anything. Traderunner enables WooCommerce sellers to automatically put their shop listings onto TradeMe. It works extremely well, and I consider it an absolute must-have for anyone selling in New Zealand. It is well-supported with good technical backup. When I ran into setup issues, I found the support team very helpful. Not just highly recommended, I consider it essential. If Traderunner did not exist, I would not be using Wordpress\/Woocommerce.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/traderunner.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"trademe":"trademe","traderunner":"traderunner","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/traderunner\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2091006","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/traderunner\/assets\/banner-1544x500.jpg?rev=2091006"}}
