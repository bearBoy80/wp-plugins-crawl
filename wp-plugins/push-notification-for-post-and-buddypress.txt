The seamless integration of push notifications has allowed me to easily connect with mobile apps and send notifications to both mobile and web users. The front-end push notification menu is also a great feature, giving my users the flexibility to choose which notifications they receive. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this plugin and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and effective way to send push notifications.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">The perfect BudyBoss App alternative<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/joergwigger\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/944238d4acd02ebb83bb9a7763e3bc64?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/944238d4acd02ebb83bb9a7763e3bc64?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/joergwigger\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">joergwigger<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">March 8, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I implemented the plugin for a large customer a few weeks ago and Murali gave me extremely good support on the way to finish the race.

OK, setting up FCM is a bit tricky but its worth it for the results. Only one suggestion re the customising of the 'Add to Home Screen' pop-up... it needs a bit of work to properly align text and buttons. So using the non-customised option instead which is discrete and works just fine. This is a plugin designed to fully integrate with Buddypress... Nice work!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Amazing plugin by a responsive author.

The REST API provided in the PNFPB plugin has been a game changer!\n\nWe highly recommend this plugin for BuddyPress, and will look forward to seeing how this plugin continues to develop in the
