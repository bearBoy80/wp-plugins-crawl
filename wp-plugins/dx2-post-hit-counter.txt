The plugin uses ajax to count the hit which means it will have no affect on the speed of which the page loads. This also leads to a much more reliable hit count as the hit is not actually counted until the page has loaded. To the end user this hit counter will have almost no affect on the pages load speed.<\/p>\n<p>Your traffic stats are can be viewed quickly from the dashboard widget that will give you a daily overview of the most popular posts along with the total hits on the website for the past few days.<\/p>\n<p>When logged in as an administrator you will be able to see the number of hits that a page has from the WordPress admin title bar. When editing the post you will also be able to see the number of hits the page has received and have the ability to reset the counter if needed. Admin hits will be automatically be discounted to save the hit count being inflated due to testing or other general use of the site by any of the administrators.<\/p>\n<p>A few notes about the sections above:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Light weight method to count page hits.<\/li>\n<li>AJAX powered recording system<\/li>\n<li>Dashboard widget for traffic overview<\/li>\n<li>Administration tools to manage hits<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>https:\/\/dx2systems.com\/<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/dx2posthitcounter<\/code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>The plugin with automatically begin doing the rest.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>How long does it take for stats to update<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Stats are updated in real time.
