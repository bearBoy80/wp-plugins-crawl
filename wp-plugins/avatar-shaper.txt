It allows you to add a unique taste to your blog. Avatar Shaper comes with an easy to use options panel to customize how you want your site&#8217;s avatars to look like. You can customize the shape of the avatars by adjusting the radius of the borders. There are several preset positions to help you choose. If you would like to specify a custom shape you can choose custom and adjust the slider to a border radius that suits you. A preview of your current changes is displayed on an avatar to the right so you won&#8217;t have to keep saving and trying out changes while your site is live. You also have the option to add a shadow to your avatars and change the color of the shadow to whatever you like by the color selector tool.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content\/plugins\/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.<\/p>\n","faq":"<p>\n  The slider is not working\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  A: Make sure &#8220;Custom&#8221; shape is selected\n<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  The Avatar appears to be cut off or isn&#8217;t placed properly\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  A: Enable the custom meathod option and use the avatar_shaper() function instead of the default one.
