This is necessary to allow communication to ERP in the background. Your site is not used and receives notifications of order being synchronized to ERP. There are no personnal data stored on DyaPress Premium Microservice.<\/p>\n<p>A DyaPress Premium UUID is generated by a call to DyaPress Premium Microservice and a callback to your site is saved to allow notifications likes processing order once an order is paid.<\/p>\n<p>In the same way, a DyaPress UUID is generated automatically by DyaPress plugin to allow the REST API to be known by DyaPress Premium Microservice. Only the URL is known, and no DOLAPIKEY is transferred. If you use Dolibarr, you need first to register your installation before being usable by DyaPress Premium. In both case, you need to activate a REST API DOLAPIKEY and copy it to allow connexion to your DyaPress or Dolibarr installation from DyaPress Premium Microservice.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.9.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>added support for deleting DyaPress Premium internal cached data<\/li>\n<li>added filter for inserting Stripe javascript (on by
