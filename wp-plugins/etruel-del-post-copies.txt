But if ignores categories, the query is very much quicker.<\/li>\n<li>You can select if it should be kept as original the first or the last duplicated post, deleting the others. <\/li>\n<li>Allows exclude posts to delete by post IDs.<\/li>\n<li>You can preview a table of posts before make the delete in manual mode.<\/li>\n<li>You can manually delete any single post from the preview table.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Is probable that if there is a large amount of duplicated posts, for the timeouts on each server, the query can be interrupted when is proceeding manually and therefore the log can&#8217;t be recorded. To avoid this decreases the &#8220;Limit per time&#8221; value. A value of 100 or 150 is suitable, but also with 10 at a time, works very well.<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE MAKE BACKUPs OF YOUR DATABASE AND FILES BEFORE USE.  This will avoid you many problems if something goes wrong.<\/p>\n<h4>Add-On<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/etruel.com\/downloads\/wp-edel-oldest-post\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP-Delete Oldest Posts<\/a> Allows to select a date to delete all posts published before that date and\/or you can establish a period with a cron job to continuously deleting the old posts and just remains that period on database.  Example: I want to keep just the last six months of posts in my blog then the oldest are deleted.<\/p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER:<br \/>\nThis plugin deletes posts and\/or images and other things.
