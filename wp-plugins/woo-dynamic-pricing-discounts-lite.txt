I was also impressed with the simplicity of the interface, and the large number of options available for building rules of all kinds.\n\nThe one thing I wanted to test was simply to offer a discount on the price of all items in a category, if a person purchased 5 or more. This one worked, and oh, how sweet it was! We're just building a website for a very small business, but if it grows, I'll definitely purchase the Pro version.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Not what it appears<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"3 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"3\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/corinne46\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/eee26b651f5cfcc3237a40ce32903e64?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/eee26b651f5cfcc3237a40ce32903e64?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/corinne46\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">corinne46<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">April 8, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I had high hopes for this plugin, but alas it did not match the reviews on their site. The features seemed impressive, but they did not work. Support was actually awful! Because of the time difference, I had to wait at least 24 hours for a response. - So back and forth for 24 hours at a time, after 5 days, I still was unable to get this plugin to work. Very disappointed as it appeared to be perfect for my needs.\n\nAt last they got me a version of this plugin that worked. I had moved on to another plugin, but felt obligated to give them another try.\n\nI am planning on upgrading to their PRO version and I will tell you how that works.\n\nI upped the stars to 3, because the time difference issue is still valid. (They do say on their PRO version feature list they have support 24\/7 - so I'll check that out when I upgrade and award more stars if it warrants it.)<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2130607","caption":"Product Discount Rule."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2130607","caption":"Restrictions."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2130607","caption":"Time Validation."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2130607","caption":"Category Discount Rule."},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2130607","caption":"Cart-based Discount Rule."},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=2130607","caption":"BOGO Offer."},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=2130607","caption":"Tier Discount Rule for Product."},"8":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite\/assets\/screenshot-8.png?rev=2130607","caption":"Rules Priority &amp; Permission Settings."},"9":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite\/assets\/screenshot-9.png?rev=2130607","caption":"General Settings."},"10":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite\/assets\/screenshot-10.png?rev=2130607","caption":"BOGO rule Setting."},"11":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite\/assets\/screenshot-11.png?rev=2130607","caption":"Plus Member Rule."},"12":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite\/assets\/screenshot-12.png?rev=2130607","caption":"Discount Rules Table."}},"tags":{"discounts":"discounts","discounts-with-ai":"discounts with AI","dynamic-discounts":"dynamic discounts","ecommerce":"ecommerce","pricing":"pricing"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite.1.0.0.zip","1.2.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite.1.2.2.zip","1.3.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite.1.3.0.zip","1.3.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite.1.3.1.zip","1.3.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite.1.3.2.zip","1.3.3":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite.1.3.3.zip","1.3.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite.1.3.4.zip","1.4.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite.1.4.0.zip","1.5.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite.1.5.0.zip","1.5.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite.1.5.1.zip","1.5.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite.1.5.2.zip"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/redefiningtheweb.com","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-dynamic-pricing-discounts-lite\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=2470705","high":false}}
