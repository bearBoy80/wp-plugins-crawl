I want to list recents update of my posts. Similiar to default \u201cRecent Posts Widget\u201d by WordPress, but this one sort the post by last modified time and enable to add a short note about change or update being made.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I maintaince a wordpress plugin (we name it, \u201cHollydolly Plugin\u201d) and create a post about it on my blog. And because the nature of blog\u2014when new posts are added the older ones are taken down automatically\u2014it\u2019s only a matter of time that post \u2018disappeared\u2019 from frontpage and no longer seen by visitor. So, when I release a new version of \u201cHollydolly Plugin\u201d and updated the old post about it, unfortunately, there is no way I can do to \u2018attract\u2019 visitor to read (again) that post.<\/p>\n<p>Right, in the new version of WordPress (since version 2.7) there is an option to make it as sticky post\u2014make it listed on the top of frontpage. But that not my choice. I want to list it on my sidebar and displayed all over my blog. So I create this plugin for that purpose.<\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>Requirement:<\/h4>\n<p>I create this plugin for WordPress version 2.9.2.
