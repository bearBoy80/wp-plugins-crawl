Instead of opening your mail, copy the email adress of the client and type your mail, it is now way easier! You just open the order of the client and you can type your message in the box this plugin is creating for you.<br \/>\nIt is recommended to use a SMTP plugin that is configuring the <code>wp_mail()<\/code> function, so you are sure the mails are being sent to the client.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20an%20smtp%20plugin%3F'>\nDo I need an SMTP plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No you don&#8217;t need to, but it is highly recommended.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='if%20i%20have%20an%20smtp%20plugin%2C%20does%20it%20needs%20to%20have%20special%20functions%3F'>\nIf I have an SMTP plugin, does it needs to have special functions?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, but it is handy if the plugin is using the <code>wp_mail()<\/code> function of WordPress.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20smtp%20plugin%20do%20you%20recommend%3F'>\nWhat SMTP plugin do you recommend?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We recommend a SMTP plugin that is using the <code>wp_mail()<\/code> function of WordPress.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added donation link<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the functionality to add an email address to CC.<\/li>\n<li>Added the functionality to add an email address to BCC.<\/li>\n<li>Added a signature functionality.
