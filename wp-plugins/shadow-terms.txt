These taxonomies can be used to associate related content from a variety of post types.<\/p>\n<p>When a new post of a supported post type is created, a term mirroring that post is also created. When editing another post type that supports this taxonomy, this term can be assigned to associate the posts.<\/p>\n<p>Shadow Terms does not register support for itself on any post types by default. Custom code must be added to a plugin or theme.<\/p>\n<p>Support can be added to a custom post type with code like:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\/\/ Register the organization post type normally.\nregister_post_type( 'organization', $args );\n\n\/\/ Add support for Shadow Terms to the organization post type.\nadd_post_type_support(\n    'organization',\n    'shadow-terms',\n    array(\n        \/\/ Add post types that support the organization_connect taxonomy.\n        'person',\n        'press-release',\n    )\n);\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>With the example above, whenever an <code>organization<\/code> is created, a term with the same name will be created under the <code>organization_connect<\/code> taxonomy.
