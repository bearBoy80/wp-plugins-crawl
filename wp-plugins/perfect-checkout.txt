Unlike traditional plugins, ours actually creates a new page in WordPress and automatically embeds our hosted checkout experience directly onto it. The plugin then sets this new page as the checkout page in your WooCommerce settings.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20perfect%20checkout%20modify%20my%20current%20checkout%20-%20what%20does%20it%20actually%20do%20to%20my%20store%3F'>\nWill Perfect Checkout modify my current checkout &#8211; what does it actually do to my store?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Perfect Checkout does not modify your existing checkout page or modify any files on your website except to create a brand new standard WordPress page named \u201cPerfect Checkout\u201d which you can see in WordPress &gt; Pages. Disabling the plugin will completely remove Perfect Checkout and revert your checkout back to the exact same setup you had before installing our plugin.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20my%20theme%27s%20header%20and%20footer%3F'>\nCan I use my theme&#8217;s header and footer?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, but hear us out: You can add your own logo, brand colors, and legal links directly in our solution. Multiple studies prove that including navigation and other distracting elements on your checkout page actually hurts your conversion rates &#8211; this is why every Shopify store, sites like Nike.com, and the majority of ecommerce sites exclude headers\/footers. Having a completely clean page to embed our solution onto also guarantees you get pixel perfect UI and rock solid UX on every single store &#8211; regardless of theme or page builder used. Please take our word on this one. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20use%20a%20hosted%20checkout%20for%20woocommerce%20over%20traditional%20plugins%3F'>\nWhy use a hosted checkout for WooCommerce over traditional plugins?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Even with custom development, there are actual limitations in what you can modify in WooCommerce\u2019s PHP templates &#8211; not to mention the endless problems with payment plugin vulnerabilities, bugs, and a host of other issues that simply cost you money and leave your customers questioning your stores integrity.<\/p>\n<p>There is so much WooCommerce is already great at handling &#8211; we just thought the checkout handling could use an upgrade: Use Perfect Checkout to take advantage of all WooCommerce has to offer while upgrading your front end experience, payments, and security to a fully enterprise standard.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20perfect%20checkout%20work%20with%20my%20payment%20processor%3F'>\nWill Perfect Checkout work with my payment processor?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Perfect Checkout currently works with Stripe, Square, PayPal, and PayPal Business.

It seems every hosted checkout solution tries to re-invent things like shipping, coupons, and tax settings that you probably already spent a lot of time setting up. We know that as you grow, your store often requires more advanced plugins to handle things like advanced shipping rates or discounts. Luckily, our API is extremely good at picking up these additional plugin settings and works with the majority of them.
