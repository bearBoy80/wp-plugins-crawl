Here is the <a href=\"https:\/\/platform.openai.com\/docs\/plugins\/bot\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">information about the ChatGPT-User bot<\/a>. It also blocks the the <a href=\"https:\/\/platform.openai.com\/docs\/gptbot\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GPTBot user agent<\/a> that may potentially be used to improve future models.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please be aware of what this plugin does exactly: If you activate the plugin it will add some lines to the robots.txt file to tell Open AI Chat GPT bots (ChatGPT-User + GPTBot) to <strong>not to crawl and index<\/strong> parts of this website.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Please only activate this plugin if you know what you&#8217;re doing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h4>What can I do with this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>This plugin adds the necessary lines to the virtual robots.txt file that WordPress creates automagically to block the OpenAI ChatGPT-User bot that is used by plugins in ChatGPT to crawl websites + the GPTBot user agent that may potentially be used to improve future models.<\/p>\n<h4>What ideas is this plugin based on?<\/h4>\n<p>None. After the launch of the OpenAI ChatGTP plugins that crawl websites, we needed a fast solution to add these lines to the robots.txt file and this was the solution we coded.<\/p>\n<p>In August 2023 OpenAI added information about the GPTBot so we added this user-agent to the plugin.<\/p>\n<h4>What is the robots.txt file?<\/h4>\n<p>The robots.txt file is a plain text file located at the root folder of a domain (or subdomain) which tells web crawlers (like Googlebot) what parts of the website they should access and index.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing a search engine crawler looks at when it is visiting a page is the robots.txt file and it controls how search engine spiders see and interact with the web pages.<\/p>\n<h4>System requirements<\/h4>\n<p>PHP version 7.4 or greater.<br \/>\nWe require 7.4 or higher because we believe that everybody should be running a modern PHP version. When releasing this plugin <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/about\/requirements\/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress recommends PHP 7.4 or higher<\/a>. We would recommend 8.0 or higher as 7.4 has no security updates since 28 Nov 2022.<\/p>\n<h4>How to get this plugin in your Language!<\/h4>\n<p>The first release is avaliable in English and Spanish.
