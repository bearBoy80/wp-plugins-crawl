The Geocoder field is easily be configured to capture geocoder<br \/>\ninput values from other form fields.<\/p>\n<p>It comes with the <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.openstreetmap.org\/wiki\/Nominatim\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OSM Nominatim<\/a><br \/>\ngeocoder enabled by default and supports <a href=\"https:\/\/geocod.io\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Geocod.io<\/a><br \/>\nand the <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/maps\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Maps API<\/a> once you&#8217;ve entered<br \/>\nAPI keys for those services.<\/p>\n<p>The geocoder field can be displayed as a map, as latitude and longitude<br \/>\nfields, as the raw GeoJSON data, or hidden.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin supports WP-GeoMeta, so if you create posts or users with geocoded<br \/>\ndata, their location will be stored as spatial metadata.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOTICE<\/strong>: <em>This plugin uses 3rd party services to provide geocoding results.<br \/>\nThe default geocoder, OSM Nominatim, requests that you include your email address<br \/>\nin API calls if you are making a large number of requests.

The Geocod.io example in particular has extensive comments.<\/p>\n<p>Please see geocoders\/geocodio.php and geocoders\/geocodio.js for details.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Be sure that Gravity Forms 2.0.0 or higher is installed.<\/p>\n<p>With Gravity Forms installed, you can install this plugin in the usual WordPress way.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unzip and upload the plugin files to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/brilliant-geocoder-gravityforms<\/code> directory,<br \/>\nor upload the plugin&#8217;s .zip file through the WordPress plugin screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin on the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Creating your first Geocoding field<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>(Optional) Visit the Gravity Forms settings page enter a Geocod.io or<br \/>\nGoogle Maps API key, or to change which email is sent with OSM Nominatim API calls.<\/li>\n<li>Create a new Gravity Form (or edit an existing one).<\/li>\n<li>(Optional) Visit the form settings page and select which geocoder to use.<br \/>\nIt will use OSM Nominatim by default.<\/li>\n<li>Add the input fields you want the user to fill out.<\/li>\n<li>Add the Geocoder field (under the Advanced Fields tab).<\/li>\n<li>In the Geocoder field associate the geocoder parameters with the other input<br \/>\nfields on your form. <\/li>\n<li>Publish your form and add it to a page like you would any other Gravity<br \/>\nForm!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>and add the Geocoder field from the Advanced Fields<br \/>\nmenu.
