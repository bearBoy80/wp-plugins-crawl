I have reached out to their support and let us see what they say. Also since it is from a new brand it is better to test the plugin with the newer version of wordpress and it says it is not tested.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/imageus.2.4.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"cdn":"cdn","image-compression":"image compression","image-resizer":"image resizer","seo":"seo","webp":"webp"},"versions":{"0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/imageus.0.1.zip","1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/imageus.1.0.zip","2.4":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/imageus.2.4.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/imageus.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/imageus\/assets\/banner-772-250.png?rev=2879172","high":false}}
