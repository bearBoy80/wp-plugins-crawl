It took a long time to set up (I had six special prices, which had to be set up manually on all eight calendars), and it simply didn't work - in fact it blocked customers from buying in that period.\n\nThe (paid for) customer support from VR Cal was very annoying, after going through the process of setting them up as an Admin user, they were worse than useless, and just sent weird messages repeating the error messages (which I had sent them).\n\nWe're still using it, but only because my client agreed to waive the seasonal pricing.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Waste of $, doesnt work &amp; poor support<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/qlick\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e04343593ef66c9b029bc933574e196d?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e04343593ef66c9b029bc933574e196d?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/qlick\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">qlick<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 12, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">we bought 2 pro licenses,  have constant sync issues, takes days to get support,  clients were fed up with their sites not working properly and we went with another product, still fighting to get a refund.

I finally got angry and contacted the customer service (no phone--only email).  I have received 17 emails from their customer service rep over piddly crap \"did you try \"sync\" on the plug-in\".  I have not received any help.  The customer service is awful based on my experience if it even exist.  I worked with an hour with VRPO tech and they said the problem is VR Cal not transferring the data.\nIf anybody has had success getting the \"sync\" function to work properly, please respond.  My expectations are that when I populate my calendar on my website, the calendar on VRBO and Airbnb would automatically populate.  Are my expectations correct?  This seems so simple.  VR CAl says their program follows iCal protocol (same as VRBO and Airbnb) but it doesn't seem to work\nPardon my venting<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Not adequately maintained.

The code is a mess and it's not updated. I mentioned that the Stripe code was way out of date. I wrote to the developer and said I would contribute a patch, but there's no git repo and he never responded.\n\nThen I notice that it throws an error on the Google Maps API (not sure why this needs the Google Maps API at all, but it throw a NoApiKeys warning). Looking at the code, the author hardcoded a maps API key. Since quite a while, you need an active billing account to use an API key. \n\nThen I noticed the other day that my dropdown menus are not working on mobile. I disabled all the plugins for the site and everything worked fine. I activated them one by one and guess which one was killing my dropdowns? \n\nMeanwhile, no developer response to these reviews, no code updates in over a year, seems completely unmaintained. \n\nI still give it two stars because if you have very simple needs, the free plugin has some nice features. But in my case, I need to have more than one calendar, which means the \"Pro\" version (I would call it the \"paid\" version, but not the \"pro\" version). \n\nI forked the code and made numerous fixes on my custom version, but I'm tired of wrestling with this plugin and trying to debug the conflicts it causes elsewhere in the site. So for my part, I am getting rid of it.\n\nIt's a shame really. If taken over by an active developer who would iron out the kinks, I would gladly pay an annual subscription of, say, $30 to have something that actually did what this plugin attempts to do.\n\n===================== Original Review Below ==============\n\nI've tried a bunch of plugins and think this is the best for my needs, but it lacks some polish.\n\nThe good part is that it is easy to use, easy to install, easy to customize. It syncs with AirBnB, VRBO - basically anyone with an iCal feed - both import and export (some plugins are export only, which is useless). Much good to say here.\n\nThe parts that are in the free version are quite good. The best free calendar I've found (though there is a competitor who recently added two-way sync, but that plugin is $39 for the equivalent of what you get here for free).\n\nOn the other hand, there are some not so good things. There are a lot of typos and minor things like this. With the pro version there are things like if you don't have a \"per child\" charge, the logic is there to remove the child field from the entry form, but not the child line item from the price quote.\n\nSo I ended up writing some patches to handle things like that, which worries me, because increasingly I am ending up with a forked version and that can become hard to maintain.\n\nAlso, it is using a very old version of the Stripe javascript. Given that Stripe a credit card processor and this code will be taking payments, it is essential to upgrade to the most recent version of Stripe, which I also did.\n\nI mentioned this to the developer and offered to submit patches, but all I have gotten is silence. Given how rough the code looks, I'm really, really hesitant to turn on the booking part and actually use this plugin to accept payments.\n\nThat's a shame, because really it works better than Woo Commerce for a vacation rental. With a bit more polish, this would be a hands down, no question 5-star plugin. Hopefully we'll see a version 2.1 that will correct some of these concerns.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Free version of the plugin doesn&#039;t work correctly<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pulsewebdesigns\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ec7874bfad26045a218e377da59a953c?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ec7874bfad26045a218e377da59a953c?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pulsewebdesigns\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">pulsewebdesigns<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 29, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Needed a calendar plugin that could accept iCal (.ics) feeds from a third party website and display the calendars on my site.
