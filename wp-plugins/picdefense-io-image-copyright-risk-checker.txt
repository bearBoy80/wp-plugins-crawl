Are you concerned about potential copyright risks associated with your current images? PicDefense.io is your ultimate solution.<\/p>\n<p>Our WordPress plugin doesn&#8217;t just do a reverse image search; it acts as your shield against potential copyright infringement. It scans your website&#8217;s images, assesses their copyright risk and now, with our new feature, allows you to replace any high-risk images with free stock photography from Pexels.<\/p>\n<p>After installing this plugin, it will gather a list of image links from your wordpress site and send them to us (PicDefense.io) via our custom API endpoints. Follow the instructions to create your account and link your WordPress site with your PicDefense.io account. Then, let us do the rest.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20use%20picdefense%3F'>\nWhy should I use PicDefense?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>PicDefense.io is designed to protect your website from potential copyright issues by scanning all of the images on your website and alerting you to any that may be at risk for copyright infringement.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='if%20an%20image%20is%20not%20copyrighted%2C%20am%20i%20free%20to%20use%20it%20in%20any%20way%3F'>\nIf an Image is not Copyrighted, am I free to use it in any way?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not always. Even if a copyright is not immediately apparent, it does not mean the image is free to use without restrictions. There may be other ownership rights that could still put you at risk.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20quickly%20will%20i%20receive%20my%20report%3F'>\nHow quickly will I receive my report?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Usually, the report is generated within a few minutes, depending on the number of images involved in your check.

Each image that PicDefense.io checks goes through a reverse image search. We provide details such as size dimensions, a list of backlinking websites that contain the image, similarity score, as well as our unique PicRisk Score.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='aren%27t%20the%20images%20i%20use%20%22royalty-free%22%20-%20does%20that%20mean%20they%27re%20free%20to%20use%3F'>\nAren&#8217;t the Images I Use &#8220;Royalty-Free&#8221; &#8211; does that mean they&#8217;re free to use?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The term &#8220;royalty-free&#8221; is often misunderstood. It does not mean that an image is free to use without restrictions. Instead, it means that the user does not have to pay a royalty or license fee for each use of the image. However, royalty-free images may still have terms of use, and the user may need to pay a one-time fee to use the image.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20%27replace%20image%27%20feature%20do%3F'>\nWhat does the &#8216;Replace Image&#8217; feature do?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our new feature allows you to replace high-risk images on your WordPress website easily with free stock images from Pexels. After a scan, you will find a &#8216;Replace Image&#8217; button next to each high-risk image. Upon clicking, a window will pop up, presenting related images from Pexels. You can choose the image you&#8217;d like to replace the high-risk one with, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free replacement.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20more%20documentation%3F'>\nWhere can I find more documentation?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>For more detailed instructions and features, please visit our documentation at https:\/\/picdefense.io\/docs\/.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, prevention is better than cure.

As the owner of a WordPress blog and someone who frequently uses third-party content creators, image copyright has always been a major concern. After receiving a copyright demand letter and having to pay a hefty penalty for a single image, I knew I needed to check the rest of my site. I'm just a small blog owner.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">That's when I found PicDefense. Its ability to thoroughly scan my website - which hosts thousands and thousands of images - was a game-changer. The task of manually checking each image would have been impossible for me to do, but PicDefense flagged the images that could potentially cause issues. Does it catch everything? Probably not, but nothing can. I can rest easy knowing at least I did my part in scanning my site.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">The plugin also allows me to whitelist the images I have licenses for, which is a huge timesaver for future scans. I wholeheartedly recommend PicDefense. It's a must-have for any WordPress owner who wants to manage image copyright compliance more efficiently. A solid 10\/10 from me!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Nice idea - Doesn&#039;t flag copyright images<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"2 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"2\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/amplitudecycles\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/5cfc0e9911ef51935665986e6fa509eb?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/5cfc0e9911ef51935665986e6fa509eb?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/amplitudecycles\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">amplitudecycles<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">June 3, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I set up this service, purchased credits, and conducted tests.
