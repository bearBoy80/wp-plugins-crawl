It also works with older versions as well but you should always run the latest WordPress and PHP version for best security and performance. This plugin is used in my critical sites so you can be assured it works perfect.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20slow%20down%20my%20site%3F'>\nWill this plugin slow down my site?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. It&#8217;s coded extremely lightweight, no extra CSS or JS script on frontend. It does only the essential function and nothing more. Very lightweight. No heavy PHP processing or database queries.
