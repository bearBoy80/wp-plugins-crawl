Facial recognition ensures that unauthorized users cannot gain access to your site, even if they have the correct login and password. To use WebID, you must download and install both the WebID mobile app and the WebID WordPress plugin. Once installed, the WebID solution is easier to use than other 2-factor solutions while providing the benefits of full 3-factor authentication.<\/p>\n<h3>WebID User Registration<\/h3>\n<p>To register to use WebID, you will register your mobile number within WordPress during the plugin<br \/>\ninstallation. In addition, you will register your mobile number and enroll your facial profile in the<br \/>\nmobile application that you download to your mobile phone. Detailed instructions are in the<br \/>\nInstallation tab above.<\/p>\n<h3>Privacy Policy<\/h3>\n<p>https:\/\/ivalt.com\/privacypolicy-eula.html<br \/>\nDate of Privacy Policy: March 1, 2023<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>The WebID Mobile App enables WordPress administrators to use the WebID WordPress plugin for full 3-factor authentication. The installation of the application is a simple app download to your mobile phone from either Google Play (WebID-WP) or WebID.com. Once<br \/>\ndownloaded, there are three simple actions to fully activate the application and be ready to use it with the WebID WordPress plugin. To start, open the newly installed application on your mobile phone.<\/p>\n<p>The REGISTER button on the mobile app will instruct you to enter your mobile phone number to enable the link between your computer with the WebID plugin. Once your number is entered, your phone is registered for use.<\/p>\n<p>The ENROLL button will open the WebID facial recognition software to enroll your facial profile. Please follow the real-time instructions that will enable the software to take several \u201cselfie\u201d pictures of you to compare when you do later authentications. When completed, the application will inform you that the enrollment process is complete.<\/p>\n<p>When both REGISTER and ENROLL are completed, the WebID Mobile App is ready to link with the WebID plugin. You will be able to now do full 3-factor authentication by responding with your mobile phone when requested to authenticate your facial profile to complete your<br \/>\nWordPress login. Your enrolled facial profile will be compared with your real-time authentication response to ensure you are actually the user of your phone (and are authorized to login to your WordPress site). You now have much higher security than<br \/>\npreviously available for your WordPress website!<\/p>\n","faq":"<p>Q.
