How do I get rid of them?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Now! Plugin for AdSense draws a red box on your blog posts to show where the ads would be shown if you entered the ad code on its admin page. (These boxes are shown only if you are logged in as admin.) This is meant to serve as a reminder for you to go to the admin page and enter the ad code. If you would like to suppress them, check the option &#8220;Suppress Placement Boxes&#8221; in the Pro section. The right thing to do, however, would be to enter your ad codes in the text boxes for each ad slot, or suppress the ad slot in the Ad Alignment panel.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What are the different versions of the plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Now! Plugin for AdSense is the freely distributed version of a premium plugin. The <a href=\"https:\/\/buy.thulasidas.com\/adsense-now\" title=\"Pro version of the AdSense Now plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro version<\/a> gives you more benefits &#8212; lets you activate a filter to ensure that your ads show only on those pages that seem to comply with Google AdSense policies. It also lets you specify a list of computers where your ads will not be shown, in order to prevent accidental clicks on your own ads &#8212; one of the main reasons AdSense bans you. These features will minimize your chance of getting banned.  It also has full support of mobile devices, and supports per category and per post ad suppression.  The Pro version costs $6.95.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t understand the Pro features. Porn and site block &#8211; can&#8217;t you set those during Asdense ad setup?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>What you have in AdSense is an ability to block ads from certain sites. For instance, if you don&#8217;t like ads <em>from<\/em> my site &#8220;thulasidas.com&#8221;, you can block them. What the pro version gives you is the ability to block ads <em>to<\/em> certain clients. That is, if you don&#8217;t want visitors from certain IP addresses see your ads (because they may click on too many of them, getting your AdSense account banned, for instance), you can with my plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Porn block also is similar &#8212; Google lets you choose non-porn ads (I think). What my plugin does is to look at the content of your page, and block ads if it looks like a porn page. (This can happen if a spammer posts a porn kind of comment on your blog, which again may get your AdSense account banned.)<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How can I contact the plugin author if I need help?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin uses a paid support model in order to manage the support load. Each <a href=\"http:\/\/support.thulasidas.com\" title=\"Ask a support question\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support ticket<\/a> will be charged at $0.95 for the Lite version (and for the Pro version after a short free support period). The support ticket is valid for 72 hours, and further follow-up questions will call for a new support ticket.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How can I control the appearance of the adsense blocks using CSS?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>All <code>&lt;div&gt;<\/code>s that Now! Plugin for AdSense creates have the class attribute <code>adsense<\/code>. Furthermore, they have attributes like <code>adsense-leadin<\/code>, <code>adsense-midtext<\/code> and <code>adsense-leadout<\/code> depending on the type. You can set the style for these classes in your theme <code>style.css<\/code> to control their appearance.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why another AdSense plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The other plugin I have published, <a href=\"http:\/\/buy.thulasidas.com\/easy-adsense\" title=\"The complete solution for all things AdSense related\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Easy AdSense<\/a>, does everything that Now! Plugin for AdSense does and more. But in doing so, Easy AdSense has become an All-in-One AdSense plugin, and not &#8220;Easy&#8221; any more. I wanted to go back to the basics and provide a simple plugin to get our fellow bloggers started on AdSense.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I like its simplicity, but Now! Plugin for AdSense doesn&#8217;t have all the features I need. Can you add *this* and *that* feature?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you think Now! Plugin for AdSense is too lean and mean for your taste, try my full-fledged, feature-rich plugin <a href=\"http:\/\/buy.thulasidas.com\/easy-adsense\" title=\"The complete solution for all things AdSense related\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Easy AdSense<\/a>. I plan to keep Now! Plugin for AdSense simple.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>I just activated the plugin. How come I don&#8217;t see any ads in my blog?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Note that you have to generate your adsense code from Google, and paste the <em>entire<\/em> code in the text box, replacing the existing text. Changing the publisher id alone is not good enough.<\/p>\n<p>If you just created the new Google AdSense code, it may not be active yet. Google takes about ten minutes or so before serving ads. Please try again later.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I control how the adsense blocks are formatted in each page?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Now, in V1.1+, you have more options (using <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Custom_Fields\" title=\"Scroll down to the section titled Usage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Custom Fields<\/a>) to control adsense blocks in individual posts\/pages. Add custom fields with keys like <code>adsense-top<\/code>, <code>adsense-middle<\/code>, <code>adsense-bottom<\/code>, <code>adsense-widget<\/code>, <code>adsense-search<\/code> and with values like <code>left<\/code>, <code>right<\/code>, <code>center<\/code> or <code>no<\/code> to have control how the Google adsense blocks show up in each post or page. A Custom Field <code>adsense<\/code> with  value <code>no<\/code> suppresses all AdSense ad blocks in the post or page.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I use shortcodes?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the Pro version of this plugin, you can control the ad placements using the shortcode <code>[adsense]<\/code> in your blog posts and pages. If you would like to place your ads using shortcodes, please enable it on the Pro page.<\/p>\n<p>By default, only those ads specified by the shortcode will be displayed (when shortcodes are enabled). You can specify how the plugin handles shortcode priority using a drop-down menu. You have these choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do auto placements if shortcode is missing<\/li>\n<li>Do not place any ads if shortcode is missing<\/li>\n<li>Always ignore shortcodes and do only auto placement<\/li>\n<li>Do not place any ads in posts\/pages<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The last option effectively disables the plugin for the body of posts and pages.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I report a bug or ask a question?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please report any problems, and share your thoughts and comments <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/tags\/adsense-now-lite\" title=\"Post comments\/suggestions\/bugs on the WordPress.org forum. [Requires login\/registration]\" rel=\"ugc\">at the plugin forum at WordPress<\/a> Or <a href=\"http:\/\/support.thulasidas.com\/\" title=\"Contact Manoj\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact me<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you have a question or comment about the Pro version, please do not use the forum hosted at WordPress.org, but <a href=\"http:\/\/support.thulasidas.com\/\" title=\"Contact Manoj\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact the plugin author<\/a> using our support portal.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Can I go back to the previous version of the plugin? I don&#8217;t like the modern bootstrap\/AJAX interface.<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can download the <a href=\"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/adsense-now-lite.4.61.zip\" title=\"Last version before the fancy AJAX interface\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">previous version<\/a> and install it. First deactivate and delete the latest version of the plugin, and then follow the <em>Uploading<\/em> method under the <em>Installation<\/em> section of this document. The new version uses an completely different options model, and your old options are left intact in your database, so that you can go back anytime.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why do I get error message saying something about direct access to plugin files?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin admin interface is designed with a loosely coupled architecture, which means it interacts with the WordPress core only for certain essential services (login check, plugin activation status, database access etc). Loosely coupled systems tend to be more robust and flexible than tightly integrated ones because they make fewer assumptions about each other. My plugin admin pages are fairly independent, and do not pollute the global scope or leak the style directives or JavaScript functions. In order to achieve this, they are loaded in iFrames within the WordPress admin interface.<\/p>\n<p>Your web server needs direct access to the plugin files to load anything in an iFrame. Some aggressive security settings block this kind of access, usually through an <code>.htaccess<\/code> file in your <code>wp-content<\/code> or <code>plugins<\/code> folders, which is why this plugin gives a corresponding error message if it detects inability to access the files (checked through a <code>file_get_contents<\/code> call on a plugin file URL). But some systems implement further blocks specifically on <code>file_get_contents<\/code> or on iFrames with specific styles (using <code>mod_securty<\/code> rules, for instance), which is why the plugin provides a means to override this auto-detection and force the admin page.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is the direct access to plugin files a security hole?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Note that it is only your own webserver that needs direct access to the PHP files. The reason for preventing such access is that a hacker might be able to upload a malicious PHP (or other executable script) to your web host, which your webserver will run if asked to. Such a concern is valid only on systems where you explicitly permit unchecked file uploads. For instance, if anyone can upload any file to your media folder, and your media folder is not protected against direct access and script execution, you have given the potential hacker an attack vector. This plugin has no upload facility, so allowing your webserver to serve the plugin admin files in an iFrame is completely safe, in my judgement.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<ul>\n<li>V6.20: Compatibility with WP4.8.
