Meaning, sometimes you'll load a page and say, \"Wait, where's the document that's supposed to be here?\" Then you refresh the page once or twice and the document appears. So for people coming to your site, it leaves a bad impression. Only way around this is to mandatory add the Download File button to each page, so if the file doesn't load on the screen, at least the end-user will see the download button and can access the file that way. However this means you now need to make all your files downloadable to everyone coming to your site. Now, as of August 2020, when I went to add a new document, all of a sudden you can't add a Download button unless you PAY THEM $15. Little parsimonious weasels. I have so many embedded docs on my site that I just paid because it's not worth my TIME to reconfigure everything. Wouldn't have bothered leaving a review, but the sudden desire to charge people for BASIC features (not even anything special) opens you up to getting slammed. Take your 15 dollars. And your one star.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Works good<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/alfredg\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f568a2f598f5f25eac3db7c681ce03f7?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f568a2f598f5f25eac3db7c681ce03f7?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/alfredg\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">AlfredG<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 6, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Te first embedder that works from the start.
