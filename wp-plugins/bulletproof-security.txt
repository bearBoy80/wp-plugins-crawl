In other words, hackers malicious scripts are stopped by BulletProof Security .htaccess files\/Firewalls before those scripts even have a chance to reach the php code in WordPress. BulletProof Security protects your website against 100,000&#8217;s of different hacking attempts\/attacks. The .htaccess security filters in BulletProof Security are designed to match malicious and nuisance attack patterns. The most important benefits of using a finite pattern matching method vs infinite banning\/blocking individual IP&#8217;s, Host&#8217;s, Referer&#8217;s, etc. is that your website performance and Server resources are not negatively impacted. In general, BulletProof Security takes an &#8220;Action Approach&#8221; to website security. Hacker X, Spammer X, Bad Bot X does bad Action Y = Forbidden\/Blocked. An &#8220;Action Approach&#8221; is a much more effective and performance optimized approach to website security since the bad action itself is being blocked\/forbidden instead of attempting to block an individual hacker\/spammer that performed a bad action. Example: BulletProof Security blocks all SQL Injection hacking attempts\/attacks no matter who (IP Address, hostname, Bot name, etc.) performed the SQL Injection hacking attempt\/attack.

File hash comparisons are 100% accurate, which means no false positives will occur for any WP files. All other non-WP files are scanned using standard conventional pattern matching.

The Setup Wizard performs Pre-Installation Checks to check for any pre-existing issues that could cause any issues or problems and displays exactly what needs to be done to fix the issue. The Setup Wizard has a built-in feature called AutoFix that automatically creates known fixes for 100+ Plugins and Themes. The BPS Security Log logs blocked hackers, spammers, bad bots, etc. and also logs anything else that is blocked by BPS. If something legitimate is being blocked in another plugin or theme that needs to be allowed\/whitelisted then the BPS Security Log entry will contain all the information about what exactly is being blocked so that a whitelist rule can then be created in BPS Custom Code. The BPS Security Log also logs all other 403 errors that occur on your website whether or not they are related to or caused by BPS. Turning Off BPS Security Logging will allow your server to handle error logging and display your server error message instead of BPS displaying the standard 403 template file error message. This is also considered a troubleshooting method to determine if an error is actually coming from your server (ModSecurity, etc.) and not the BPS plugin.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20seeing%20security%20log%20entries%20in%20my%20bulletproof%20security%20log.%20what%20do%20they%20mean%3F'>\nI am seeing Security Log entries in my BulletProof Security Log.

Auth Cookie Expiration (ACE) is a WordPress Authentication Cookie that is set when a User logs into your website. Visitors that visit your website that are not logged into your website are not affected in any way by ISL or ACE.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20the%20idle%20session%20logout%20time%20be%20changed%20while%20users%20are%20logged%20in%20or%20after%20a%20user%20has%20already%20logged%20in%3F'>\nCan the Idle Session Logout Time be changed while Users are logged in or after a User has already logged in?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. ISL is Client Browser based and the Idle Session Logout Time is a variable that has a value that can be changed &#8220;on the fly&#8221;. Example: If UserA and UserB login to your site and the Idle Session Logout Time was 60 minutes when they logged in and you change the Idle Session Logout Time to 1 minute while UserA and UserB are logged into your site then UserA and UserB and all other Users that are logged into your site (depending on your ISL option settings) will be automatically logged out after being idle\/inactive for 1 minute.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20the%20auth%20cookie%20expiration%20time%20be%20changed%20while%20users%20are%20logged%20in%20or%20after%20a%20user%20has%20already%20logged%20in%3F'>\nCan the Auth Cookie Expiration Time be changed while Users are logged in or after a User has already logged in?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes and No. Yes, you can change the Auth Cookie Expiration Time option setting for all Users (depending on your ACE option settings), but the WordPress Authentication Cookie Expiration time is set when Users log into your site and cannot be changed &#8220;on the fly&#8221;. So if you change the Auth Cookie Expiration Time while UserA and UserB are already logged into your site then the new Auth Cookie Expiration Time that you choose will not take effect until after UserA and UserB logout and log back into your site. The WordPress Authentication Cookie Expiration time can only be set\/reset at login. This is the default functionality of the WordPress Authentication Cookie.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20bulletproof%20security%20frontend%7Cbackend%20maintenance%20mode%20work%3F'>\nHow does BulletProof Security FrontEnd|BackEnd Maintenance Mode work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>FrontEnd Maintenance Mode creates template files based on the options you choose and save. When you Turn On Maintenance Mode those template files are copied to the root directory of your website. When you Turn Off Maintenance Mode those template files are deleted from the root directory of your website. Maintenance Mode works by allowing the IP addresses that you enter &amp; save to view the site normally. All other IP addresses will see the Maintenance Mode template page. BackEnd Maintenance Mode writes directly to your wp-admin .htaccess file and adds a deny all block of .htaccess code with the IP addresses the you enter &amp; save when you enable BackEnd Maintenance Mode. When you disable\/uncheck BackEnd Maintenance Mode that deny all block of .htaccess code is removed\/deleted from your wp-admin .htaccess file.

BulletProof Security also offers full manual control of editing .htaccess files using the built-in .htaccess File Editor. The BPS Master .htaccess files are pre-made. When you run the Setup Wizard or click the BulletProof Modes Activate buttons your .htaccess Master files are created with specific code for your specific website. You can add additional code to BPS Custom Code or edit the .htaccess files directly or create completely new .htaccess master files from within the WordPress Dashboard using the built-in BPS File Editor or Custom Code &#8211; no FTP required &#8211; no Web Host Control Panel required.
