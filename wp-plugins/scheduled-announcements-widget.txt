Perfect for publicizing an event, alert, or notice that doesn&#8217;t require a full-page write-up. Announcements<br \/>\ncan be scheduled to run indefinitely or during a specific date range, and admins can chose between horizontal or vertical scrolling.<\/p>\n<h3>Additional Details<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin makes use of the JSColor library.

Assign a category to your announcement, and then select that category from the dropdown menu in the widget settings.

Make sure you are using slugs\/IDs for the Announcement Categories<br \/>\n(displayed under the Announcements tab in the Dashboard) and not the default WordPress Categories.<\/p>\n<pre><code>[announcements tax=\"news\"]\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<pre><code>[announcements tax=\"7\"]\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='i%20want%20to%20put%20more%20than%20one%20ticker%20on%20a%20page%2C%20but%20it%20breaks%20when%20i%20try.'>\nI want to put more than one ticker on a page, but it breaks when I try.\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to give each ticker its own unique id.

In the widget, just fill in the<br \/>\ntext box label Ticker ID.<\/p>\n<p>You should also avoid the use of hypens in your ID names, because it will royally mess up the javascript.  In most cases, if you forget, the plugin will automatically replace them<br \/>\nwith underscores.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Overhaul of code to make it compatible with current version of WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Sanitizing inputs on the shortcode option for better security.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue with the shortcode not having default configuration settings if the user hasn&#8217;t visited the config page.<\/li>\n<li>Verified WordPress 4.0 compatibility<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1.8.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added some text to clarify the purpose of some of the widget fields.<\/li>\n<li>Updated the icon<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a badly written query for announcements filtered by category (thanks to Jurrien Dokter for pointing it out and offering a fix!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed some WordPress 3.7.1 compatibility issues<\/li>\n<li>Altered shortcode to accept either category ID or category slug.<\/li>\n<li>Added default CSS id to the shortcode to prevent conflicts with the sidebar widget.<\/li>\n<li>Added code to replace hypens with underscores in user-defined ID names so javascript doesn&#8217;t freak out.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed divider between anouncement title and text, and replaced it with a CSS span styles can be applied to if desired<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with unpublished annoucements showing up in the scroller.<\/li>\n<li>Clarified how the date scheduling feature works.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the ability to change the transition speed of the scroll animation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug that was breaking pages with multiple wigets in use<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a bug with the taxonomy filter within the widget<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Announcements now support shortcode in the body text<\/li>\n<li>Bug Fix: If no announcements are scheduled, the announcment block is hidden<\/li>\n<li>Announcements can now be filtered by category, allowing you to have multiple types of announcements (e.g. News, Alerts, Events, etc.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the ability to specify order of the announcements<\/li>\n<li>Announcement scrolling now pauses on mouseover<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/scheduled-announcements-widget\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2878039\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/scheduled-announcements-widget\/trunk\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2878039\" alt=\"The widget works in both the sidebar and within posts\/pages and themes.\"><\/a><p>The widget works in both the sidebar and within posts\/pages and themes.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/scheduled-announcements-widget\/trunk\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2878039\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/scheduled-announcements-widget\/trunk\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2878039\" alt=\"Customize the widget under Announcements &gt;
