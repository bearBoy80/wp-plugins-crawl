Images are a great way of sparking the interest of the reader to make them read more of your content, as they will see the images and want to know more about them.<\/p>\n<p>But lets face it. There are thousands and of Blogs and they all use Images in their content. If you want to be little different from the traditional Bloggers and using something new try &#8220;Image Shuffle&#8221; plugin. It will make your images live.<\/p>\n<p>You will have provision in admin where you can select Multiple images for the Shuffle. So whenver user moves his\/her pointer\/mouse over the Shuffle (Image) it will randoaly change the image from list you seected in Backend.
