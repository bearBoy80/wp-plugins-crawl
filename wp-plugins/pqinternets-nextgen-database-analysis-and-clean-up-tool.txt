I started looking for what was causing the huge size of some of the tables and I found the issue.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I created this plugin to clean up the orphaned records.\u00a0 It analyzes the WordPress tables for orphaned records related to NextGEN and in the NextGEN specific tables as well.\u00a0 It then shows you the number of orphans in each specific table. The plugin will clean up these orphaned records (delete), if you click &#8220;Clean&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>WARNING &#8211; READ THIS!<br \/>\nI assume NO responsibility for any loss of data from using this plugin.<br \/>\nYOU SHOULD MAKE A FULL BACKUP BEFORE USING THE CLEAN FUNCTION, TO ALLOW RECOVERY IF THERE IS A PROBLEM.<\/p>\n<p>It is beyond the scope of this plugin to cover all the information you may need to backup and successfully restore database tables. However I recommend reading my blog post 27 Essential WordPress Plugins: https:\/\/www.pqinternet.com\/technology\/27-essential-wordpress-plugins, and get whatever backup plugin I currently recommend. At the time of writing this sentence, I recommend BackWPup (link in the blog post along with some notes). You can select to backup just the tables this plugin cleans: wp_ngg_album, wp_ngg_gallery, wp_ngg_pictures, wp_posts, wp_postmeta (note that the wp_ prefix may be different on your system). There is also a link in my post to a utility to help import large sql dumps (backups) if they fail.<\/p>\n<p>Read my blog post: Handling Huge MySQL Database Table Exports\/Imports\/Backups https:\/\/www.pqinternet.com\/web-site-design-html-css\/handling-huge-mysql-database-table-exports-imports-backups<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: The &#8220;Analyze&#8221; and &#8220;Clean&#8221; functions can take A LONG TIME to execute, be patient, do not reload the page!
