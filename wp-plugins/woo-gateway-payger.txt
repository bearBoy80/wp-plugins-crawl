Before using the plugin you will need to register on <a href=\"https:\/\/payger.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Payger<\/a> as Business. This will<br \/>\nallow you to generate a Key and Secret pair that would than be needed to configure the plugin and start showing crypto currencies as a payment option.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How will underpaid orders work?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>In case the payment is marked as underpaid, a new email with a new address is sent to the buyer so that he can complete the payment.<br \/>\nThe order will still be On-hold until the payment isn&#8217;t completed.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Why is my order cancelled after 15 minutes without a payment?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>15 minutes is a Payger limit to finish a payment. Users will get a popup window after &#8220;Place Order&#8221; with a timer counter for 15 minutes.<br \/>\nOn that popup there will be all the information to make the payment. The buyer must copy the address or scan the QrCode to process the payment.<br \/>\nIf the buyer does not finish the payment within 15 minutes the order is cancelled. It&#8217;s exactly the same behaviour as if you define 15 minutes as your hold stock time.<br \/>\nFor that time the order will be &#8220;pending payment&#8221;.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What to do if the order expires?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The buyer will need to select the products again and go to cart and checkout page.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is the stock restored if the order expires?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Order gets cancelled but the stock is not restored. As WooCommerce does not restores stock on cancellation we also don&#8217;t do it.<br \/>\nThere are already some plugins to reduce stock upon cancellation.<\/p>\n<p>The buyer will need to select the products again and go to cart and checkout page.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-gateway-payger\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1957977\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-gateway-payger\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1957977\" alt=\"Payger API Keys Tab\"><\/a><p>Payger API Keys Tab<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-gateway-payger\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1957977\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/woo-gateway-payger\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=1957977\" alt=\"API Key successfully created.
