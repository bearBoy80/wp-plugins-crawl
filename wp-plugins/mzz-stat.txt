Then in the WordPress admin area, in the Dashboard menu under Tools &gt; Mzz-stat, a page shows a report of these statistics, including a count of how many URI (page\/post) views per day. Thus by looking at the statistics page the WordPress administrator can know whether anyone is visiting their site, and, how many uri requests were made on which page on which day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How the Mzz-stat plugin works<\/strong><br \/>\nUpon installing and activating the Mzz-stat plugin, it installs its own table in the WordPress database alongside the other database tables. The plugin logic hooks into the wp_footer action hook, and each time someone requests any page on the site, the plugin inserts a record of that visit into the database table. Then, at any time the WordPress Administrator can go to the Admin page and see the report in the Dashboard menu under Tools &gt; Mzz-stat menu. There will be a list of each page visited (for a time period) along with a count of how many visits for that page per day. If one deactivates the plugin, it will no longer insert records of uri requests unless\/until the plugin is again activated. If one deletes the plugin then that will completely uninstall the plugin and remove the files, database table, and data.<\/p>\n<h4>Credits<\/h4>\n<p>Thanks to CrazyStat ( http:\/\/www.christosoft.de\/CrazyStat ) for inspiring me and thanks to this discussion: ( https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/topic\/stats-plugin-8 ) for helping steer the direction of the plugin.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>To install the plugin manually, unzip the plugin and upload the entire &#8220;mzz-stat&#8221; folder into the &#8220;wp-content\/plugins&#8221; directory of your WordPress website.<br \/>\nThen log into the WordPress dashboard, and under Plugins, click Activate.<br \/>\nThe plugin follows the same install procedure as described at https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins<\/p>\n<p>To completely and permanently uninstall the plugin including its files and data, browse to the WordPress dashboard and under Plugins, under the Mzz-stat plugin, click Deactivate, then click Delete.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>What is the purpose of the plugin, what does the plugin do, and how does the plugin work?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>For for a detailed description of what the plugin does and how it works, please see the Plugin Description tab\/page of this readme.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Does the plugin support multisite?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not currently.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Is the plugin internationalized or localized?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not currently.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How to get support for the plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The primary support is through the plugin&#8217;s WordPress.org support forums page: https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/plugin\/mzz-stat<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How to get\/download the plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The current version of the plugin can be downloaded from its page here on WordPress.org: https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/mzz-stat\/<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Where else to get\/download the plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The current version can also be downloaded from its Github page here: https:\/\/github.com\/mjassen\/mzz-stat\/archive\/master.zip<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>20170304.1423<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>03 March 2017 by mjjojo(mjassen)<\/li>\n<li>In this version 20170304.1423 we remove the old database table upgrade logic. More on this: Just before the last mzz-stat plugin v.20160503.2046, there was a notable database table change. In other words if you want to do an upgrade that jumps from before to after plugin version no. 20160503.2046, then please hit version 20160503.2046 along the way, because it contained logic to perform the upgrade from the old table to the new table.
