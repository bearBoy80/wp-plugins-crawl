Their platform uses proprietary techniques to identify the external digital assets that belong to an organization, and assess them for security issues.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20grades%20will%20this%20show%3F'>\nWhat grades will this show?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently the SecurityScorecard badge of trust will show your grade if it is an A or a B. For lower grades it will not display the grade.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I use the plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easiest way to use the plugin is to simply drag and drop the widget called &#8220;SecurityScorecard Seal of Trust Badge.&#8221; You can also use a shortcode called ssc-badge. <code>[ssc-badge]<\/code>. The shortcode has two options, <code>domain<\/code> and <code>hide_attribution<\/code>. Both are optional. Domain defaults to your website&#8217;s domain and should not be changed in most circumstances. Setting <code>hide_attribution<\/code> to a value of &#8220;1&#8221; will remove the &#8220;Powered by SecurityScorecard&#8221; link under your badge.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Original Version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/securityscorecard-seal-of-trust-badge\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2697719\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/securityscorecard-seal-of-trust-badge\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2697719\" alt=\"The SecurityScorecard Seal of Trust Badge displayed on a website\"><\/a><p>The SecurityScorecard Seal of Trust Badge displayed on a website<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/securityscorecard-seal-of-trust-badge\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2697694\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/securityscorecard-seal-of-trust-badge\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2697694\" alt=\"Examples of the shortcode\"><\/a><p>Examples of the shortcode<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/securityscorecard-seal-of-trust-badge\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2697694\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/securityscorecard-seal-of-trust-badge\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2697694\" alt=\"Example of the widget\"><\/a><p>Example of the widget<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/securityscorecard-seal-of-trust-badge.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/securityscorecard-seal-of-trust-badge\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2697719","caption":"The SecurityScorecard Seal of Trust Badge displayed on a website"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/securityscorecard-seal-of-trust-badge\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2697694","caption":"Examples of the shortcode"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/securityscorecard-seal-of-trust-badge\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2697694","caption":"Example of the widget"}},"tags":{"badge":"badge","badges":"badges","secure":"secure","security":"security"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
