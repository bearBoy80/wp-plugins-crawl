If visitor leaves from that page, no event occurs and they are counted as a bounce.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin fixes it by generating an event when visitors scrolls <strong>and<\/strong> stays on page for 30 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from fixing the code, it is also the simplest way to add Google Analytics code to your WordPress blog\/website.
