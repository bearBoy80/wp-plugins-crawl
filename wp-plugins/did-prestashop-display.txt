Even though the free version is all that I need.\n\nEasy to set up the webservice in prestashop backoffice, and easy to use the shortcodes. Remember to look in the Documentation in your wordpress-menu after you have installed the plugin. to be able to add correct shortcodes for your currency-symbols and texts and such.\n\nVery nice work by the developer, and my guess is that this plugin will get a lot of 5 star reviews once it's picked up by the prestashop community.\n\nThank you developer!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/did-prestashop-display.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/did-prestashop-display\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=2352490","caption":"<strong>Did Prestashop Display.<\/strong>  Show Prestashop products in your WordPress."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/did-prestashop-display\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=2352490","caption":"<strong>Wordpress plugin to connect to Prestashop.<\/strong> Generation of banners and dynamic links with ectados from your Presatshop directly in your Wordpress.
