It also allows to group post attachments into several sets that can be used to generate galleries for subset of all attached images. I wrote this plugin since I wasn&#8217;t satisfied with standard [gallery] shorttag &#8211; I had to do many workarounds and hacks to have it working according my needs. Shutter reloaded is integrated, but plugin can be used without it (with lightbox etc.).<\/p>\n<h3>Known Issues \/ Bugs<\/h3>\n<h3>Uninstall<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Deactivate the plugin<\/li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it! \ud83d\ude42<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Install and activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Set basic parameters in &#8216;Appearance&#8217; -&gt; &#8216;BSGallery&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Upload some images as attachments to your post<\/li>\n<li>Use shorttags [bsgallery] or [bsimage] to insert images into post content<\/li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it! \ud83d\ude42<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugfix &#8211; only files of mimetype &#8220;image\/*&#8221; are shown <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new parameter for bsgallery shortcode &#8211; &#8220;template&#8221;.
