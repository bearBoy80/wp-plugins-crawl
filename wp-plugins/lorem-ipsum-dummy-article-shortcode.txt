This includes paragraphs, commas, headings, hyperlinks and images. The output is easily adjustable through the shortcode attributes.<br \/>\nThe generated code is also <strong>seeded<\/strong>, meaning that the dummy html on page-x will always look the same (unless you specify your own seed).<br \/>\nThe plugin also adds the shortcode filter to the title, so you can also use [lll h] in your post title.<\/p>\n<h4>Shortcode attributes<\/h4>\n<p>You can adjust the shortcode by adding the following attributes. Some attributes have a single character alias for quick use.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>paragraph (alias p): Number of paragraphs. Defaults to 12.<\/li>\n<li>sentence (alias s): Number of sentences per paragraph. Defaults to 5.<\/li>\n<li>word (alias w): Number of words per sentence. Defaults to 12.<\/li>\n<li>header (alias h): Indicates a header. If attribute is set the other attributes will be ignored. Defaults to null.<\/li>\n<li>seed: The random seed used for generating the article. Defaults to the post ID.<\/li>\n<li>deviation: The random deviation used to determine the number of paragraphs, sentences and words. Defaults to 0.5.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Usage<\/h4>\n<p>To use the shortcode simply add <code>[lll]<\/code> to a post or page.<br \/>\nAttributes are used like so; <code>[lll p=8 seed=76432]<\/code>.<br \/>\nWhen used as a post title make sure to add the &#8216;header&#8217; attribute; <code>[lll h]<\/code>.<\/p>\n<h3>Versioning and issues<\/h3>\n<p>The main CVS repo for this plugin is on Github. The version up on WordPress is a distilled build of the major tags.<br \/>\nIf you have any issues or suggestions please put them on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Sjeiti\/Lorem-ipsum-dummy-article-shortcode\/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github<\/a>.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Either use WordPress&#8217; built-in plugin installer.<br \/>\nOr install manually; download and unzip (or clone) the plugin to the \/wp-content\/plugins\/ directory.

Plus, you can tailor it to your specific needs.\n\nI sure am glad this plugin still works under WP 4.6.x and I keep my fingers crossed that it may continue to do so for many iterations of WP yet to come.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lorem-ipsum-dummy-article-shortcode.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"dummy-article":"dummy article","dummy-html":"dummy html","dummy-image":"dummy image","dummy-text":"dummy text","lorem-ipsum":"lorem ipsum"},"versions":{"1.0.5":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/lorem-ipsum-dummy-article-shortcode.1.0.5.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
