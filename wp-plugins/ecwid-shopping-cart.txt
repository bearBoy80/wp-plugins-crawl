We improved automatic cleanup of the plugin cache.

We added Elementor support to Ecwid, so you can add online store functionality to your site pages in Elementor. We added two ecommerce widgets to the Elementor toolbar: the store home page to display the whole storefront and the buy now button to add buy buttons to pages and posts. To try the new widgets, open the Elementor editor in your WordPress admin backend and find the &#8220;Ecwid Store&#8221; section there.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.9.7 &#8211; May 19, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvements for the integration with the Yoast SEO plugin. There was a minor SEO issue with duplicates of the canonical tag on ecommerce store pages. The issue has been fixed and everything should work fine now.<\/li>\n<li>After the last release, the Storefront menu item did not display in the plugin settings in the WP admin.

Ecwid storefronts on Elementor-powered websites loaded slowly on devices with an old iOS version (less than 13.3.1). We fixed it and now stores should work well. <\/li>\n<li>Better warning messages for the site administrator about the hosting connection issues. Some hosting do not allow WordPress plugins connect external services and APIs in their code. That might be because of a hosting server misconfiguration or a tricky firewall setup. Good news is that the Ecwid plugin would work well even in such environment \u2014 you can add a store to your ecommerce site pages and sell. But some of the plugin feature would be disabled. For example, SEO tools wouldn&#8217;t work and the embedded store control panel wouldn&#8217;t show. We added extra warning messages and fallbacks to the plugin code to better handle such situations. If you face such a problem, we recommend contacting your hosting provider to make sure your server can connect the Ecwid API. <\/li>\n<li>Minor improvements for Twenty Twenty and NewShop themes.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.9.5 &#8211; Apr 21, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor changes in the plugin code to comply with the WordPress plugin marketplace recommendations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.9.4 &#8211; Apr 15, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvements for the integration with the All in SEO plugin.

It conflicted with the Ecwid SEO functions: SEO tags and sitemaps generated by Ecwid did not work well with those generated by RankMath. It\u2019s now fixed so if you use the plugin, everything should work fine and Google will index your products pages properly.<\/li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with WPBakery editor and UrbanGo Listing theme.<\/li>\n<li>Improvements for the &#8220;Import from WooCommerce&#8221; tool.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.9.1 &#8211; Feb 21, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a PHP error message (&#8220;Fatal error: Uncaught ArgumentCountError &#8230;&#8221;).

According to the documentation, for this hook you need to pass two parameters.

We&#8217;ve fixed it.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.5.2 &#8211; Apr 3, 2019<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.5.1 &#8211; Mar 28, 2019<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a minor appearance issue in the Ecwid e-commerce blocks in Gutenberg.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.5 &#8211; Mar 28, 2019<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Added 8 new Gutenberg blocks \u2014 10 in total.<\/strong> The Ecwid plugin now provides 10 ecommerce blocks for Gutenberg for adding online store functionality to your site pages. The blocks include: the store home page to display the whole storefront, the store category page to show a particular category, the large product card to show detailed product information, the small product card to display one or several product widgets, the buy now button to add buttons to blog posts, the search and filters page, the search input block, the shopping cart icon block and the cart and checkout block. To try the new blocks, open Gutenberg editor in your WordPress admin backend, click &#8220;Add block&#8221; and find the &#8220;Ecwid&#8221; blocks set there.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Added In-context &#8220;Edit Product&#8221; links.<\/strong> You can now open store product editor quickly when browsing published store pages as an administrator. Just click the &#8220;Edit Product&#8221; link at the top of the page in the WordPress admin header or the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button at the bottom of the post and you will get redirected to the product details in your e-commerce store dashboard.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Added SEO improvement for the H1 tags on the product and category pages<\/strong>. Ecwid puts product and categories ecommerce data in the page content in a SEO-friendly microdata format so that search engines can index your store well. On the other hand, WordPress pages have their own data, specifically &lt;h1&gt; tags, which stay on product pages and visible to Google when it is indexing your site. So, in addition to a product title like &#8220;My cool product&#8221;, Google may see your store page title on the same page like &#8220;Shop&#8221;. We improved it: the product pages will now have more prominent and clear &lt;h1&gt; tags containing product titles. This should improve indexation and the way your products look in the search results in Google.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Added compatibility with the Enfold theme page builder (Avia Layout Builder)<\/strong>. We learned that Ecwid didn&#8217;t work well with the Avia page builder which is a part of the Enfold theme. Enfold users might notice it was difficult to add Ecwid blocks to a page. We fixed that \u2014 now Ecwid should work fine with Enfold theme.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Added Mega Menu plugin compatibility<\/strong>. Added fixes and layout improvements to make the Ecwid e-commerce plugin compatible with the Mega Menu WordPress plugin. If you use the Mega Menu plugin, you might notice layout issues on your store page. We fixed that. If you find any trouble in how Ecwid works with your theme or plugin, please let us know.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes for the &#8220;Import products from WooCommerce to Ecwid&#8221; import tool.<\/li>\n<li>Ecwid is constantly updated with new features and tools which are of course available to WordPress users. One of the recent major updates is Dynamic AMP emails: we\u2019ve collaborated with Google\/Gmail to launch dynamic email for e-commerce merchants. It&#8217;s available for the Ecwid plugin users now and you will be able to use it without dealing with custom code or any external plugin. Check it out in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecwid.com\/blog\/e-commerce-email.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">blog<\/a>. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.4.15 &#8211; Mar 19, 2019<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed generation of sitemap for Yoast SEO plugin<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.4.14 &#8211; Mar 12, 2019<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a PHP error message (&#8220;Cannot use object of type Closure as array&#8221;)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.4.12 &#8211; Mar 11, 2019<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement for the sharing buttons on the product pages. &#8220;Share to Facebook&#8221;, &#8220;Tweet&#8221; and other share buttons now uses the actual product page URLs instead of a &#8220;proxy&#8221; Ecwid URL. This should make shared links look more appealing in social networks and improve the SEO of your ecommerce store.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed an issue in the &#8220;Import products from WooCommerce&#8221; tool. In some cases, import failed and stopped importing products \u2014 we fixed that, now it should work fine and you can import your products from WooCommerce to Ecwid when you need it.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a Javascript warning message in the browser console when the Recently viewed products widget is used.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements for SEO, stability and performance.<\/li>\n<li>Besides the changes in the plugin, Ecwid e-commerce functionality is constantly updated with new features and tools. One of the recent major updates is product filters \u2014 you can now add product filtering panel to your store search page without dealing with custom code or an external plugin. Check it out in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecwid.com\/blog\/all-sorted-introducing-storefront-product-filters.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">blog<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.4.11 &#8211; Feb 26, 2019<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.4.9 &#8211; Feb 7, 2019<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fixes for the Open Graph image tag (og:image tag) .<\/strong> When you share a page from your ecommerce site on Facebook or in a messenger, you should see the product title, description and image in the sharing preview snippet. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Improvements for the product listing auto-scroll function.<\/strong> In some WordPress themes, the site header might overlap product pages when you navigate from page to page in your online store. We improved it to make the product and category pages appear better to your customers. <\/li>\n<li>Various minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.4.8 &#8211; Dec 26, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved settings interface for the &#8220;Product&#8221; block in Gutenberg (the new WordPress page editor)<\/strong>. You can add a single product to any of your pages or posts using the Ecwid ecommerce &#8220;Product&#8221; block and fine-tune its layout in the block settings on the right side in the editor.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Resolved a minor layout issue caused by the Embed Any Document plugin.<\/strong> The Embed Any Document plugin adds a breaking CSS code to the WordPress admin backend which caused some of the Ecwid plugin admin pages display incorreclty. We fixed that, the plugins are now compatible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>SEO enhancement: improved canonical tags for the sites that display different store categories on different site pages.<\/strong> In such case, the canonical tags on products and categories pages will keep the pages structure as is (link to the page that they are opened from). Otherwise, if you have one main store page displaying the whole catalog, the product\/categories canonical tags will link to the main store page to avoid duplicates issues and make your e-commerce store appear better in the Google search results.<\/li>\n<li>Minor improvements for the Ecwid admin backend pages navigation. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.4.7 &#8211; Dec 14, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compatibility fixes for Elementor and Gravity Forms.<\/strong> Thanks to a user report, we found a few glitches in how the Ecwid e-commerce plugin works with Elementor and Gravity Forms.

This update brings a set of loading speed improvements for some part of the stores. We will gradually roll out these enhancements to all users. No actions required from your side \u2014 your store will get all of the improvements in this or upcoming releases. But if you ever noticed your store loading slowly, please contact us so we can help you enable this new feature on your site right now.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed an issue in the plugin settings menu on <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress.com<\/a>.<\/strong> Ecwid e-commerce plugin works on WordPress.com sites as well. In the admin backend of <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress.com<\/a> sites, the plugin menu didn&#8217;t look well \u2014 some of the styles and colors were broken. We fixed it, now the plugin admin backend should work fine on both <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress.org<\/a> and WordPress.com installations.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.4.1 &#8211; Nov 13, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress v 5.0 compatibility. This update brings compatibility with the upcoming WordPress version. In particular, we made sure Ecwid e-commerce stores looks good with the new Twenty Nineteenth theme. Also, we polished the Ecwid online store block in the new WordPress editor (Gutenberg) to make sure you can add a product listing to any site page and customize its appearance including colors, product grid layout, store navigation controls, product page appearance and more. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.4 &#8211; Oct 25, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New storefront appearance settings in Gutenberg.<\/strong> The new WordPress page editor (Gutenberg) now has plenty of e-commerce design settings: product thumbnails format and size, button and text colors, category images behavior, product page layout, store navigation elements and a lot more. We previously added these appearance options to your Ecwid store control panel: https:\/\/www.ecwid.com\/blog\/new-ecwid-design-settings-dozens-of-customization-options-no-coding.html. Now they are a part of real-time page building experience: you tweak the appearance, preview changes and publish them right from the page editor. To see the new appearance options, please make sure you enabled the Gutenberg editor in your WordPress admin backend.<\/li>\n<li><strong>SEO fix: 404 status for removed products and categories.<\/strong> Previously, Ecwid didn&#8217;t mark removed products and categories with correct 404 responses \u2014 it just displayed a customer-friendly message saying the product is not available. Google recommends making removed pages clearly marked with a special 404 response code available for search robots to read. We added it to make sure unavailable products will be quicker removed from the Google search results giving more customer attention to the available products.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.3.2 &#8211; Oct 1, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fixed a problem with the WordPress admin menu items.<\/strong> In some cases, the WordPress admin navigation froze when an Ecwid store admin page was opened. Now everything should work fine. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.3.1 &#8211; Sep 26, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Several fixes and improvements.<\/strong> <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.3 &#8211; Sep 25, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compatibility with the popular WordPress page builders: Elementor, Divi, Beaver builder.<\/strong> The Ecwid e-commerce plugin has always been working great with the default WordPress editor to let you easily add a store or a single product to your site pages. In the recent updates, we also added the same functions to Gutenberg editor. In this update, we went further to make sure the most popular page builders are working fine with Ecwid. We added a lot of improvements and fixes to the plugin to make it work better with the Elementor, Beaver page builder and Divi editor. If you are using one of those page builders and having any problem editing your store page, please let us know so we can further improve it. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Avada, Bridge and Parallax One themes improved compatibility.<\/strong> Even though Ecwid is compatible with every WordPress theme by design, some slight fixes and improvements are sometimes needed to make storefront look better. That\u2019s why we are always monitoring how Ecwid pages look and behave in WordPress ecommerce themes. In this update, we are rolling out a few minor improvements to the Ecwid layout for the Avada, Bridge and Parallax One WordPress themes. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fix of a conflict with Master slider plugin.<\/strong> The Master slider plugin used to conflict with Ecwid plugin in the WordPress admin backend, which may cause some of the slider management pages look broken in the slider dashboard. Fixed. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fix of a conflict with the Ultimate tables plugin.<\/strong> One more plugin conflicting issue is fixed: the Ultimate tables plugin used to affect the Ecwid dashboard layout in the WordPress admin backed. Now it is working fine. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Improvements for the WooCommerce import tool: options, variations and image gallery are now supported.<\/strong> In one of the recent update, we made it possible to import WooCommerce products to your Ecwid e-commerce store using a simple import wizard in the Ecwid plugin. In this version, we\u2019ve made it more powerful so you can now import product gallery images, product options and variations to make the import easier and quicker. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Several fixes and improvements.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.2.4 &#8211; Aug 17, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue with the SEO content of product and categories pages. In the previous update, there was a bug affecting hidden SEO content of the store pages. It\u2019s now fixed \u2014 everything should work fine both for human visitors and search crawlers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.2.3 &#8211; Aug 15, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.2.1 &#8211; Aug 8, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New \u201cMain storefront page\u201d selector in the plugin advanced settings.<\/strong> If you have your storefront added to several pages on your site, you can now choose the main storefront page in the plugin settings (Ecwid \u2192 Advanced). This will define where the store navigation menus and sidebar widgets should be linked to. If you have a single online store page (which is totally OK), this new option won\u2019t be displayed. <\/li>\n<li><strong>New warning messages for the sites with outdated TLS.<\/strong> Ecwid is a PCI DSS level 1 certified ecommerce provider, which is a gold security standard for e-commerce solutions. Put it simply, when you use Ecwid, you have a bank level of online payments security in your online store. One of the requirements to make sure Ecwid merchants can securely process payments on their site is to use up-to-date TLS software on the server where your site is hosted. If your store dashboard doesn\u2019t load in your WordPress admin backend or you see a warning message saying that the Ecwid plugin cannot connect to the Ecwid API, that\u2019s most likely caused by outdated TLS on your hosting. We recommend contacting your hosting in such case. If everything works fine and no warning message appears, that means no action is required from your side.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Minor improvements in the store dashboard in the WordPress admin backend.<\/strong> We improved the scroll behavior on the store admin dashboard pages and fixed a couple minor issues in the Ecwid menu items in the WordPress admin backend.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed an issue with store popup appearing on protected pages before the password is entered.<\/strong> Some online sellers add their store catalog on protected pages on their ecommerce site to restrict access to it for some particular group of customers (e.g. wholesale membership). There was an issue with store catalog appearing in a popup on such pages \u2014 we fixed that. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed an issue in the \u201cAdd store\u201d button in the WordPress page editor.<\/strong> There was a bug that made the store widgets appear at the top of the page when you use the \u201cAdd store\u201d button in the classic WordPress editor. We fixed it, it should work fine now. <\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.2 &#8211; Jun 25, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New! Revamped floating cart icon.<\/strong> We added a new floating cart widget that allows to display a cart icon along with items count and subtotal in the corner of the screen. This way, it&#8217;s always visible and your customers can click it to check their cart contents and proceed with checkout. The new floating shopping cart icon looks better and provides a lot of layout customization options. You can enable it in the Customizer menu under &#8220;Ecwid&#8221; section in your WordPress admin backend: (Appearance \u2192 Customize \u2192 Ecwid).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed a &#8220;Call to undefined function mb_strtolower&#8221; error message that appeared on some hosts.<\/strong> If you saw such an error message, this should be fixed now. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed a minor issue with the way Ecwid clean URLs work with Divi theme.<\/strong> If you&#8217;re using Divi theme on your site, you might notice that product page links gave you a 404 error in some rare cases. It&#8217; fixed now.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.1.1 &#8211; May 30, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compatibility with Gutenberg: buy now buttons in the page editor.<\/strong> Gutenberg editor is getting more and more popular and will soon be the default WordPress editor. To make sure Ecwid users are ready for it, we are adding Gutenberg support to our plugin. In the previous update, we added a \u201cStore\u201d block to the Gutenberg editor toolbar. This update brings another button to the editor toolbar \u2014 \u201cEcwid product\u201d. Use this one to add product widgets and buy now buttons to the pages and posts of your site.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Revamped cart widget for sidebar.<\/strong> We added a new sidebar widget that allows to display a cart icon along with items count and subtotal in the sidebar. The new shopping cart icon widget looks better and provides a lot of layout customization options \u2014 don\u2019t forget to play with its settings when adding it to your sidebar. You can find the new widget under Appearance \u2192 Widgets in your WordPress admin backend. <\/li>\n<li><strong>New design\/appearance settings: new customization options for your storefront.<\/strong> We added a lot of new design settings to your store dashboard. Read this detailed post to learn how to tweak your store appearance: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecwid.com\/blog\/new-ecwid-design-settings-dozens-of-customization-options-no-coding.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/www.ecwid.com\/blog\/new-ecwid-design-settings-dozens-of-customization-options-no-coding.html<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Compatibility with WP Bakery page builder.<\/strong> We fixed a few issues and made Ecwid widgets work fine in the \u201cWP Bakery\u201d page builder. Now you can use that sitebuilder with the Ecwid plugin \u2014 everything should work fine. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed a pre-renderering issue in IE browser.<\/strong> The Ecwid e-commerce plugin adds prerender\/preload tags to your site code \u2014 those are special html codes aimed to make the store page loads faster for your customers. This pre-rendering technology didn\u2019t work well in old IE browsers (IE 11 and older) so we disabled it for IE visitors on your site. It works automatically, so no actions required from your side. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Compatibility with Polylang plugin.<\/strong> We got a report from one of our customers stating that Ecwid didn\u2019t work well with Polylang plugin. We fixed an issue, now everything should work fine. <\/li>\n<li>Improvements and fixes for the plugin navigation in the WP admin menu.<\/li>\n<li>Improvements and fixes for store pages SEO friendly urls. <\/li>\n<li>Fixed a minor issue in the \u201cTools -&gt; Import -&gt; Ecwid products\u201d section in the WP admin backend.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.0.3 &#8211; Apr 19, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed incorrect sorting in the store categories menu widgets. If you use display store categories inn your site menu or in a sidebar using the Ecwid categories sidebar widget, you might notice that the categories list order differs from that in your store control panel. We fixed that \u2014 now the sorting matches. <\/li>\n<li>Fixed unclickable products\/categories in storefront. This issue appeared in very rare occasions, when a site is running on https (like https:\/\/example.com) but someone opens it using an http link (http:\/\/example.com). If there was no redirect (it happens sometimes), you might notice that your store product listing doesn\u2019t react on clicks in the http version of your site. We fixed that \u2014 now it works well in all cases. We recommend redirecting http to https version though anyway.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.0.2 &#8211; Apr 13, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an error that occurred under specific server configurations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.0.1 &#8211; Apr 11, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compatibility with Gutenberg.<\/strong> Gutenberg editor is getting more and more popular and will soon be the default WordPress editor. To make sure Ecwid users are ready for that, we added Gutenberg support to our plugin. Now when you edit a page in Gutenberg, you will see a new &#8220;Ecwid online store&#8221; block in the editor toolbar \u2014 this can be used to add a store to a page. In future updates, we will add ability to add a product widget (or a buy now button) to a post or page in Gutenberg.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New product import tools.<\/strong> Some sellers copy their products to Ecwid e-commerce plugin from WooCommerce, other shopping carts or local database or spreadsheet. We made it easier to do that in Ecwid. You can now see a separate Ecwid block under Tools -&gt; Import in the WordPress admin backend. That block allows you to import products and categories to your store from WooCommerce or external CSV file.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New WordPress admin dashboard widget: help\/educational materials for sellers.<\/strong> We added a new Ecwid block to the WordPress admin dashboard \u2014 it features useful posts from the Ecwid ecommerce blog. The block refreshes itself automatically when we publish a new blog post. Check it to find fresh product updates and tips and recommendations from the Ecwid team on how to better set up your store and sell more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Revamped Ecwid menu in WordPress admin backend.<\/strong> This is step #2 of the menu changes implemented in the version 5.8. Historically, the Ecwid store management dashboard displayed navigation within the central page content when you open it in your WordPress admin backend. So, you open the \u201cEcwid\u201d menu in your WP admin and then navigate through your store admin pages inside that general \u201cEcwid\u201d page. We\u2019re improving this process: now the store admin navigation menu will be a part of the WordPress admin menu. So now you will find management\/settings\/apps and other sections right in the WordPress left-hand navigation sidebar. This will align the Ecwid plugin navigation with the general WordPress navigation and provide more natural way to find the right page of your store dashboard. Also, this will free some space in the page central area to make it more convenient to manage your store, especially on mobile devices.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<li>6.0.1 fixes compatibility issues with outdated php versions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.8.2 &#8211; Mar 9, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fixed an issue with the categories menu appeared in the version 5.8.1.<\/strong> <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.8.1 &#8211; Mar 7, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compatibility with the Yoast premium SEO plugin.<\/strong> Yoast recently updated their SEO plugins. We adjusted Ecwid plugin to work well with them. So, as usually, Ecwid should work well with Yoast products, feel free to use them to get your site and online store optimized for search engines. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed an issue with Ecwid buttons in the Elementor page builder toolbar.<\/strong> Ecwid\u2019s \u201cAdd store\u201d and \u201cAdd product\u201d buttons didn\u2019t work well in the Elementor editor toolbar. We hid the Ecwid buttons from the toolbar as a workaround. To add a store or a single product to a page in the Elementor editor, please use [ec_store] and [ec_product] shortcodes or temporarily switch to the default WP editor. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed compatibility issues with Themify AJAX themes.<\/strong> If you use one of Themify themes with AJAX navigation enabled, you might notice that your store page didn\u2019t load sometimes. We fixed that. Ecwid should work well with any WordPress theme. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed an issue with SEO-friendly description on store product pages.<\/strong> Ecwid ecommerce plugin renders your store pages in a special search engines friendly way so that they can index your products and display them better in search results. In some cases, product description wasn\u2019t displayed in that SEO version of store page. We fixed that, everything should work fine and your products should be displayed well in Google search. <\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.8 &#8211; Feb 8, 2018<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved OG tags support.<\/strong> OpenGraph (or OG) tags are special marks in site pages code, that are used to make better snippets when you share a page on Facebook, Twitter and other sites and social networks. We added OG tags to the products pages \u2014 this will make your product title, description and image appear in a snippet\/post when you share a link to that product. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Revamped Ecwid menu in WordPress admin backend.<\/strong> Historically, the Ecwid store management dashboard displayed navigation within the central page content when you open it in your WordPress admin backend. So, you open the \u201cEcwid\u201d menu in your WP admin and then navigate through your store admin pages within that general \u201cEcwid\u201d page. We\u2019re improving this process: now the store admin navigation menu will be a part of the WordPress native admin menu, so you will find products\/sales\/settings\/promotions\/apps and other sections right in the WordPress left-hand navigation sidebar. This will align the Ecwid plugin navigation with the general WordPress navigation and provide more natural way to find the right page of your store dashboard. Also, this will free some space in the page central area to make it more convenient to manage your store, especially on mobile devices. IMPORTANT: The change is now enabled for the new plugin users only. We will gradually roll it out to all of the plugin users in the upcoming updates. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Improved compatibility with Customizr theme (part 2).<\/strong> We continue improving the Ecwid online store plugin to work well with a popular \u201cCustomizr\u201d theme and to make the store appearance and behavior fit the theme better. This is a continue of the improvements for Customizr that we released in the previous plugin update.

We fixed that. If you find any trouble in how Ecwid works with your theme, please let us know.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed an issue in the way Ecwid shortcode is rendered in the WordPress page editor.<\/strong> You might notice the WordPress editor froze when you changed the &#8220;widgets&#8221; part of the Ecwid shortcode in the editor. For example, if you put a shortcode with categories widget only (without product browser). We fixed it \u2014 now you can adjust the shortcode as you wish. Note this problem only affected the WordPress editor \u2014 neither your store nor your control panel were affected.

After the customer opens your store page, all further browsing will be super fast, including switching between products, opening categories, visiting recently viewed products etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed an issue with title and description meta tags being changed by the Yoast SEO plugin on store pages.<\/strong> If you have Yoast installed, you might notice this issue recently.

Previously, these links might not work  if you added them in the recent weeks. We now fixed it, they should work fine. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed an issue with the browser back button and the customer cart content.<\/strong> In some rare cases (when the Single Sign On tool is enabled), when a logged in store visitor clicked the back button in their browser, the cart content might be refreshed.

If you encounter such behavior on your site, this update should fix that.

Each time your customer opens or refreshes a page on your site, they will see one of your store products in the sidebar. Enable the new random product widget under Appearance\u2192Widgets section in your WordPress admin backend. Do not forget to add pictures to your products to bring site visitors\u2019 attention to your store.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.4.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Speed optimization for the plugin settings pages.<\/strong> We improved the plugin admin settings code to make sure it requires less time and resources and thus works faster. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed a bug in the integration with the Google XML Sitemaps plugin.<\/strong> The sitemaps generated by that plugin might contain invalid data related to the store product pages. That was caused by a bug in the Ecwid plugin. We fixed that, your sitemap should work fine now. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed the \u201cpreg_match\u201d warning messages appearing in rare occasions on the plugin pages.<\/strong> If you happen to see those messages on your site, please update the Ecwid online store plugin, it should fix them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bug fixes and improvements for the SEO content of the product and categories pages on the site.<\/strong> This is for search engines to be able to index your store better. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.4.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Loading speed optimization for the Single Product widgets.<\/strong> We continue working on improving the Ecwid ecommerce plugin loading speed. This update includes optimization of single product widgets. The optimization should have especially good effect if you added multiple single product widgets on a page (e.g. for creating a featured slider or a customized products grid).<\/li>\n<li><strong>The Recently Viewed Products widget is also optimized.<\/strong> It now works much faster. If you haven\u2019t used the widget before, feel free to enable it under Appearance -&gt; Widgets.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The legacy \u201cAppearance\u201d settings page is removed from the plugin admin menu.<\/strong> The old \u201cAppearance\u201d settings page was removed from the plugin settings navigation. To configure the product catalog settings (displayed widgets, products per page etc), you can open your store page for editing in the WordPress admin backend and click the \u201cEdit appearance\u201d button there. If you don\u2019t have a store on the page, click the \u201cAdd store\u201d button in the page editor and set the appearance settings there \u2014 they will be applied to your store on that page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed \u201cStrict standards\u201d code notices.<\/strong> Some users may discover this notice on their site, if the debugging messages are not disabled in the WordPress installation. That didn\u2019t affect the store functionality, but looked odd. We fixed that \u2014 there should not be any warning messages displayed now.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.4.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue with the store page loading in the newest version 5.4. In some rare occasions, the store page might not display right after update to the version 5.4. We fixed the issue to make sure all stores are working well.<\/li>\n<li>Added a workaround for a conflict with the third party \u201cProduct Advisor for Ecwid\u201d plugin. The \u201cProduct Advisor\u201d plugin has a bug that prevents it from working correctly with the newest versions of the Ecwid plugin. When the Product advisor plugin is enabled, the site pages do not respond. We added a workaround to the Ecwid plugin to make sure the WP admin pages will work well for the \u201cProduct advisor\u201d. So, if you\u2019re using the \u201cProduct advisor\u201d plugin and see any issue with your site now, please disable that plugin in your WP admin backend. We\u2019re speaking with the author of the Product advisor plugin so there will hopefully be a solution soon.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improvements in the SEO friendly versions of product pages, which are indexed by search engines.<\/strong> This includes optimized product price format, canonical tags and minor adjustments for SEO titles and descriptions. This is another improvement for search crawlers to better index store pages.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Adjustments for the \u201cAll in one SEO\u201d plugin<\/strong> to make sure it works well with the Ecwid\u2019s new clean URLs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed \u201cpreg match\u201d PHP warning messages<\/strong>, which appeared on some sites with the Ecwid ecommerce plugin enabled.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed an issue with site images in the Newsmag WordPress theme<\/strong> \u2014 some images were not displayed well with Ecwid. We fixed that so everything should work fine in the Newsmag theme now.  <\/li>\n<li><strong>Several fixes and improvements for the floating minicart widget.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Loading speed improvements.<\/strong> We optimized the plugin code to render store pages and widgets faster.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.3.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fix for the \u201cAdd product\u201d button in the WordPress editor.<\/strong> The button was broken in the latest version (5.3) \u2014 it generated invalid shortcode for the single product widgets. The problem didn\u2019t affect existing product widgets, but the new ones didn\u2019t render. It\u2019s now fixed. If you faced a trouble adding product widgets to your pages and posts, please update the plugin and try again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fixes and improvements for the new clean URLs functionality.<\/strong> The new clean URLs for your online store are now more stable and the product pages are more SEO friendly. The changes include: fix in the processing of non-latin characters in the product URLs; adjustment for the sharing metatags on the product pages (rel shortlink meta tags); fix for the store terms&amp;conditions and signin links to make them work properly with the new clean URLs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fix for the Recently Viewed Product widget and the \u201cMinimaze\u201d theme.<\/strong> The widget didn\u2019t work well in this theme. Now you can use Recently Viewed Products with the Minimaze theme as well as with any other WordPress theme.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Layout improvements and fixes for the \u201cRibosome\u201d, \u201cEdge\u201d and \u201cOptimizePress\u201d WordPress themes.<\/strong> If you use one of those themes, you might notice minor layout issues in your e-commerce catalog or in the appearance of minicart widget. The troubles should be fixed now.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed a \u201c404 not found\u201d issue, when Ecwid is used with the \u201cSublanguage\u201d plugin.<\/strong> If you noticed some of your pages respond with 404 errors when Sublanguage and Ecwid plugins are both activated, this update should fix that.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Improvements for the product pages SEO when Yoast plugin is used on the site.<\/strong> If you have the new Ecwid clean URLs enabled in your shop and are using Yoast, this improvement should make meta tags and canonical tags work better on your site with the new URLs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Major improvement in the speed of loading storefront.<\/strong> The plugin now renders ecommerce pages and loads store widgets much more quicker both for your visitors and search engines.<\/li>\n<li><strong>SEO improvements for product and categories pages when SEO friendly URLs are enabled.<\/strong> Now a special plain version of the product page content is generated and loaded in background along with a regular product\/category page. This new version is formatted to provide product and category information in a clear and understandable format for crawl robots that cannot parse JavaScript \u2014 this makes your store indexable by other search engines besides Google (e.g. Yandex). This special version is not visible in a browser, so your customers will as usually get the full store version. Please do not forget to enable new SEO friendly clean URLs to get this working on your site.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fixed the \u201cStrict code standards\u201d notices<\/strong> appearing on some sites with Ecwid plugin enabled. The messages didn\u2019t affect the product catalog and checkout, but looked confusing for the site visitors. We fixed that. The notices should disappear now.<\/li>\n<li>Minor improvement for the SEO friendly clean URLs function.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved SEO friendly clean URLs tool.<\/strong> Previously, if you had your store installed on different pages of your site (e.g. different store categories on different site pages), the SEO URLs worked on the main store\/catalog page only. Now it should work fine on all pages you add your store to. Please make sure you use the \u201cAdd store\u201d editor button when adding your store to the site pages.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The new categories menu widget is now enabled for every site.<\/strong> We released the new categories widget in the version 3.4 \u2014 it is mobile friendly and looks great with any wordpress ecommerce theme. We made it possible to turn on\/off the new widget temporarily to make sure every site would have time to try it before it\u2019s enabled for everyone. Now it\u2019s enabled. If you have enabled it previously, nothing will change for you \u2014 your categories widget is already updated. If you have the old categories widget displayed on your site, this update will replace it with the new one. Please let us know if you have any trouble with the new widget.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixes and improvements for the SEO friendly clean URLs option.<\/strong> We continue polishing the new Ecwid URLs (added in the v.5) to make sure they work well in every store. Have any feedback on your store URLs? Please let us know.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SEO improvement for canonical tags on the product and category pages.<\/strong> The Ecwid ecommerce plugin now hides the store root page canonical and dynamically adds corresponding canonical tags to the product and category pages as you browse the store. This is to improve the pages visibility for search engines, when the new clean URLs option is enabled.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed layout issue in the WordPress 2017 theme.<\/strong> We found an issue with the way Ecwid online stores are displayed in the default WordPress \u201cTwenty Seventeen\u201d theme \u2014 the stores pages appeared too narrow. We fixed that.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fixed a loading speed issue.<\/strong> Some sites with the Ecwid ecommerce plugin might have troubles with loading speed, when store categories menu was enabled. We optimized the way Ecwid renders and displays the store categories navigation so the issue should be fixed now.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed a a bug causing 404 errors on the store page when SEO friendly URLs are enabled.<\/strong> The issue appeared on the sites where store is placed on the site home page. Now the clean SEO URLs option should work fine regardless of whether you add Ecwid store to your site home page or any other page.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor fixes for the new SEO friendly clean URLs feature.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>5.0.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SEO friendly clean URLs.<\/strong> This is major new feature that we recommend everyone to enable. We made store pages URLs clean and SEO friendly. The new URLs do not contain hash sign (&#8220;#&#8221;), which makes your store better indexed by Google. There are less extra characters like &#8216;\/&#8217;, &#8216;~&#8217; or&#8217;!&#8217;, so the page address looks cleaner. As previously, the new product and category pages URLs include product\/category titles to make them easily readable both for Google and for your customers. Of course, no page refresh happens when the customer browses your store: the store pages with new URLs work without page reload, as it&#8217;s been always worked in Ecwid. So, you have your quickly loading store pages with new SEO friendly URLs. To enable the new URLs, navigate to the Ecwid plugin Advanced settings and tick the &#8220;SEO friendly URLs&#8221; checkbox. Note: the old URLs format is supported as well, so all your existing links will continue to work fine.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>An improvement for the floating cart sidebar widget.<\/strong> Now, when you add the widget to any sidebar, the widget will displayed on every site page regardless of whether the sidebar is available on that page or not. This makes it easier for your customer to access their shopping cart and check out.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A few fixes for the integrated search.<\/strong> Recently we added a new feature that integrates your site search with your store products to list them when your customers use the site&#8217;s general post\/page search. We continue improving it and fixing issues you are reporting. Thank you!<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A few improvements and fixes for the &#8220;Add product&#8221; button in the WordPress editor<\/strong> to make it easier for your to add your store products to your site pages.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>4.9.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new search widget is now enabled for every site.<\/strong> We released the new search widget in the version 4.2 \u2014 it is mobile friendly and looks great with any wordpress ecommerce theme.

If you have the old search widget displayed on your site, this update will replace it with the new one. Please let us know if you have any trouble with the new widget.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed a minor issue with displaying store control panel on the Ecwid Dashboard page in WordPress admin backend<\/strong>. The control panel previously might be displayed with a horizontal scrolling. We fixed that \u2014 it should look fine now.<\/li>\n<li>Layout fixes for the ZeroGravity WordPress theme.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>4.9.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fixed an issue with erroneous \u201cRestore backup\u201d messages in the editor in WordPress admin backend.<\/strong> One of the recent changes in our plugin made the WordPress editor display messages like \u201cThe backup of this post in your browser is different from the version below.\u201d In fact, the messages did not mean there was a change that had not been not saved. The restore backup messages are normally hidden by WordPress, but one of our CSS changes (editor page layout tweaks) made them appear. All your data is safe and the warning messages were displayed by mistake. We fixed them now and they should not appear anymore.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>4.9.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improvements and fixes for the new &#8220;Add product&#8221; button in the WordPress editor.<\/strong> We recently added a tool for inserting a product from your store to any page or post on your site.

This will make store more friendly for your new buyers. (edited)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>4.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Integration with WordPress search<\/strong>. This new feature will make your ecommerce site search find store products among other site pages and posts. So, when your customer searches for something on your site, they will see both site content and store products in the search results and will be able to navigate directly to the product pages from there. Please enable it on the Ecwid\/Advanced settings page in your WordPress backend and do not forget to click &#8220;Synchronize products&#8221; link. The feature is now in beta stage and we are actively improving it.

Product widgets that you put on your site are seamlessly integrated with your store and shopping cart \u2014 wherever you place a product or buy now button on your site, the customers will be able to add it to the cart and proceed to checkout as if it was a regular store page. We recommend using product widgets and buy now buttons on every page or post where you mention the products or services you sell \u2013 this way you will provide an easy and natural way for a customer to know more about the product and buy it from the same page, be it a blog post, an &#8220;About&#8221; page, a testimonial or any other page on your ecommerce site.

You may want to use that if you place one product widget per page \u2013 in this case, it will look better when center-aligned. An example shortcode: [ecwid_product id=&#8221;12345&#8221; version=2 center_align=1]. Do not forget to replace 12345 in this example with the actual product ID.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes for the &#8220;Trend&#8221; WordPress theme.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>4.7.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WordPress 4.7 and Twenty Seventeen theme compatibility.<\/strong> The new WordPress version with the 2017 theme is coming soon.

If you want to hide the widget border, for example, the resulting code will like this: [ecwid_product id=&#8221;12345&#8221; version=2 show_border=0]. Do not forget to replace 12345 in this example with the actual product ID.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a bug with the floating shopping cart: the floating cart widget didn&#8217;t appear on some rare WordPress themes, we fixed that.

We improved the look and feel of the single product widgets in Ecwid and added those improvements to the single product shortcode version #2. You can use it like this: [ecwid_product id=&#8221;12345&#8243; version=2]. Do not forget to replace 12345 in this example with the actual product ID. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed error messages appearing on some WordPress sites with the &#8220;Trend&#8221; theme installed.<\/strong> If you use Ecwid shopping cart with Trend theme and recently noticed an error message in your site admin backend, please use this update this update \u2013 it should fix that issue. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>4.7.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a few warning messages appearing on some sites with the new version of the plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>4.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a layout issue in the floating cart widget in the &#8220;Mobius&#8221; WordPress theme.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a few issues with the Single Sign On functionality in the plugin. <\/li>\n<li>Improvements for compatibility with GravityView plugin.

The widgets did not display and generated error\/warning messages on the sites. We fixed that. <\/li>\n<li>Another issue with the latest update is related to the legacy Ecwid shortcodes ([ecwid_script], [ecwid_productbrowser] etc). On the old installations (2 years old and more), the warning messages appeared \u2013 you might notice them on the store page. We now fixed this and everything should be fine, all Ecwid plugin installations work well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>4.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compatibility with the &#8220;Contact form 7 designer&#8221; plugin<\/strong> . When installed, the &#8220;Contact form 7 designer&#8221; plugin  adds its own code to the  and  tags on the page on every page of the site. This conflicted with Ecwid storefront styles. We fixed that \u2013 now if you use the both plugin t the same time, your site pages styles should work fine. Note: this plugin is not the same as the popular &#8220;Contact form 7&#8221;.

If you find a theme that Ecwid has troubles with, please let us know \u2013 we&#8217;ll fix that.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed a bug with the store menu item duplicates.<\/strong> In a recent update, we fixed duplicate Store pages appearing when you deactivate and re-activate the plugin several times. In this release, we fixed a similar bug with the &#8220;Store&#8221; menu items. However often you enable\/disable the plugin, the site navigation menu now works properly, keeping a single Store link, unless you deliberately add a few shop links to the menu (e.g. to have store category links in the menu).<\/li>\n<li>Minor improvement and fixes to make the plugin more stable and user friendly. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>4.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Update in the Single Sign On Module (Ecwid SSO).<\/strong> Single Sign-On allows your customers to have a single login for your WordPress site and your Ecwid store.

Find it under Appearance-&gt;Widgets-&gt;Store Root Categories.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed an issue with the categories list in the page default category option.<\/strong> Ecwid Ecommerce plugin allows you to define a store category shown by default when a customer opens the store page.

In particular, the Ecwid&#8217;s &#8220;Sign in&#8221; link was usually hidden when Single Sign On is used, supposing a customer should use the WordPress login functionality. Now, we made the link visible and redirecting to the WordPress login form to avoid confusing the user who otherwise has to look for the area to login.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Storefront layout improvements for the &#8220;Evolve&#8221; WordPress theme.<\/strong> We adjusted Ecwid plugin to better integrate with a popular and beautiful free WordPress theme \u2013 Evolve.

To make those features more visible and inform you of the new and existing tools you can use in your store, we added a new &#8220;Recommendations for your store&#8221; widget to the dashboard page in your WordPress backend. We will update the content of this ecommerce widget from time to time to provide more actual advice and inform of the new applications and features, so stay tuned.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Storefront layout improvements for the &#8220;Customizr&#8221; WordPress theme.<\/strong> Ecwid plugin is by design compatible with any theme and looks good on any device and screen size your customers use. In this update, we adjusted our plugin to better integrate with one of the most popular free WordPress themes \u2013 Customizr. Ecwid stores now look a way better on WordPress ecommerce sites with Customizr themes to provide better customer experience on any device and to generate more sales in your store. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Added German translations to the plugin settings pages in WordPress admin backend.<\/strong> Thanks to Stefan Wagner for the great job on the plugin translation.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Improved Italian translations for the plugin settings pages.<\/strong> Big thanks to Luciano Delfico who has contributed a lot of Italian translations to Ecwid.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Improvements for Recently Viewed Products.<\/strong> We rolled out a few improvements and bug fixes for the recently viewed products widget.

It&#8217;s fixed. You can use Yoast SEO plugin to make your products listed in your XML site map.<\/li>\n<li>A few improvements in the plugin settings pages layout. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.0.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a few issues in the recently viewed products widget<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Russian translation of the new plugin settings and registration pages<\/li>\n<li>Temporary fix for low quality images in the recently viewed products sidebar widget<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a few layout issues on the new registration page in the plugin backend<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>3.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New sidebar widget: Recently Viewed Products.<\/strong> A new Ecwid&#8217;s sidebar ecommerce widget is now available \u2013 your site can now show the products that the customer has recently visited. The links and images in the sidebar are updated automatically, so the customer can return to the product they previously opened and probably decide to buy it.

When installing the plugin, a user will now see a beautiful welcome page that will introduce them to Ecwid and guide through the setup process. <\/li>\n<li><strong>New easier store connection.<\/strong> Previously, to connect an Ecwid store with a WordPress site and display store products, a new user had to copy and paste their store ID from Ecwid Control Panel. Now, even this easy step became easier \u2013 the user only needs to click a few buttons to authorize themselves and the plugin will automatically detect and connect their store. For those with technical background: we use oAuth2 for this, which is now a part of the newest Ecwid API.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Integration with the XML sitemap functionality of Yoast and All in One SEO Pack plugins.<\/strong> Ecwid has been integrated with Google XML Sitemaps plugin allowing you to generate a sitemap containing the links to your products and categories.

The update prevents incorrect meta tags appearing in some WordPress themes in WordPress 4.1<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.7.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Several bug fixes and minor improvements for the new &#8220;Add Store&#8221; button in WordPress Editor<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.7.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A new sidebar ecommerce widget: Ecwid Store Page Link.<\/strong> The widget adds your store page link to the site&#8217;s sidebar. You may want to use it with blog-focused WordPress themes that don&#8217;t have a navigation menu, e.g. the upcoming &#8220;Twenty Fifteen&#8221; theme. Also, you can consider adding the widget to your sidebar to make your store page more visible to your visitors. <\/li>\n<li><strong>WordPress 4.1 and Twenty Fifteen theme compatibility.<\/strong> The new WordPress version is coming soon and bringing a brand new &#8216;Twenty Fifteen&#8217; theme. Ecwid plugin is now totally ready for the upcoming changes and will work OK in the new environment. Feel free to upgrade your site to WordPress 4.1 as soon as it&#8217;s released.<\/li>\n<li>A few minor improvements and bugfixes for the new &#8220;Add Store&#8221; button released in the version 2.7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.7.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a few issues with the store appearance settings that were discovered in the recently released update (v2.7)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A brand new &#8216;Add store&#8217; tool in WordPress editor toolbar.<\/strong> Ecwid is now integrated with WordPress WYSIWYG editor: click the &#8216;Add Store&#8217; button in the page editor toolbar, chose widgets to show, adjust the appearance and place your store on any page of your site. Now you can decide what store widgets to show and configure store appearance right in the page editor.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New &#8220;[ecwid]&#8221; shortcode.<\/strong> The new ecommerce shortcode allows you to control every aspect of your store appearance by means of tweaking the shortcode parameters right in the store page code. Display\/hide the search widget, choose the minicart layout you like, display different store categories on different site pages and so on. This shortcode serves the &#8220;Add Store&#8221; button mentioned above and almost every tweak is available in the new &#8220;Add Store&#8221; window so you don&#8217;t have to edit any code in most cases. Still, an advanced WordPress user may consider using shortcodes for more flexible and quick integration.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Improved behavior of single product widgets.<\/strong> If you put a single product widget on your site using the [ecwid_product] shortcode, you might notice that it opens a popup with the customer cart when a customer purchases the product. Now single product widgets are smarter: when the customer decides to buy a product and opens a cart page, the main store page on your site will be opened providing the customer with the built-in cart&amp;checkout functionality. The checkout layout will fit better your site design and provide better buying experience when it&#8217;s embedded into a page rather than in a popup-like window.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fix for the Envision theme.<\/strong> The Envision theme didn&#8217;t display Ecwid widgets properly because of a custom page content generation it uses. We issued a workaround from our side to let all Envision users install and use Ecwid plugin on their sites. If you use Envision theme and want to set up an online store on your site, go ahead and install Ecwid ecommerce plugin, it will work OK for you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixes of PHP notices.<\/strong> Some of Ecwid users discovered a few PHP notices (warnings) on their site referring to the Ecwid plugin. Although those didn&#8217;t break anything, they could be quite annoying. We cleaned up the plugin code to get rid of those warning messages, now the plugin should work without any odd message. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.6<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ecwid&#8217;s new SEO URLs compatibility.<\/strong> The new Ecwid clean URLs have been released a few days ago for all Ecwid users. Our WordPress plugin is already fully compatible with the new URLs. Your online store pages will be better indexed by search engines and the search results will look more attractive as the links themselves will mention the product\/category they lead to. Of course, Ecwid will handle all redirects, backward compatibility with the old URL scheme and avoid any duplicate issues. Enjoy the new SE-friendly URLs with no trouble.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Improved formatting of product snippets markup.<\/strong> In this update we tidied up in the product HTML representations generated for search engines and fixes a few issues in the products data markup. In particular, the price and availability tags have been re-formatted according to the Google recommendations to ensure better search engine results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A few improvements and fixes for Twenty Fourteen and Responsive themes layout.<\/strong> Ecwid looks nice on the vast majority of WordPress themes. Additionally, we strive to make it look even better on the most popular themes. This update brings a few more minor layout fixes for the sites with &#8220;Responsive&#8221; and &#8220;Twenty Fourteen&#8221; themes installed. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.5<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Extended compatibility with the &#8220;Responsive&#8221; WordPress theme.<\/strong> Ecwid ecommerce plugin is by design compatible with any theme and automatically adapts itself to any layout and screen size. This makes your store looks good on any device your customers use. One of the most popular free themes for WordPress &#8212; Responsive &#8212; is also famous for its  responsive design. In this update, we adjusted our plugin to better integrate with Responsive theme and Ecwid stores now look a way better on WordPress sites with Responsive themes to provide better user experience on any device and to generate more sales. If you&#8217;re thinking which WP theme to choose for your site, you should definitely try the &#8220;Responsive&#8221; theme with Ecwid. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Added compatibility with WordPress 4.0.<\/strong> WordPress 4.0 is just around the corner and we already prepared our plugin for it. We enhanced the plugin installation process to be compatible with the new plugins management coming with WordPress 4.0 and tested every plugin&#8217;s function to make sure your stores are ready for the upcoming WordPress update. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Automatic store page recovery functionality.<\/strong> Some Ecwid users previously faced issues when they deleted or replaced the plugin&#8217;s generated store page on their WordPress sites. We added a smart mechanism to Ecwid plugin to automatically detect such situations and prevent any possible troubles connected with them. Now, it you decide to move your store from one page to another within your WordPress site or temporary hide your store page, the plugin will detect that, find an alternative store page on your site (if any) and keep the links and all the store functionality working OK regardless of whether you currently have a new store page or not. So, whatever update you&#8217;re making on your site pages, you can rest assured your Ecwid store works fine, be it the product browser, single product snippet or a sidebar widget. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed broken link in single product widgets.<\/strong> We fixed a minor issue with broken links in single product ecommerce widgets, that was reported to us recently.

All existing single product widget will continue working as well &#8212; no actions is required from your side.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fixed a few layout issues on the plugin&#8217;s setting pages.<\/strong> During the recent updates, we were improving the plugin setting pages interfaces. This update brought a few more fixes to the plugin settings pages to make them more user-friendly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Several fixes for old WordPress versions.<\/strong> WordPress is often updated with new features and bug fixes. Still, there are some merchants who use the old versions. While encouraging everyone to update their sites regularly, we want our plugin work great for all users. So, in this update, we added a few fixes addressing issues in the old WordPress versions (2.8 &#8211; 3.1)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.4.3.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Onboarding for the new plugin users.<\/strong> Ecwid ecommerce plugin now displays new helpful messages when you set up your store and configure the setting. The messages guide the new users through the setup process and provide helpful tips and recommendations.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Improvements in the plugin settings pages and messages.<\/strong> We updated the texts and styles of the messages displayed on the settings pages. They became clearer and more user-friendly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Minor optimizations for search engines<\/strong> including tidying up of the product pages &#8216;meta&#8217; descriptions tags and fixing potential issues in compatibility with Yoast SEO plugin.

To embed a product on a page or post, add [ecwid&#095;product id=&#8221;12345&#8243;] shortcode to the page\/post in your WordPress backend. Do not forget to replace 12345 in this example with the actual product ID.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Better SEO for store pages.<\/strong> Ecwid plug-in now automatically adds product attributes to SEO-optimized versions of product pages on your site to let the search engines index attributes like UPC, brand and others along with the other product properties. Also, some improvements were applied to the format of product HTML snippets to meet the Google recommendations on how to better organize ecommerce information (title, descriptions, price etc) on the product details pages. These improvements will help search engines to better index your products and optimize their appearance in search results.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Slight improvements of store layout for mobile devices.<\/strong> All Ecwid stores are mobile-friendly by design, i.e. they adapt themselves to the given layout and look good on mobile devices, so if your ecommerce site is mobile-optimized, your Ecwid store will be as well. Earlier, if you use horizontal categories widget on your WordPress site, you might notice that it didn&#8217;t fit the given width on narrow screens, e.g. when opened on a mobile device. Now, the plugin automatically hides horizontal categories widget on narrow screens to ensure better look on mobile-optimized sites.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Several improvements and bug fixes for plugin settings pages, store appearance and SEO.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.3.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fixed an issue in sitemap functionality<\/strong>.

Canonical links are aimed to specify the preferred (canonical) URL of the web page for search engines to prevent possible duplicate content issues. Ecwid plugin now generates such links automatically for product and categories pages in your store to provide search crawlers with well-structured content and help them better index your store.<\/li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with CloudFlare Rocket Loader. The merchants who use CloudFlare Rocket Loader extensions on their sites might previously experience issues with loading of their Ecwid stores. We&#8217;ve further improved the plugin code to prevent such issues in the future. Now Ecwid plugin should perfectly work with CloudFlare extensions.<\/li>\n<li>Several minor fixes and enhancements<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added compatibility with Google XML Sitemaps plugin.

I do pay a subscription and the support alone is worth the dollars. The site is super clean and easy to set-up.
