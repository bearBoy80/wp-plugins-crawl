It\u2019s incredibly flexible and easy to use, with a drag-and-drop form builder that makes it simple to create exactly the forms I need.<br \/>\n  One of the things I love most about BitForm is the integrations. It can connect to so many different services \u2013 from email marketing tools to CRMs to payment gateways \u2013 that I\u2019ve been able to streamline my workflows and eliminate a lot of manual work. Plus, the integrations are really easy to set up!<br \/>\n  Finally, I have to give the BitForm team a lot of credit for their customer support. They\u2019re always quick to respond and super helpful. That kind of service really makes me feel confident in using their plugin.<br \/>\n  Overall, I highly recommend BitForm to anyone looking for a robust, powerful, and easy-to-use form plugin for WordPress. It\u2019s definitely earned 5 stars in my book!<br \/>\n  @ignitemedical &#8211; WordPress user<\/p>\n<p>The Tiptop of All Form Builders on WordPress.org<br \/>\n  BitForm is the very best, Tiptop Form Builder plugin on WordPress.org: Fluid and highly efficient as it has everything that one needs to create an effective and efficient form(s) of your choice.<br \/>\n  I thank God, I found BitForm from BitApps early: The very first time I used it two years ago I was like, where have you been all this while. Without hesitation, I bought a license and as I never regretted it, this made me go back and pay for the Agency license. I don\u2019t use any other form on my WordPress Project as BitForm is an All-In-One solution for me when it comes to creating and building of Forms. And their support is Topnotch<br \/>\n  Thanks to everyone behind BitForm for such a topnotch Application!<br \/>\n  @uzoamaka &#8211; WordPress user<\/p>\n<p>Great Contact Form<br \/>\n  Great contact form, one of the best I used. Lots of integrations and features, plus great support team.<br \/>\n  @lcicerchia &#8211; WordPress user<\/p>\n<p>Best Form Builder Plugin<br \/>\n  We give to 5 out 5 rating for giving effort for making such wonderful plugin. No need any coding for developing form. There is best features like: Webhooks, Redirect page, Payment gateway, Integration &amp; Much more. Thanks bitpress team<br \/>\n  @statusword &#8211; WordPress user<\/p>\n<p>Flexible, Feature-rich Form Builder!<br \/>\n  I had a chance to play around with multiple Form Builders, and so far Bit Form is my favorite. It is quickly becoming my go-to Form Builder due to the flexibility it has and the speed with which the Bit Form team is addressing issues. I encountered two issues when using the Form Builder, 1 with the icon display on my file attach and second, with the Captcha position. The developer fixed the issue within 24 hours of me reporting it. This is a pretty new Form Builder, but I can tell it may become popular very quickly. I haven\u2019t explored the Zoho integration, which I think is one of its most popular aspects, but can\u2019t wait to do that.<br \/>\n  @dspmax &#8211; WordPress user<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>\ud83c\udf89 Overview of other products we are offering :<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/bit-integrations\/\" rel=\"ugc\"><strong>Bit Integrations:<\/strong><\/a> \u2013 Automate 200+ platforms and Contact form 7, Elementor Form, WooCommerce, Google Sheet, wpforms, Forminator, BuddyBoss, LearnDash, Hubspot, Mail poet, MailChimp, Webhook, ACF, Zapier, Fluent, Forms, CRM, LMS, Membership &amp; many more.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/bit-assist\/\" rel=\"ugc\"><strong>Bit Assist:<\/strong><\/a> \u2013 Connect your all support assistant in a single button.
