Cronjob is not compatible with a Windows based Hosting environment but the WP Cron is.<\/p>\n<p>The Easy Automatic Newsletter Lite plug-in does exactly what it is called. Instead of sweating bullets every time you need to make a newsletter, all you need to focus on with our plug-in is to keep blogging and tweeting great content.<\/p>\n<p>If you can write a blog post every hour, day or week you will have enough content for your newsletter whether you send it out daily, weekly or monthly (you can also send it out  2x per month, quarterly and yearly)<\/p>\n<p>If you write more than that, you&#8217;ll have a robust newsletter begging the question from recipients &#8220;How do you have time to do that?&#8221; ? we think that&#8217;s a good thing.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it, not everyone you already know reads your blog. And in an age where recycling is good, don&#8217;t let great content be used for a single audience.<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to take a month&#8217;s worth of blog posts and format it into a clean e-mail newsletter and send it out to your subscribers? That&#8217;s exactly what our plug-in will do. It will also include your Tweets as well. Once configured (takes about 10 minutes), it works automatically every month. All you need to do is keep blogging and tweeting. Tweeting, by the way, is optional for the plug-in.<\/p>\n<p>If you find it useful please don&#8217;t forget to rate this plugin. In addition, if you really find it beneficial and have some money to spare, your donation is surely appreciated.<\/p>\n<p>** Follow us on Twitter @chiefatlarge for all updates on the Easy Automatic Newsletter Lite plugin (EAN)<\/p>\n<h3>How to use<\/h3>\n<p>NOTE: EAN employs the Core Control plugin by Dion Hulse. It is loaded from our installation package and will appear inside of Tools. Please do not remove or disable the function or else your newsletter will not be able to be scheduled<\/p>\n<h4>Newsletter Post Settings<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on Settings (under the Easy Automatic Newsletter Lite tab in your Dashboard menu)<\/li>\n<li>Configure the Email Frequency, Time to Send (in 24 hour time) and day you prefer to send your newsletter<\/li>\n<li>Choose the category(ies) to send from.<\/li>\n<li>Enter the number of characters (value must be numeric) to include for each blog post within your newsletter.

In other words, it is possible to send the same Tweets in a newsletter as were sent with a prior newsletter. To avoid that, keep Tweeting.<\/p>\n<h4>Placing the Subscribe Widget<\/h4>\n<p>From the list of Available Widgets, locate the widget called Easy Automatic Newsletter. Drag that to one of your sidebars to place the widget.<\/p>\n<h4>Import Subscribers<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Click Import Subscribers to add a comma separated list of email addresses.<\/li>\n<li>If you&#8217;ve added addresses click the check box to affirm that the recipients have authorized their subscription.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Newsletter Status<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>This is chock full of important information.<\/li>\n<li>You can use this section to send test emails to the admin or a defined email address.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>NOTE: If the message &#8220;No post to send&#8221; appears at the top it also means that you cannot send a test email either. If you see that, make a dummy blog post and publish it. You will now see at least 1 post to send.<\/p>\n<h4>MESSAGES:<\/h4>\n<h4>Subscription Messages<\/h4>\n<p>Subscription Messages is where you can customize messages produced when someone subscribes and unsubscribes from your list.<br \/>\nAt the top of this page are short codes you can use in the message body to insert information.<br \/>\nThe default settings can be used as is or you can customize them to be in your &#8216;voice&#8217;.
