Other builders could be added at a later date.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20it%20work%3F'>\nHow does it work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin stores code snippets in the plugin subfolder <code>usr<\/code> and text snippets in the WordPress database as a Heckler post.<\/p>\n<p>During the WordPress <code>init<\/code> phase, the plugin checks for all defined snippets that have defined hooks, and if the <code>rule<\/code> returns true, it hooks the code (loaded from the <code>usr<\/code> folder) or the text to the defined hooks.<\/p>\n<p>In case a snippet is used as a shortcode, before the shortcode is executed the <code>rule<\/code> is checked, and if it passes, only then is the text rendered or the code executed.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20this%20not%20a%20security%20hazard%3F'>\nHow is this not a security hazard?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Good question. This plugin uses <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/WordPress_Nonces\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">nonces<\/a> to protect the edit form, and in order to access the edit form you need to have highest possible privilegies. To make sure that a user has modified a snippet from within the Hecker UI the <code>save_post_heckler<\/code> hook is used. Also, all the stored code snippets are prefixed with <code>&lt;?php if ( !defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) return;<\/code> to ensure a snippet can&#8217;t be accessed directly without loading the WordPress first.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, it&#8217;s as much of a hazard as the plugin editor, or the plugin installer that come by default with the WordPress installation.<\/p>\n<p>If this is still too much of a risk for you, then this plugin might not be for you.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2561461\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2561461\" alt=\"Simple text editor content, with Elementor support.\"><\/a><p>Simple text editor content, with Elementor support.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2561461\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2561461\" alt=\"Hook list used to define hooks on which to display your content, priority, number of arguments (if you are using Code) and if this hook is active or inactive.\"><\/a><p>Hook list used to define hooks on which to display your content, priority, number of arguments (if you are using Code) and if this hook is active or inactive.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2561461\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2561461\" alt=\"Content displayed on the &lt;code&gt;wp_footer&lt;\/code&gt; hook.\"><\/a><p>Content displayed on the <code>wp_footer<\/code> hook.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2561461\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2561461\" alt=\"A Rule editor with VIM support.\"><\/a><p>A Rule editor with VIM support.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2561461\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2561461\" alt=\"A Code editor with VIM support.\"><\/a><p>A Code editor with VIM support.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=2561461\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=2561461\" alt=\"Heckler shortcode embedded into the content.\"><\/a><p>Heckler shortcode embedded into the content.<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=2561461\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=2561461\" alt=\"Output of a Heckler shortcode content generated through a Code script.\"><\/a><p>Output of a Heckler shortcode content generated through a Code script.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/heckler.0.0.2.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2561461","caption":"Simple text editor content, with Elementor support."},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-2.png?rev=2561461","caption":"Hook list used to define hooks on which to display your content, priority, number of arguments (if you are using Code) and if this hook is active or inactive."},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-3.png?rev=2561461","caption":"Content displayed on the <code>wp_footer<\/code> hook."},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-4.png?rev=2561461","caption":"A Rule editor with VIM support."},"5":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-5.png?rev=2561461","caption":"A Code editor with VIM support."},"6":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-6.png?rev=2561461","caption":"Heckler shortcode embedded into the content."},"7":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/heckler\/assets\/screenshot-7.png?rev=2561461","caption":"Output of a Heckler shortcode content generated through a Code script."}},"tags":{"block":"block","code":"code","hook":"Hook","shortcode":"shortcode"},"versions":{"0.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/heckler.0.0.0.zip","0.0.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/heckler.0.0.1.zip","0.0.2":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/heckler.0.0.2.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/heckler.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":[]}
