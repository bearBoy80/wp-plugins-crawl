Just add the string [ifsmailersignupbox] in any post or a div with id &#8220;frontendaddemail&#8221; in any post or theme area: &lt;div id=&#8221;frontendaddemail&#8221;&gt;&lt;\/div&gt; to add the subscription form.<\/p>\n<p>A confirmation e-mail is being sent to the person signing up to verify the e-mail address.<\/p>\n<p>Users can unsubscribe with the the unsubscribe feature.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>The IFS mailinglist plugin doesn&#8217;t require any specific installation. Just unpack the zip file, upload the files to the plugins folder and activate the plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Easiest way to include the signup box is to include it with the string [ifsmailersignupbox] in the content. For advanced use like in your theme just add a div with id &#8220;frontendaddemail&#8221; in your theme.<\/p>\n<p>For sending e-mails just set the configuration options first like your e-mail address that will be used as the &#8216;To&#8217; and &#8216;From&#8217; addresses (E-mails are sent with the BCC option).<\/p>\n<p>Technical: you can create a constant _DO_NOT_USE_WP_MAIL to use the standard php mail function to get bounced messages return. This may not work on all hosting servers.<\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>\nHow do I include the e-mail box for signup in a post\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just add the text [ifsmailersignupbox] anywhere in the text of your post.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nHow many e-mail addresses can I maintain?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The number of people in the e-mail list is unlimited.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nWhat is a batch\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Batches are intended to bypass the limit of the number of mails you can send per hour through your (shared) hosting account.<br \/>\nA batch is nothing more or less than a grouping for the people in your mailing list.<br \/>\nOf course you could use this functionality in different ways, but the origin was just to bypass the server limit of maximum number of e-mails per hour.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>\nCan users easily unsubscribe?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Users can easily unsubscribe by using the unsubscribe feature. In order to use this you need to configure the plugin to send individual e-mails. After that you can use [unsubscribe] or [Unsubscribe] or [unsubscribelink] to add an unsubscribe link in your message.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.8<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Development version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.71<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a nasty bug related to mySQL maximum key size in InnoDB on installation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the location of the batch selection.<\/li>\n<li>Updated working up to WordPress 4.7.3<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.61<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a weird issue with mysql_real_escape_string not working anymore in version 4.5.2 (and maybe one earlier version) in the IFS version storing the daily quotes.
