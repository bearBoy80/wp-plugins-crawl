You can select who sees your posts (only non-registered people, or whatever level of registered user for your site) so you can keep certain things for only people who are members, or you can show ads only to non-registered visitors. You can now also run php code from the news area, so audio or video players can now be run without any other plugin. You can now add the news area to a post or page and also run php code there. You can set start and end dates for all news posts. The Plugin is now fully XHTML compliant.<br \/>\nPart of the www.AWSOM.org series of WordPress Plugins developed by Harknell<\/p>\n<h3>Upgrading From Previous Version<\/h3>\n<p>Upgrade instructions for users of AWSOM News 1.02<\/p>\n<p>To upgrade the AWSOM News Announcement plugin from 1.0.2 to the new version do the following steps in order:<\/p>\n<p>1) Go to your Admin Plugins area and deactivate the previous AWSOM News Announcement plugin.<br \/>\n2) Delete the awsomnews plugin folder from the wp-content\/plugin directory.<br \/>\n3) unzip the new  AWSOM News Announcement zip file and move the contents to your wp-content\/plugins folder<br \/>\n4) Go to your Admin Plugins area and activate the new AWSOM News Announcement plugin.<br \/>\n5) You have 2 options at this point: If you previously used the Theme file tag to display your News Announcement and don&#8217;t want to change<br \/>\nthings then turn the option &#8220;Place the News Announcement On Index Page above Posts&#8221; to off.<br \/>\n6) OR If you want to remove the now unnecessary Theme edits that version 1.0.2 required go into your theme index.php file<br \/>\n(or wherever you may have added the code) and delete:<\/p>\n<p>from your theme file.
