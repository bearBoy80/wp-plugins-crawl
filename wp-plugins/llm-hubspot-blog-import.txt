Please see the FAQ section to learn more on how we handle topics and authors during the import process.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin is designed to be incredibly simple to use and hassle-free. You must have acess to a Hubspot account and the ability to see the Hubspot API key for your account.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This plugin requires PHP 5.6+.<\/strong><\/p>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Installation Instructions<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and activate the plugin through the \\&#8217;Plugins\\&#8217; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Click the \\&#8217;Settings\\&#8217; link on the Plugins page to start the process.<\/li>\n<li>Grab your Hubspot API key by visiting the following link: https:\/\/app.hubspot.com\/keys\/get<br \/>\nNOTE: If you are in control of multiple Hubspot accounts, you will want to make sure you are logged into the correct account before copying your API key.<\/li>\n<li>Paste your API key and click the \\&#8217;Sync Hubspot Data\\&#8217; button to begin.<\/li>\n<li>The process may take up to 3 minutes &#8211; depending on how much data is being processed.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>What happens if the Hubspot Author email doesn\\&#8217;t exist in my WordPress setup?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A new user will be created using the Hubspot Author Email and Full Name (as first name in WordPress). A password is randomly generated and the user will not be informed of the account creation.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do you handle Hubspot Topics?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the Hubspot Topic slug is the same as an existing WordPress Category slug, then the import will tag the existing category. If the Category doesn\\&#8217;t exist, then a new Category will be created and tagged.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>Will there be duplicate content?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The first sync with Hubspot will tag each new post with a Hubspot ID. All new posts will be refreshed during every sync, including Published Status, Published Date, etc. Featured Image will also be refreshed and the old image will be deleted.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<p>1.0.1 &#8211; Fixed some error messages and added an error callback for ajax.<br \/>\n1.0 &#8211; Initial release.<\/p>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/llm-hubspot-blog-import\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1631628\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/llm-hubspot-blog-import\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1631628\" alt=\"Settings Page\"><\/a><p>Settings Page<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Worked like a Magic<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/subhashsrs\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0a468032780340e4590d035152198406?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0a468032780340e4590d035152198406?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/subhashsrs\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">subhashsrs<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 29, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Many many thanks to plugin author!
