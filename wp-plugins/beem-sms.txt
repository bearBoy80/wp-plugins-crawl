The two main features, new order notification and order status change, have been working well and have helped streamline my workflow.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, I would like to suggest the addition of more features to make the plugin even more useful for WooCommerce users. As a growing e-commerce platform, WooCommerce has a variety of needs and it would be great to see Beem SMS expand its capabilities to meet those needs.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example, some features that could be added include SMS notifications for low stock alerts, shipment tracking updates, and abandoned cart reminders. These additions would make Beem SMS a comprehensive and indispensable tool for WooCommerce stores.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overall, I am satisfied with my experience so far and would recommend Beem SMS to other WordPress &amp; WooCommerce users. With a few more features, it could become a must-have for all e-commerce store owners.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beem-sms.2.0.0.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"beemafrica":"beemafrica","beemsms":"beemsms","sms":"sms","woocommerce":"woocommerce"},"versions":{"1.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beem-sms.1.0.0.zip","2.0.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beem-sms.2.0.0.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/beem-sms.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/beem-sms\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=2812808","high":false}}
