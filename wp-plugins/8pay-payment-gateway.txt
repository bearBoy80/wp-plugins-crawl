To do an automatic install of the WooCommerce 8Pay plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click &#8220;Add New&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;8Pay Payment Gateway&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you&#8217;ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it by simply clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;, then &#8220;Activate&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h4>Manual installation<\/h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application.
