This way a Shop Owner can run promotions on days when trade is less busy, or multiple promotions for different days of the week.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin then will perform an additional check when a customer tries a coupon, and returns a helpful message if the coupon is not available for the current day.<\/p>\n<p>More details can be found at <a href=\"http:\/\/twentyzerotwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/woocommerce-plugin-daily-coupons\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TwnetyZeroTwo.co.uk<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Usage<\/h4>\n<p>After installing and activating the plugin, just edit any existing coupon &#8211; The Usage Limits tab will now have new options to choose which days of the week the coupon is valid for.
