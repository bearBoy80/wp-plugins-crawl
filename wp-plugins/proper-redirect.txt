In case of stumbling upon a working alias.<\/p>\n<p>Normally (depending on your settings or control panel) http:\/\/misterwebsite.nl (an alias of www.mrwebsite.nl) just works, but it should be redirected to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mrwebsite.nl\" title=\"MrWebsite\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http:\/\/www.mrwebsite.nl<\/a>.<br \/>\nThe same goes for http:\/\/mrwebsite.nl (it should be with www. instead without), https:\/\/www.mrwebsite.nl (it should be http instead of https) and all other aliases.<\/p>\n<p>Before WordPress 3 this just worked out of the box. But it does not anymore.<\/p>\n","installation":"<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>proper-redirect.php<\/code> to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>So why would I ever want to use this plugin?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well Charlie, that is an excellent question. Thanks very much for asking me this. It gives me the opportunity to elaborate more on the subject. Which I of course like. Because I can sell you more stuff. Oh no, wait, just read on.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It prevents that your website is accessible on multiple domains. It will give your visitors a more consistent experience, the url is in the address bar is always similar. It doesn&#8217;t matter if they use www. or not in the request, it will work (which is good of course) and will redirect to the proper url.<\/li>\n<li>I expect it is better for the search engines as well. It prevents duplicate content. But more important, if someone makes a link to an alias of your domain name it might not be counted as a link to your actual website. Which is negative for your ranking, it will be divided over two urls. Correct me if I am wronk. That is how Brian Cox would say it, right?<\/li>\n<li>For me personally it is handy because I develop on an alias. For example at clientname.mrwebsite.nl. When the website is finished and should go live I want to make the switch to clientname.nl instead of the clientname.mrwebsite.nl. All I have to do now is change the URL in WordPress and the &#8216;subdomain alias&#8217; stops working. Which is nice because WordPress is awesome and the website will be indexed by Google on the temorary address and clients b*tch about that.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<p>First version<\/p>\n","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/proper-redirect.zip","screenshots":[],"tags":{"alias":"alias","aliasses":"aliasses","multiple-domain-names":"multiple domain names","multiple-urls":"multiple urls","redirect":"redirect"},"versions":[],"donate_link":"http:\/\/www.mrwebsite.nl\/donate\/","banners":[]}
