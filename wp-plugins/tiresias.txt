Navigate to the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; section and locate the<br \/>\n&#8220;WooCommerce Tiresias Tagging&#8221; plugin. The activation is done simply by clicking the &#8220;Activate&#8221; link next to the plugin<br \/>\nname in the list.<\/p>\n<p>The activation procedure will create a new page called &#8220;Top Sellers&#8221;. This page can be found and edited under the<br \/>\n&#8220;Pages&#8221; section in the backend. The page contains a single div element that is used to show product recommendations. A<br \/>\nlink to the page should appear in the shops main navigation menu.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin uses the WordPress Action API to add content to the shop. However, there are a few actions that will have to<br \/>\nbe added to the shops theme in order for the plugin to function to its full extent.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>wcnt_before_search_result\n<ul>\n<li>This action should be called above the search result list on the on search pages<\/li>\n<li>You need to add <code>&lt;?php do_action('wcnt_before_search_result'); ?&gt;<\/code> in your themes search page template at the<br \/>\nappropriate location<\/li>\n<li>Please note that this only applies to the WordPress search and not the WooCommerce search\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using the WooCommerce search, you do not need to add any actions to the templates<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>wcnt_after_search_result\n<ul>\n<li>This action should be called below the search result list on the on search pages<\/li>\n<li>You need to add <code>&lt;?php do_action('wcnt_after_search_result'); ?&gt;<\/code> in your themes search page template at the<br \/>\nappropriate location<\/li>\n<li>Please note that this only applies to the WordPress search and not the WooCommerce search\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using the WooCommerce search, you do not need to add any actions to the templates<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>wcnt_before_main_content\n<ul>\n<li>This action should be called at the beginning of every page in the shop<\/li>\n<li>You need to add <code>&lt;?php do_action('wcnt_before_main_content'); ?&gt;<\/code> in your themes header template, inside the main<br \/>\ncontent section<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>wcnt_after_main_content\n<ul>\n<li>This action should be called at the end of every page in the shop<\/li>\n<li>You need to add <code>&lt;?php do_action('wcnt_after_main_content'); ?&gt;<\/code> in your themes footer template, inside the main<br \/>\ncontent section<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you have activated the plugin and added the necessary actions, you need to configure the plugin.
