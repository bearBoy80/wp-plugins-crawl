Business owners often have trouble getting started with blogging. This plugin basically imports writing prompts that are easy to execute, right into the WordPress dashboard. \n\nThere is one for each month and based on a theme. The plugin also provides a checklist for the business owner to follow to make sure the post is publish-ready. \n\nAn added benefit is that this helps a business owner feel inspired to write articles, thereby, kick-starting the content process. For the content marketer, it also gives their client a part to play in the process, giving them ownership.\n\nWell done! I look forward to using this for more customers.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Awesome plugin<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/wlainenaida\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/12f9882875c562aec517e8e9b1475a72?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/12f9882875c562aec517e8e9b1475a72?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/wlainenaida\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">warren laine-naida <small>(wlainenaida)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">January 26, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I manage a dozen websites, and all of them require much more content creation by the owners - especially in the area of blog posts.
