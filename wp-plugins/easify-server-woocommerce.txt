Instant stock adjustments from sales made in your store using Easify epos to your Woocommerce website and visa-versa. \nThe epos system alone also has all the features you could possibly need including stock control, invoicing, purchasing, accounting and so much more and with an Ebay plug-in on the way it just got even better!\n\nA massive thanks to Richard and the team at Easify.
