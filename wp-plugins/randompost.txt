It&#8217;s easy! Just install the randomPost plugin, and select the random URL slug you want to use. This URL slug will redirect your users to a random post of yours! We recommend using the word &#8220;random&#8221; as your URL slug, but the option exists to use any slug you&#8217;d like. Once configured, add the new URL with the slug to your menu as a custom link. That alone will invite visitors to stick around.<\/p>\n<p>To add on top of that, we&#8217;ve added a configurable hotkey! If a visitor presses R on their keyboard, it&#8217;ll automatically load a random post! You can change the hotkey to be any key you&#8217;d like. To add a little more fun to your website, put a notice telling visitors to &#8220;Press R to read a random post&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easily change the URL for the random post redirect. <\/li>\n<li>Easily change the hotkey for the keyboard shortcut to read a random post.<\/li>\n<li>Easily enable or disable the hotkey function.<\/li>\n<li>Uninstalling the plugin will clean up all data it has stored in the WordPress database.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","installation":"<p><strong>Install<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Installing randomPost can be done from inside your WordPress admin panel by going to Plugins &gt; Add New and searching for &#8220;randomPost&#8221;.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can also manually install it by downloading the plugin from wordpress.org\/plugins<\/li>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>randompost<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Customize the plugin from the menu by selecting Settings &gt; randomPost Settings. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Uninstall<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deactivate the plugin from the Plugins menu<\/li>\n<li>Select &#8220;randomPost&#8221; from the list and select &#8220;Delete&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>This will delete all files from the server and all settings from the WordPress database.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>Installation Instructions<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Install<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Installing randomPost can be done from inside your WordPress admin panel by going to Plugins &gt; Add New and searching for &#8220;randomPost&#8221;.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can also manually install it by downloading the plugin from wordpress.org\/plugins<\/li>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>randompost<\/code> folder to the <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Customize the plugin from the menu by selecting Settings &gt; randomPost Settings. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Uninstall<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deactivate the plugin from the Plugins menu<\/li>\n<li>Select &#8220;randomPost&#8221; from the list and select &#8220;Delete&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>This will delete all files from the server and all settings from the WordPress database.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n<h4>How do I change the URL for my random posts?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy.

Your best bet is to use the word &#8220;random&#8221;!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n","changelog":"<h4>1.1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Small administrative update which adds code for future plugin update handling.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated for 4.4 and fixed a small permalinks rewrite bug. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/randompost\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1287500\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/randompost\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1287500\" alt=\"randomPost settings page.\"><\/a><p>randomPost settings page.<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Easy to Install and Increases Traffic<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/melissasaywhat\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6989fe1ff5484dc0884caf8fb925be6e?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6989fe1ff5484dc0884caf8fb925be6e?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/melissasaywhat\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">melissasaywhat<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>A random post plugin is a great way to increase traffic. This plugin is easy to install, easy to set-up and implement. The instructions are very clear. This is a must have for any blogger. I would love it if you could create different rules for specific categories and use the feature more than once, but even without that feature, this plugin is awesome. In the past, I've only been able to implement the random post feature by altering my code on the backend or purchasing a premium theme that includes this function.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/randompost.1.1.1.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/randompost\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=1287500","caption":"randomPost settings page."}},"tags":{"hot":"Hot","key":"key","menu":"menu","post":"post","random":"random"},"versions":{"1.0":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/randompost.1.0.zip","1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/randompost.1.1.zip","1.1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/randompost.1.1.1.zip","trunk":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/randompost.zip"},"donate_link":"http:\/\/obrienlabs.net\/donate\/","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/randompost\/assets\/banner-772x250.png?rev=1287512","high":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/randompost\/assets\/banner-1544x500.png?rev=1287512"}}
