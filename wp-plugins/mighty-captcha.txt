With this plugin, sites owners can avoid spam comment, user registration, and biting password.<\/p>\n<p>Mighty CAPTCHA uses a Google reCAPTCHA technology. To work, API key pair, issued Google, is necessary.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about key pair, please refer https:\/\/www.google.com\/recaptcha\/intro\/index.html .<\/p>\n<p>You can choose which form will be with reCAPTCHA widget or not. For login form and user registration form, a normal size widget is too wide. So you can choose compact widget. (but I do not like it.)<\/p>\n<p>Below is characteristic of new Google reCAPTCHA.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy for ordinary users. They only must check the &#8220;I&#8217;m not a robot&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>When Google reCAPTCHA recognized an access was smell fishy, image authentication screen would appear.<\/li>\n<li>New image authentication screen is without deformed letters, with photo images instead of them.<\/li>\n<li>Photo images authentication is for example &#8220;choose all photos of a cat&#8221;. Easy to human and hard to robot.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s easy to use with smart phone or tablet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Why don&#8217;t you usher it into your site!<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>To install this plugin, you just must do ordinary install procedure like other WordPress plugins.<br \/>\nBut to get it working, you have to get an API key pair from Google, at first I explain this procedure.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Please access https:\/\/www.google.com\/recaptcha\/intro\/index.html .<\/li>\n<li>Press &#8220;GET reCAPTCHA&#8221; button.<\/li>\n<li>Please login to Google account. If you have no account, you must sign up to Google.<\/li>\n<li>If first page appears, press &#8220;Get reCAPTCHA&#8221; again.<\/li>\n<li>reCAPTCHA API key manager will appear, so look up &#8220;Register a new site&#8221; box.<\/li>\n<li>Fill the form.

But you don&#8217;t need how to. Instead of you do, my plugin will usher reCAPTCHA into your site.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>After you got a key pair, you can install the plugin with procedure below.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download Mighty-CAPTCHA.zip to extract into plugins\/mighty-captcha folder, or install the plugin from official library.<\/li>\n<li>At plugins list in the dashboard, activate this plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Mighty-CAPTCHA sub menu will appear, so open it and fill the form.<\/li>\n<li>Key pair is required.
