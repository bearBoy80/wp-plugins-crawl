The advantage of this free service over regular RSS is that it makes your RSS feed available to non-savvy visitors who do not use an RSS reader. Your users don&#8217;t actually have to even know what RSS is.<br \/>\nWith this plugin, you just enter your feed ID, and the embed code is planted on your pages automatically.<br \/>\nAlternatively you can use the included shortcode tags bto include it on a specific page.<\/p>\n<h3>Changelog ===2.0 =* Replaced embed code with version 4<\/h3>\n<h3>Changelog ===1.9 =* Replaced embed code with version 2<\/h3>\n<p>1.8 =* Instead of linking to the form in a seperate window, The plugin now uses a direct iframe to a customized form on grabthatfeed.com, so for the WP site admin, the process is seamless.<\/p>\n<p>1.7 =*first release after testing<\/p>\n<h3>Arbitrary section<\/h3>\n<p>The plugin itself is a simple way to include the GrabThatFeed embed code in your WordPress blog.<br \/>\nIt allows the user to embed the code in the wordpress template, so it appears on all pages.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Add the plugin to your website from the admin plugin search.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the settings page and fill out the form.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","faq":"\n<h4>What does it do again?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin embeds a button\/popup on your site or on specific pages, prompting visitors to subscribe to notifications of new posts on your feed.<br \/>\nOnce a visitor subscribes, he\/she will receive a notification (like a push notification) when you publish a new post.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4>So how is this better than my RSS feed?<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is not better, it is an extension to your RSS feed.
