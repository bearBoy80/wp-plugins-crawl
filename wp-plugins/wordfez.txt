It is seamlessly integrated into WordPress using a TinyMCE plugin.<\/p>\n<p>It will add 2 extra buttons in the WYSIWYG interface for French and English language. Each button inserts 2 anchors to surround each language. The anchors are labeled by small flags.<br \/>\nThe usage is very straight-forward.
