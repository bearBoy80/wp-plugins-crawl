User fields (poll categories) can be defined and maintained in the users&#8217; profiles to provide enhanced result statistics (e.g. showing a choir&#8217;s voices representation on proposed concert or rehearsal dates being polled in order to judge the ability to sing) &#8211; this was the author&#8217;s initial motivation.<br \/>\nFields can as well be automatized in input based on regular expressions applied on the main user&#8217;s field (poll category).<br \/>\nEmail reminders to users that didn&#8217;t vote, yet. Flexible sorting options and much more. Of course: the main shortcode is made for registered users only. Give it a try!<\/p>\n<p>Inspired by and enhancing: Tkama&#8217;s Democracy Poll plugin.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Latest important updates:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New from version 2.3.0.0: A new shortcode was introduced for logged-in users to collect and display user comments related to individual polls. And from version 2.3.7.0 onward, a user template for automated use in the Democracy Poll textarea is available.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>New from version 2.2.0.0: Selection of roles is now possible for polls in order to easier control reminder emails and statistics.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>New from version 2.1.0.0: A new back-end tab was introduced to display the usage of the Democracy shortcode and the Foodle main shortcode.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>New from version 2.0.0.0: Major release with a number of improvements and enhancements.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Some General Considerations and more details:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The basic idea for this plugin was developed when the need for polls arrived for the choir I have the pleasure to be part of: <a href=\"https:\/\/voicesunlimited.de\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Voices Unlimited<\/a>.<br \/>\nThis plugin can be used by any organization, association, union, society, club or group of people when polls shall be executed and results be displayed in a structured way, e.g.:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For this or that choir rehearsal or planned public event to be scheduled, would sufficient Sopranos 1 or Tenors 2 be available?<\/li>\n<li>Or do the choir members support this or that idea and from which sub-group do they come from?<\/li>\n<li>Or what could be winning ideas for the next concert stage dress (Democracy Poll with answers to be brought by the voters and be displayed for everyone easy to understand) and would this spread nicely in color on stage, considering the choir&#8217;s stage order?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will surely translate all this into your own environment and your own needs&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Main feature<\/strong> is the Foodle shortcode, which allows to display poll results in a configurable table format. Alongside the Democracy Poll shortcode, it will display the results interactively by use of AJAX communication.<br \/>\nHowever, it can as well be used independently to just display poll results.<br \/>\nTogether with the WordPress comments function in pages or posts, this can be considered a good tool for online interaction with your registered (!) users.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Warning! Democracy Poll&#8217;s logging and IP storing option must be activated in order for Foodle to work.<\/strong> By this, all votes are stored in the database for Foodle to work with. You may select to avoid IP storage in each individual poll in order to avoid failures when voters share the same IP address, e.g. when voting in the same WLAN environment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The list of Foodle features comprises:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The interactive poll results table (shortcode &#8216;foodle-democracy-poll-list-log&#8217;)<\/li>\n<li>This shortcode only makes sense and therefore only works for registered users (else: no display) and registered voters (else: message)<\/li>\n<li>A shortcode for logged-in users (&#8216;foodle-comments&#8217;) to collect and display user comments related to individuall polls<\/li>\n<li>All other functions work regardless this necessary restriction<\/li>\n<li>Several Democracy Poll shortcodes on one page\/post (like before)<\/li>\n<li>Full shortcode flexibility: Several Foodle shortcodes &#8211; even for the same Democracy Poll id with differing parameters &#8211; on one page\/post<\/li>\n<li>Email reminders for users who are late to vote<\/li>\n<li>An unlimited number of user metafields to be defined and used (in user profile &#8211; can be switched off in Foodle settings)<\/li>\n<li>In the user profile, for already existing metafields as well used by Foodle, these can be deactiviated elsewhere in the user profile in order to just be filled in the user profile&#8217;s Foodle area<\/li>\n<li>A shortcode for a front-end interface to these extra user metafields<\/li>\n<li>Recovery of orphaned metafield field names, which still have data in the database (user meta)<\/li>\n<li>Deletion of data in the database (user meta) for metafield field names, which are orphaned<\/li>\n<li>Manual drag-n-drop fields sorting<\/li>\n<li>Careful (!) selection and use of existing user metafields<\/li>\n<li>Manual entry or drop-down entry in the user profile<\/li>\n<li>Automated filling of user metafields by use of Regular Expressions<\/li>\n<li>Easy overview and control over past user entries (normalization)<\/li>\n<li>Flexible sorting definitions<\/li>\n<li>Definition of role &amp; user plugin-internal capabilities<\/li>\n<li>Dashboard widget (and shortcode) to provide statistics and check for logical errors in democracy_q, democracy_a and democracy_log databases<\/li>\n<li>A shortcode to link to the Foodle page\/post<\/li>\n<li>A shortcode to display content based on roles<\/li>\n<li>A free name\/title definition for Foodle, e.g. for the user profile and the email<\/li>\n<li>Changeable highlighting of Foodle &amp; Democracy Poll in the admin menu and admin toolbar<\/li>\n<li>You can define a list of page\/post IDs where the AJAX interactivitiy is switched off.<\/li>\n<li>Switchable interactive explanations for all functions (&#8216;Help-Tooltips&#8217;)<\/li>\n<li>Warning-Tooltips can be disabled<\/li>\n<li>Help-Tooltips and Warning-Tooltips are available anywhere for the administrator (frontend and backend)<\/li>\n<li>A number of Foodle CSS classes to have the design control<\/li>\n<li>In parallel to the &#8216;administrator&#8217; role, managing Foodle can be delegated to other roles and their allowances can be tailored to your needs &#8211; some settings, however, will remain an administrator privilege (Foodle title, post exclusion, roles\/allowances and vote expiry)<\/li>\n<li>Tracking of Foodle shortcode usage in pages\/posts<\/li>\n<li>A user template for automated use in the textarea of Democracy Poll is available<\/li>\n<li>Download of Foodle tables to Excel format (Beta)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>In addition to that, functionality is added to Democracy Poll:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In multiple answers polls, you can combine checkboxes and radio buttons<\/li>\n<li>In each poll edit page, you may select from the available categories (user metafields) for display<\/li>\n<li>In each poll edit page, you may define the (main) category to be used for the category column<\/li>\n<li>In each poll edit page, you may define the related text of its sorting button<\/li>\n<li>In each poll edit page, you may decide whether to display an AJAX refresh button in the results displays (voted and\/or not voted)<\/li>\n<li>In each poll edit page, you may decide whether to have marked users to be counted (columns sums and first-come-first-serve answers)<\/li>\n<li>In each poll edit page, you may decide whether to prevent from storing the voters&#8217; IP adresses for this poll in order to preserve full functionality even when voters share the same IP address.<br \/><strong>Reminder:<\/strong> Democracy Poll&#8217;s logging and IP storing option must remain activated in order for Foodle to work!<\/li>\n<li>In each poll edit page, you may decide for which roles the related poll is intented.

For using Foodle, it is mandatory to switch Democracy&#8217;s logging and storing of IP addresses on! When re-voting, Democracy would delete all votes with same IP address. In order to avoid this, you can prevent Democracy from storing IP adresses in the Foodle area of each poll admin page.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='faq%20%233%3A%20i%20have%20a%20few%20brilliant%20ideas%20to%20further%20enhance%20this%20plugin.%20what%20should%20i%20do%3F'>\nFAQ #3: I have a few brilliant ideas to further enhance this plugin.
