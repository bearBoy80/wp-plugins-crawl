It was inspired by Jamie Humphries and his <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jamiehumphries\/photodex\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">photodex project<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Mimicking the in game pokedex the WP Photodex organizes the pokemon by pokedex number and shows your entire collection or one of your choosing. You can also show a single random pokemon.<\/p>\n<p>In the Admin section you can sort your posts by name, or by pokedex number. When you add a new post you assign it to a pokemon. Each pokemon can only be assigned once, if you want a new picture you&#8217;ll have to update the featured image of the original post or delete it and create a new one.<\/p>\n<p>Admin:<\/p>\n<p>The WP Pokemon Photodex plugin adds a tab to the admin for the Photodex post class.<\/p>\n<p>You can add new posts for each pokemon in your collection. For each post you select the pokemon from the Pokedex the post is associated with and select a featured image.<\/p>\n<p>When you load the Photodex section the default sort is by post date.
