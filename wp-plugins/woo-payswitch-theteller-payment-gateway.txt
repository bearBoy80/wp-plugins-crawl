Reason being cost-saving, wide reach and relative ease of management of clients and staff. Ghana, a developing nation has caught on to this recent rave. In doing this, Ghanaian e-commerce owners have also realized the ease, convenience and efficiency of using such a strategy with many choosing WordPress WooCommerce as their preferred E-Commerce system. However, the only inhibiting factor is the absence of a payment facilitation tool to complete the online buying experience.<\/p>\n<p>The advent of a free online payment tool developed by PaySwitch (Theteller) has made it possible for the wish of many e-commerce owners to be realized. We have therefore created this plug-in to enable the full integration of this payment tool with many e-commerce websites developed from WordPress with woocommerce.<\/p>\n<p>A version for OpenCart available here <a href=\"https:\/\/www.opencart.com\/index.php?route=marketplace\/extension\/info&amp;extension_id=35264&amp;filter_search=theteller\" title=\"Theteller OpenCart Payment Gateway\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"> Theteller OpenCart Payment Gateway<\/a><\/p>\n","installation":"<h4>Automatic Installation<\/h4>\n<p>\u2022   Login to your WordPress Admin area<br \/>\n\u2022   Go to \u201cPlugins &gt; Add New\u201d from the left hand menu<br \/>\n\u2022   In the search box type \u201ctheteller woocommerce payment gateway\u201d<br \/>\n\u2022   From the search result you will see \u201cPaySwitch TheTeller WooCommerce Payment Gateway\u201d click on \u201cInstall Now\u201d to install the plugin<br \/>\n\u2022   A popup window will ask you to confirm your wish to install the Plugin.<\/p>\n<h4>NOTE:<\/h4>\n<p>If this is your first time you\u2019ve installed a WordPress Plugin, you may need to enter the FTP login credential information.
