Just left them a negative review, which they lobbied Envato to remove. On Envato, the rule is - if you don't pay for support or haven't purchased within 12 months -&gt; you can't leave a review. This plugin was great a few years ago. Suddenly though they decided to invade your wordpress install with completely absurd verification software known as LCweb. This adds extra steps and controls that benefit them. Through this software they've also taken the ability to update the plugin with 1 click. Now you may only use the 1 click update feature if you KEEP paying for support. <br \/><br \/>Nowadays the plugin itself is utter garbage. Most of the largest WP themes (Divi, Avada, the7, all include better ways to display images. Mediagrid is outdated, invasive to your wordpress install, and in short useless. They shifted focus to data collection and revenue generation rather than quality and customer service. Their move to spinelessly have my review pulled from Envato's marketplace speaks to how small their long term thinking was. <br \/><br \/>I was a fan and a user, now I'm just someone that will rejoice when I don't see this plugin listed anymore. Steer clear. Bad stuff, bad people too.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">...<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pansenschim\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7e4ee992031d7e1591a5681aa73139e0?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7e4ee992031d7e1591a5681aa73139e0?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pansenschim\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">pansenschim<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 1, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">...<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great plugin for organizing a crapton of images<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"4 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"4\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/erindayta\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d53a9e02962eea2f9151b393c7a2f72c?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d53a9e02962eea2f9151b393c7a2f72c?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/erindayta\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">erindayta<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>I ended up using this for an apartments website with a huge number of floorplans, and it worked great! Very nice interface that displays beautifully on mobile.<\/p>\n<p>A few tiny improvements that could make this plugin perfect:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the way categories work within paginated grids -- currently, switching a category while in on a 2nd or later page doesn't work well<\/li>\n<li>Allow all items within a category to be added to a grid at once<\/li>\n<li>Output image titles -- we can input them but they don't output on the page, for either the thumbnail or the lightboxed version<\/li>\n<li>Make choosing images for Images Slider a little easier -- show filename or something? Probably not an issue for most people but I was uploading a bajillion very similar floorplans.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Thanks again for the great plugin!
