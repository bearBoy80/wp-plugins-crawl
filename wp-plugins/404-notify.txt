This plugin will automatically email the web site administrator (or a specified email address) whenever a 404 is encountered, along with a link to the page the 404 originated from. With this knowledge in hand, you can search the page for the problem and either remove or fix it.<\/p>\n<p>Notifications are also triggered by missing media, such as images, video, CSS files and more.<\/p>\n<h3>Support<\/h3>\n<p>Report any issues at the official <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/plugin\/404-notify\/\" rel=\"ugc\">404 Notify Support<\/a> WordPress page.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use<\/h3>\n<p>Once activated, notifications are automatially sent to the site administrator, or, you can specify an alternative email address in <strong>Settings<\/strong> -&gt; <strong>General<\/strong> and look for the <strong>404 Notify email address<\/strong> field.<\/p>\n<h3>Uninstall<\/h3>\n<p>Deactivate the plugin, delete if desired.<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Install, activate, done.<\/p>\n","faq":"<p><strong>Getting persistant notifications?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably got a missing asset on your page, most likely an image but it could be something else. It&#8217;s important to remember that a 404 can be instigated not only by a missing page, but also a missing asset such as an image, video, CSS file, JS file or anything else that can usually be directly accessed by a URL.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you&#8217;ve got a missing image in header.php (which gets called every time a page is loaded), then you&#8217;ll receive a notification every time a page is loaded until you fix the problem.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How can you find the path of a missing asset?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The eastest way is to open the website in <strong>Chrome<\/strong>, right click somewhere on the page and select <strong>Inspect<\/strong>, then click the <strong>Console<\/strong> tab and look for any mention of a 404. Any 404 errors will appear in red as demonstrated in the screenshot above.<\/p>\n<p>Once you can see the missing asset, you can fix the problem and the email notification will stop.<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.2.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Included visible URL in the email notification.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added custom email address notification field.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/404-notify\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2127630\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/404-notify\/assets\/screenshot-1.png?rev=2127630\" alt=\"screenshot-1.png\"><\/a><p>screenshot-1.png<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":"<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Job well done<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/nosaint\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c1c5187d9daefa858c645ffb5f60d73c?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c1c5187d9daefa858c645ffb5f60d73c?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/nosaint\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">nosaint<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 9, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">It works as presented.
