All you have to know about customizing and setting the widget is written in the manual. But if you need additional information write in the support.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can I change the weather icon set?<\/strong><br \/>\nOf course. Search the web, or draw your own icons and overwrite the default iconset. The deafault icon size is 57x57px<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can I change the weather background?<\/strong><br \/>\nYes, you can. The deafult height is 230px. You can overwrite it, in the img library<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does the widget slow down my side? How can I prevent this? <\/strong><br \/>\nThe weather forecast of a given location normally doesn?t change fastly. I built in a cache in the plugin.<br \/>\nThis helps in two things: The server of esotanc.hu doesn?t have to handle too many quests for weather data and your site should speed up a little bit, because your user will see the cached data!<\/p>\n","changelog":"<h4>1.0.9<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Release of plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","screenshots":"<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=664248\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=664248\" alt=\"300px wide and color-style five-day weather forecast\"><\/a><p>300px wide and color-style five-day weather forecast<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=664250\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=664250\" alt=\"300px wide and white-style five-day weather forecast\"><\/a><p>300px wide and white-style five-day weather forecast<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=664251\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=664251\" alt=\"300px wide and black-style five-day weather forecast\"><\/a><p>300px wide and black-style five-day weather forecast<\/p><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=664254\"><img src=\"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=664254\" alt=\"Control Panel\"><\/a><p>Control Panel<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","reviews":""},"download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather.zip","screenshots":{"1":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather\/assets\/screenshot-1.jpg?rev=664248","caption":"300px wide and color-style five-day weather forecast"},"2":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather\/assets\/screenshot-2.jpg?rev=664250","caption":"300px wide and white-style five-day weather forecast"},"3":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather\/assets\/screenshot-3.jpg?rev=664251","caption":"300px wide and black-style five-day weather forecast"},"4":{"src":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather\/assets\/screenshot-4.jpg?rev=664254","caption":"Control Panel"}},"tags":{"forecast":"forecast","weather":"weather","weather-forecast":"weather forecast","weather-report":"weather report","weather-widget":"weather widget"},"versions":{"1.1":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather.1.1.zip"},"donate_link":"","banners":{"low":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/weather-widget-esotanc-weather\/assets\/banner-772x250.jpg?rev=663861","high":false}}
