We had a very specific requirements list:  Make our event listing to look like the Kennedy Center's.  Event Prime can do.  Out of the box, with no tweaks, no extensions, no addons, Event Prime delivers a modern event grid, event list, and single event page.  <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Entering an event is done in the Classic Editor, but even for those of us who have never used Classic, entering an event has little to no learning curve.  Admin side of things is straightforward too, with easy to understand options.  There are some small things that need to be changed for US audiences, like date and time display formats, and support forum replies can be slow, but these are easily tolerated in a free plugin that does what we need.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">We tested 21 other cal plugins (no kidding), including the top two, and even three that haven't been developed in years.  Nothing suited.  We struggled mightily for two months with a different very popular event cal plugin, even getting their pro version, but at every turn a php file had to be changed or an @media rule added; and, changes were not intuitive, support articles gave conflicting info, and a change usually required tech support help.  Not so with EventPrime.  Their code is clean and we found only one tweak that needed a template change;  they have decent articles and very good file comments to help.  The other many tweaks were easily done in CSS, thus avoiding \"power users\/psuedo admins\" - or me! -  making a mistake in a template file and breaking the plugin.  <strong>After just one week with EventPrime, we had a fully tweaked calendar that made everyone smile - and gave me a sigh of relief.<\/strong>  Very glad we revisited and took a closer look at this gem of a plugin.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Thank you, EventPrime.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great plugin<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/lpint\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0450b2a0fb2d5842bbfb797db5f25661?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0450b2a0fb2d5842bbfb797db5f25661?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/lpint\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">lpint<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 20, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">I am switching from one of the other event calendar plugins because EventPrime works SO much better.

Then, there was a complete overhaul of the code and the \"migration tool\" broke my calendar, so I had to rebuild it from scratch, not fun. The new version is going to be the best calendar on the market but it's not finished, so I can only give it 4 stars but it will be a 5 star product in the very near future. I don't know if it was the sheer volume of support tickets I placed but eventually I seem to have been assigned to Hunny, and that has made a huge difference. Responses are much faster than before, and more importantly, my tweaks and feature requests are being implemented. It makes me feel like I'm part of the team and helping to shape the future of the product. It must have been an agonizing decision to rewrite the code but now we're seeing constant improvements. I hope they're all getting enough sleep because they are working their butts off to make this the <strong>best calendar<\/strong> <strong>ever<\/strong>.
