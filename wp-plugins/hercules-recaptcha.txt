If the user<br \/>\ndisables javascript and is not logged in then comments will fail to submit.<\/p>\n<p>The Recaptcha is also added to the registration page for both multisite setups and single blogs.  There are options for<br \/>\nhaving it show up on comments and\/or the registration page, as well as options for its position on the comment form, and<br \/>\nwhich style (Google gives only two options, dark or light).<\/p>\n","installation":"<p>Add this plugin by uploading the zip using the &#8220;Add Plugin&#8221; feature built into WordPress.
