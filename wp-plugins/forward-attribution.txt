The problem with this approach is that it&#8217;ll strip away the Amazon Attribution tags so you&#8217;ll lose that tracking.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin will check incoming traffic for the Amazon Attribution variables then search the page being viewed for outgoing links to Amazon and add these values to the link.
