you schedule a meeting with their VP. When we emailed their assistant to confirm the meeting time, the assistant never even bothered to respond, the result of which we waited for an initial meeting that did not happen. The second time we were more fortunate, but that's where the real issues begin. The first-tier premium version itself is overpriced at $1,300 a year, with limitations on number of events and the ability of people to pay for advertising. Now, onto the plug-in itself. The events are hosted on Time.ly's servers, which may result in your events being held hostage, as other reviewers have pointed out. However, the core issues have to do with functionality. Specific events are rendered via pop-ups, rather than distinct pages \u2014 again because you are essentially embedding a widget in events from THEIR website, not yours. In addition to this having NO SEO value (since specific events cannot be indexed), the tendency of a user is to use hit back button to get out of an event, which results in the user being taken to the website page BEFORE the calendar, which is a frustrating UX. (The pop-ups also had issues rendering on mobile, which is a serious issue. This is probably the result of substandard coding, such as the absolute positioning used in the free version.) Finally, communication with their team was frustratingly slow, with responses often taking a day or more. If this is the level of service they offer in pre-sales, one can only imagine how slow it will be once you are paying for something you cannot even back out of. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph
